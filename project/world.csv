Inputs by Mateen Hafeez and Clara Lewis

MUMBAI: Tensions rose in Dharavi after a large number of residents gathered on the streets to protest against the BMC 's move to demolish unauthorised construction at the Subhani mosque on the 90 ft road, forcing the civic team to discontinue the action on Saturday.Police registered a case after stones were pelted at a BMC vehicle . As a precautionary measure, police have deployed heavy bandobast in the area.A large crowd gathered to protest the BMC action at around 9 am.Subsequently, according to the BMC, after trustees of the mosque sought a period of four to five days to remove the encroached construction on their own, the BMC gave them that deadline. According to the civic body, an eviction notice was earlier served on the mosque and action was initiated as per the notice.The G-North ward had initiated action to carry out demolition of unauthorised parts of the mosque twice this year, the latest on Sept 5, but the action was stopped at the last moment on both occasions. Action was stopped in Jan due to instructions from top authorities.Political activists questioned the BMC action and claimed some repairs have been carried out for the safety of the structure and BMC has no right to now demolish the structure as the DRP ( Dharavi redevelopment project) has come into being and the mosque had a photo pass.""The police were not prepared, and they told us the situation could slip out of hands and result in violence. Meanwhile, the trustees too agreed to demolish the unauthorised construction on their own and sought more time,"" said a BMC official.Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis said those in-charge of the mosque have informed BMC they would remove the construction. ""There are past high court orders in this case. BMC in the past had initiated demolition action but mosque authorities had requested action be delayed till after Eid. This morning, when the BMC team reached the site for demolition, they were given a written assurance that the construction will be removed in 3-4 days. No one should try to create a law-and-order situation. That would not be proper,"" he said in Nagpur.Cabinet minister Mangalprabhat Lodha, who visited Dharavi police station, said, ""Those who attempted to take the law into their own hands will face appropriate action.""Ex-MP Kirit Somaiya demanded an investigation into a letter on the letterhead of the Subhani mosque in Dharavi that went viral on Saturday morning urging people to gather and stop the demolition. -","Residents protested against BMC's demolition of unauthorised construction at Subhani mosque.

You are free to assassinate Trump as well as me for that error in judgment,"" Routh reportedly wrote in his book.Federal charges against Routh currently include possessing a gun with a scratched-off serial number and possessing a firearm illegally as a felon. Additional charges may be pending, including aggravated assault for allegedly pointing the rifle at a Secret Service agent.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , addressing the case on Tuesday, stated that the state would pursue further charges against Routh, saying, ""His offense should merit life in prison.""As Routh awaits further legal developments, the investigation into his actions continues to deepen, with authorities probing his motives and connections in the lead-up to the attempted attack.","Ryan Routh, 58, allegedly aimed a rifle through the tree line while Trump played golf at his West Palm Beach course on September 15. Routh has not entered a plea but is scheduled to appear for a detention hearing, where prosecutors will seek to keep him jailed until his trial.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113604732,imgsize-1082307,width-400,resizemode-4/113604732.jpg"

"'Mother plotted the murder': UP family kills rape survivor, frames 'rapist' out on bail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/family-kills-rape-survivor-frames-rapist-out-on-bail/articleshow/113610873.cms,"'Family murdered girl assuming she was bringing disgrace to them'

Family murdered girl assuming she was bringing disgrace to them, say police

BAREILLY: When the story broke from Sambhal last week, news reports claimed a minor survivor had been shot dead by her alleged rapist who was out on bail. It made for dramatic headlines. The girl, 17, was on a bike with her mother and brother when she was killed. However, a deeper investigation revealed a darker truth - it was her mother, two brothers and uncle who meticulously planned and executed her murder.Police began questioning the narrative put out by her family when the mother and brother survived the attack without a scratch.That puzzled cops. After all, as the local media reported initially, three men in a car had waylaid the family travelling on the motorcycle, pumped three bullets into the girl and fled.Behind it was Rinku Kumar , the man accused of raping her. But that version unravelled rapidly. CCTV footage surfaced showing Rinku at a hospital, attending to his dying father at the exact time of the murder. This spun the probe in a different direction.As the probe progressed, police questioned the girl's family. And they eventually broke. It then emerged that the mother had plotted the murder, fearing her daughter, who had eloped to Ghaziabad with Rinku previously, would not testify in court that he had raped her. (A rape case had been filed against Rinku as the girl was a minor.)As the interrogation went on, police found that the girl's mother had recently brought her back from Ghaziabad. Once she was back home in Sambhal, on the day of the murder, the mother had persuaded the teenager to come with her and her sibling on a bike to meet a relative. Unknown to the unsuspecting girl, her uncle was waiting with a loaded gun. He emptied three bullets into her.Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar told TOI on Monday, ""The family had planned to murder their daughter as they assumed that she was bringing disgrace to them. She was then murdered by her mother, maternal uncle, who lives in Ghaziabad, and two brothers, in their 20s and working in a private company.""Kumar added, ""Rinku's father died in a private hospital shortly after the incident. They were seen on CCTV there. The claims of the girl's family raised suspicions since no one else was injured in the attack on her. We used mobile surveillance and gathered evidence from the scene, leading to the mother and others being detained. They confessed to killing her for the family's honour and showed no remorse after their arrest.""","The girl, 17, was on a bike with her mother and brother when she was killed.

"Nearly 500 dead as Israel strikes 1,300 targets in Lebanon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/nearly-500-dead-as-israel-strikes-1300-targets-in-lebanon/articleshow/113615935.cms,"Israel launched airstrikes on targets across southern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people in one of the deadliest days of fighting in nearly two decades and fanning fears of all-out war.Some 1,650 people were wounded in the strikes and about 100 women and children were among the dead, the Lebanese health ministry said. Israeli officials said many of those killed were members of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah , and argued that the group had placed rocket launchers in private homes.The strikes were a major escalation just days after an attack in which pagers and walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded. Israel didn’t take credit for that campaign but the group blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government.“I want to clarify Israel’s policy: we do not wait for the threat, we are ahead of it,” Netanyahu said Monday. He predicted “complicated days” ahead.One Israeli military official said the country is focused on an aerial campaign to degrade Hezbollah’s military capabilities, suggesting a major ground invasion was not imminent.Israel Intensifies Strikes Into Lebanon | Israeli air campaign in Lebanon on Sept. 21–22But a senior US official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said it’s important to take seriously Israel’s preparations for an invasion and that the US is focused on breaking the escalatory cycle.In any event, it was the deadliest day of strikes since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The strikes occurred as world leaders including Netanyahu were descending upon New York for the annual high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip was set to be a focus.The US is urging restraint and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has spoken to Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant several times in recent days, stressing the need for a diplomatic solution.The two sides have been exchanging cross-border rocket fire almost daily since Israel’s war with Hamas erupted last October, but the conflict has stepped up in the past week.The US will send a “small number” of additional troops to the Middle East, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said without elaborating. NBC News reported the military personnel may be ready to help Americans evacuate from Lebanon, adding the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier group could be sent to the region to augment the American military presence.The State Department warned Americans in an updated advisory dated Sept. 21 against traveling to Lebanon and said its embassy “may not be able to assist US citizens who choose to remain.” The department also urged US citizens to depart Lebanon via commercial options while they are still available.Netanyahu has said he would prefer using diplomacy to stop Hezbollah’s attacks, but such efforts are failing. His cabinet made the return of tens of thousands of civilians displaced from Israel’s north by the threat of attacks a primary war objective last week, while Gallant has said the military’s focus should shift from Gaza and Hamas to the northern front and Hezbollah.Both Hezbollah and Hamas are sponsored by Iran and considered terrorist organizations by the US.In a video message to the Lebanese people, Netanyahu added: “The IDF has warned you to get out of harm’s way. I urge you – take this warning seriously.”In northern Israel, hundreds of thousands of people rushed to bomb shelters after 250 projectiles were fired early Monday. Hezbollah has access to a new type of rocket that can reach as far as 100 kilometers (62 miles) and carry 170 kilograms of explosives in its warhead, the organization said on its Telegram channel over the weekend.Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli army sites north of Haifa as sirens sounded, including in civilian areas. Israeli medics said eight people were wounded in northern Israel as a result of the Hezbollah assault. Israeli police reported a house being hit and rockets falling in several places in the Lower Galilee.In New York, Danny Danon, Israel’s UN ambassador, said in an interview that “Hezbollah has placed rocket launchers in private homes and other civilian facilities” and Israel had urged those nearby “to move away from those locations.”Netanyahu is scheduled to address the General Assembly this week, though his travel itinerary hasn’t yet been finalized.Danon said Netanyahu was scheduled to land in the US on Thursday morning, “speak at the UN on Friday morning and to head back to Israel Saturday night. Now, it can change, because we will follow the events in Israel.”Until last week, Israel and Hezbollah largely focused their strikes on areas near the border. Yet Israel has grown increasingly frustrated with its inability to stop Hezbollah’s missile and drone attacks.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Hezbollah and Lebanon blamed Israel for blowing up thousands of pagers and walkie talkies mostly used by members of the group. The two-day operation in Lebanon killed at least 39 people, including civilians and children, and injured thousands.Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the UN and world powers to act quickly to stop Israel and Hezbollah “falling into the unknown.”Hezbollah is a Shiite militant organization that, like Hamas, Iran has trained and funded. It is considered the most powerful non-state force in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of missiles and fighters at its disposal. It’s also a political party with substantial support in Lebanon.Also on Monday, an Israeli military spokesperson said it’s possible Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has been wounded or killed in air strikes on Gaza, after local media reported he has been incommunicado.“Regarding what has surfaced over the last day about Sinwar, I do not rule it out nor do I confirm it,” added the spokesperson, Daniel Hagari.The Israeli government says Sinwar masterminded the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. Last month, he was promoted to succeed the group’s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran, and is now the point-man for long-deadlocked talks mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt.The US has said that a cease-fire in Gaza will help calm regional tensions. Israel’s government says it cannot wait for a truce in the Palestinian territory before neutering the threat of Hezbollah.Hamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage with its assault last Oct. 7. Israel’s subsequent air and ground offensive has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between combatants and civilians.","The US will send a “small number” of additional troops to the Middle East, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said. The two sides have been exchanging cross- border rocket fire almost daily since Israel’s war with Hamas erupted last October.

Princess Diana 's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book ' Dancing with Diana ' explaining an early sign of a doomed marriage that she picked up from an incident -- among many other recollections. In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. It was meant to be a surprise for Charles but it became a shock for him as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown with no stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling"". That's it. Charles immediately went on to doing something else. ""And when you’ve come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you’re doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body. "" I’m not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""But all that Diana was hoping was to light a spark in their marriage.""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that’s what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""""I think she was much more able to see the possibility of how romance should be. I’m not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""The performance was kept under the wrap till the last moment.""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That’s what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, ‘I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don’t want to make things difficult.’""Princess Diana and Anne became friends later. And as a friend, the princess often asked Anne for her advice. ""I know he is seeing Camilla again,"" said Diana about her husband’s mistress, as quoted in the book. ""Why does he not love me? I really don’t understand.""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don’t always agree. There’s no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can’t keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It’s not at all what I want. I’d like the marriage to work, but it just isn’t for now. Do I just put up with it, hoping he will change?""","Princess Diana's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book'Dancing with Diana'In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London.

Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old from Hawaii, was detained in connection with the event.Trump claimed, ""The Kamala Harris/Joe Biden Department of Justice and FBI are mishandling and downplaying the second assassination attempt on my life since July.""Trump criticised the charges brought against the suspect, describing them as minor. He linked this to what he calls ongoing legal actions against him, stating, ""The charges brought against the maniac assassin are a slap on the wrist. It's no wonder since the DOJ and FBI have been coming after me nonstop with Weaponised Lawfare since I announced my first Historic Campaign for the Presidency"".He also expressed concerns about the neutrality of the federal agencies investigating these incidents. ""It's very difficult to trust the Biden/Harris DOJ/FBI to investigate the assassination attempts, due to Election Interference and the fake cases brought against me,"" Trump stated.Referring to a previous incident, Trump said, ""Shockingly, after the bullet went through my ear on that fateful day in Butler, Pennsylvania, the FBI Director went before Congress and falsely said that it may not have been a bullet, 'It was just glass or shrapnel' - a lie condemned by even my worst enemies.""The first assassination attempt occurred on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet reportedly grazed Trump's ear during a rally.Trump requested that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis take over the investigation, arguing, ""If the DOJ and FBI cannot do their job honestly and without bias, and hold the aspiring assassin responsible to the full extent of the Law, Governor Ron DeSantis and the State of Florida have already agreed to take the lead on the investigation and prosecution.""He emphasized that Florida would handle the case more rigorously than federal authorities, stating, ""The TRUTH would be followed, wherever it leads. Our justice system is corrupt and discredited, especially as it pertains to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump.

His Make America Great Again (MAGA) PAC added $25 million, leaving him with $295 million in funds as of the end of August.Harris’ financial advantage has enabled her to dominate TV advertising, though she continues to avoid high-profile sit-down interviews as per the New York Post.Tesla founder Elon Musk made a significant contribution of $289,100 to Republican efforts and endorsed Trump, to secure congressional seats, according to FEC filings.Trump has claimed that if he loses the upcoming presidential election on November 5, he may not run again in 2028. “I think … that will be it"", he said.","US Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is outspending her Republican rival and former US President Donald Trump by nearly $5 million a day.

However, the video was manipulated by supporters of Donald Trump , known as the Dilley Meme Team. Despite revealing that the video was fake, it had amassed over 420,000 views and was widely shared among Spanish-speaking people.“It’s everywhere, this doubt: ‘Is this person a communist?’” said Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a cultural strategist from south Florida. She recalled hearing discussions about the meme on the Spanish-language radio station La Nueva Poderosa in Miami. While the station clarified the story was “not true,” the hosts maintained their belief that “Kamala is a Marxist .”Samantha Barrios, a Venezuelan-American in Miami, accused right-leaning Spanish media of frightening immigrants, saying, “the main reason that we left our countries was to escape these regimes.”Some immigrants express frustration with the Democrats for not properly addressing their concerns about political repression in their home countries. However, Barrios warned against the way these legitimate fears are weaponised through false claims about Harris. Pérez-Verdía criticised the Democratic campaign for not taking these fears seriously. “Don’t laugh off people’s fears. It’s really disrespectful,” she said.The Digital Democracy Institute of the Americas (DDIA) has reported that notable right-wing figures have propagated a “fear of socialism” since 2020.

Gen. Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do.The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region.On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman , two destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the US could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out.“In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region. But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.”The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned Lebanese civilians in a videotaped message to evacuate their homes ahead of a widening air campaign. He spoke as Israeli warplanes continued to strike alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon.The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases.“Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the State Department cautioned Saturday. Ryder would not say if those additional forces might support the evacuation of those citizens if needed.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region, Ryder said.“Given the tensions, given the escalation, as I highlighted, there is the potential for a wider regional conflict. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it’s a dangerous situation,” Ryder said.The US presence in the Middle East is designed both to help defend Israel and protect US and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks.","Pentagon would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do.

Mark Robinson: US Presidential Election Top 10: How Trump is making Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘dream’ come true with Mark Robinson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-top-10-how-trump-is-making-martin-luther-king-jrs-dream-come-true-with-mark-robinson/articleshow/113607473.cms,"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character.

Little did Martin Luther King Jr know that one day, America would become so ""DEIfied"" that even a black man, judged by the content of his character and the content he produced, would be openly embraced by white supremacists.Three-and-a-half decades ago, a footballer named Mark Robins was credited with saving Sir Alex Ferguson’s career as manager, after which Manchester United became the dominant force in English football. Now, a man named Mark Robinson might just cause Donald Trump’s downfall in the crucial swing state of North Carolina , even if he brings Martin Luther King Jr’s dream of racial equity to life in a perverse way. And, of course, Donald Trump has called him “Martin Luther King Jr on steroids.”Robinson’s bona fides as a racist are quite remarkable, even for a conservative politician, irrespective of his skin colour.Under his online persona ‘mindsoldr,’ Robinson posted extensively on a porn site called Nude Africa, which is rather disturbing, as who posts their racist thoughts on a porn website? The web page’s comments forum became Robinson’s canvas for his observations on race, sex, gender, and slavery. Most of his comments are the exact opposite of his public persona, reminiscent of the old joke that the Republican National Convention is the Super Bowl for Grindr.For example, Robinson, who is rather vocal in the bathroom debate, admitted to being a “peeping Tom” as a 14-year-old. He also claimed to be a connoisseur of ‘tranny-on-girl porn’ and added that it took the “man out while leaving the man in.”He said he wasn’t in the KKK because they didn’t let black people join, but if he was, he would call MLK Jr “Martin Lucifer Koon.” Describing himself as a black Nazi, he said slavery wasn’t all that bad and wished he could bring it back so he could own a few.During Obama’s presidency, he said he’d prefer Adolf Hitler and, like any true equal-opportunity racist, he was equally bigoted towards black, Jewish, and Muslim individuals. He called MLK Jr a “commie bastard” who was “worse than a maggot” and a ‘huckster.’ He also referred to Muslims as “little rag-headed bastards” and wrote that if “Muslims took over, liberals would be the first ones to be beheaded.”While Trump was reportedly warned about Robinson and his gubernatorial candidacy, including his remarks disparaging the civil rights movement and mocking victims of school shootings, Trump didn’t particularly care even when Robinson called child survivors who advocated for gun control “media prosti-tots,” accused Michelle Obama of being a man, liberally used the slur ‘hebe,’ a common pejorative term for Jews, and suggested it was acceptable to send violent protesters to the Elysian Fields.Trump seems to have learned his lesson, given that he recently held an event in North Carolina where Robinson was neither mentioned nor invited. Meanwhile, several top operatives of Robinson’s gubernatorial campaign have quit, and Trump’s former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admits that he is “weighed down by a very unpopular Republican candidate for governor.”Trump currently holds a narrow lead over Harris (49% to 47%), and while North Carolina leans Republican, there’s always the danger of reverse coattails. It’s worth noting that the poll was conducted before the Mark Robinson allegations surfaced, and the state is absolutely crucial to Trump’s chances of returning to the White House.Everything is usually measured with the benefit of hindsight, and we are in an election where Nancy Pelosi, Dick Cheney, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page. Time will tell if Robinson’s deeply disturbing Uncle Peeping Tom act and his desire to “kiss and post” will cost Trump. Many years ago, Simon and Garfunkel sang: “And here's to you, Mrs Robinson. Jesus loves you more than you will know.” Given Mr Robinson’s stellar racist credentials, it’s a tough task for Jesus as well.","Mark Robinson, a Republican candidate for North Carolina governor, has been accused of being a racist.

They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing. The case stems from a March 2023 NAB probe into the Al-Qadir University Trust, alleging that Khan and his wife received large sums of money and real estate from Malik Riaz Hussain, a real estate magnate, in exchange for Rs 50 billion. The amount had been part of a settlement with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and later adjusted against a Supreme Court fine imposed on Hussain.","Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seek acquittal.

"Two Hindu girls 'abducted' in Pakistan's Sindh province, community demands protection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-hindu-girls-abducted-in-pakistans-sindh-province-community-demands-protection/articleshow/113435455.cms,"KARACHI: Two Hindu girls have been abducted from their homes in Pakistan's southern Sindh province in recent days, community leaders said and demanded safeguards to stop ""frequent kidnappings"" and "" forced conversions "". Shiva Kachi, a Hindu community leader from Hyderabad, said, ""We are getting information about such incidents nearly every week now from different parts of the province and no one seems to care.There is so much fear in the Hindu community now.""Kachi heads the Pakistan Darewar Ittehad , an organisation which is fighting for the recovery of Hindu girls kidnapped, allegedly forcibly converted to Islam and married off to Muslim men who are much older in many instances.In the recent days there have been two incidents in Khairpur and Mirpurkhas of two girls being abducted from their homes by armed men, he said.In the first instance, a 16-year-old girl was kidnapped from her home in Khairpur while a class 7th student was abducted from Digri town near Mirpurkhas.Kachi said in the first case, a Muslim youth claimed she eloped with him and married him after converting to Islam.He said the Pakistan government and provincial authorities needed to place safeguards to ensure the safety of the Hindu community.Ramesh Kumar, a social activist from Hyderabad city, claims once the girls are abducted, even the police don't cooperate and refuse to file FIRs on behalf of the affected families who are mostly uneducated and poor.""There is a nexus between some clerics, policemen and influential Muslims and the Hindu community suffers,"" he claimed.Hindus are not the only minority who claim they are discriminated against and face injustice. On Tuesday, an Ahmadi family (Ahmadiyyas are declared non-Muslims in Pakistan) saw their under-construction house vandalised in Karachi's Shah Faisal colony.""Everything was okay. We've been constructing the house for the last few months but yesterday someone spread the rumour that Ahmadis were building a worship place and today a mob came and badly damaged the under-construction building,"" Shahid Ahmed said.In many instances, the 500,000-strong Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan don't reveal themselves openly for fear of repercussions.Kumar also referred to the incident of firing in a Hindu temple, Rama Par, in Hyderabad city and said so far the police were delaying arresting all those responsible for entering the temple and opening fire during a religious ceremony.Scores of Hindus held a protest on Monday in Hyderabad demanding the arrest of those responsible for the alleged assault on the temple in which five people were injured.""Police have filed complaints against 11 people but made just two arrests,"" he said.A religious ceremony was taking place at the temple when a scuffle broke out between two groups of the Hindu community and this led to the involvement of outsiders who came and opened fire in the temple while the ceremony had not finished.","Two Hindu girls have been abducted from their homes in Pakistan's southern Sindh province in recent days.

Militants in Pakistan used PUBG features to attack police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/militants-in-pakistan-used-pubg-features-to-attack-police-station/articleshow/113390618.cms,"Militants in Swat , Pakistan, utilized features from the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) to plan and execute an attack on a local police station, reported Dawn.Militants targeted the Banr police station in Swat on August 28, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to two others. In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
