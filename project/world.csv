HYDERABAD: Barely seven months after he was cleared of having links with Maoists by Bombay HC, which called the trial court proceedings a “failure of justice”, former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences hospital. Doctors said he was admitted for removal of gallstones and died of post-surgery complications.The 57-year-old wheelchair-bound teacher and activist spent over seven years in jail after he was first arrested in May 2014.He was acquitted in March by the HC. “When I went to prison, I had no ailm ent other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,” he’d said on his release.Acquitting him, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had called the trial court proceedings a “failure of justice”, and pointed out the lack of sanction under UAPA to prosecute him. It also said the prosecution had failed to establish the seizure of incriminating material from his house.“When I went to prison, I had no ailments other than my disability. Now, my heart i s only 55% functional, and I am facing muscular complications. My liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected. My right hand is partially functional. My doctor says I need multiple surgeries,” he had told reporters after his release on March 6.“I couldn’t go to the prison hospital. There was not a single access ramp for the disabled in the jail, no separate toilets. I was always physically lifted for my toilet and bath needs. How can one live like that?” he had said. Saibaba was kept in the ‘anda cell’ (solitary confinement) atNagpur central jail , which, he said, affected him mentally as well.Probe agencies came across Saibaba’s name allegedly after the arrest of a JNU student who claimed to have been acting as a courier between the professor and Maoists holed up in Abujhmarh forests in Chhattisgarh. Saibaba was arrested by Maharashtra police for allegedly conspiring to wage war against the nation besides violations under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). A Gadchiroli court convicted him of the charges and awarded him life imprisonment in 2017. After a prolonged legal battle, he was acquitted by the high court.“Saibaba played a key role in several people’s movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,” said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression, who knew Saibaba for 35 years.Saibaba was born in Anakapalli in AP. After graduating, he p ursued his postgraduation in University of Hyderabad. He was working as an English professor in Delhi University until he was arrested. After he was released from jail, he underwent medical treatment in Delhi for various health complications — a fallout of his prolonged stay in jail. He is survived by his wife and daughter.His friends and colleaguesremembered Saibaba, whom they fondly called Sai, as a fighter. “He got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,” said Nandita Narain, former St Stephen’s College professor. “I learnt about him when I was elected member of DU’s Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didn’t have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.”Narain added, “Those 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.” She also remembered, “When he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.”Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, viceprincipal of St Stephen’s. “We had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friends”.Gabriel said Saibaba hadn’t ever been fragile. “Then we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,” she said. “I spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.”(With inputs from Meghna Dhulia)",Former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences.

The prisoners, one serving a life sentence and another awaiting trial, escaped unnoticed until it was too late for prison authorities to track them.Even as Haridwar was agog with rumours that the two escapees were playing the role of monkeys in the ‘vanar sena’ (Lord Ram’s army of monkeys) and pretending to search for Sita when they fled, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered a probe into the incident.The investigation will be headed by DIG Prison. Meanwhile, six jail staffers have been suspended on charges of dereliction of duty.One of the escapees, Pankaj , is a sharpshooter from Praveen Valmiki gang, and was sentenced to life for the murder of a sanitation worker in Roorkee.

During the Ramlila performance, they used the distraction to tie the ladders with clothes and scale the prison wall.Jail authorities had started the tradition of Ramlila inside the prison a few years ago, allowing inmates to take part in acting while others, including guards, watched.Cops have filed a case and formed several teams to hunt for the accused.

NIA probes sabotage angle in train accident near Chennai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-probes-sabotage-angle-in-train-accident-near-chennai/articleshow/114180064.cms,"Photo by C Suresh Kumar

CHENNAI: NIA is investigating whether sabotage caused the Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express to veer off the main line and collide with a parked goods train Friday night at Kavarapettai station , 40km north of Chennai. The collision injured eight people and overturned 12 coaches.There were no casualties, as the coupling of the advanced Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches prevents telescoping, and the train was traveling at 90 kmph or less.“The reason for the accident could be many. A worn-out signal operating panel in the station master’s room or ongoing signal modification work in the area. But sabotage cannot be ruled out and needs to be investigated,” said a railway source.Officials are investigating how the express train entered the loop line, where the speed limit is only 30 kmph, despite receiving a green signal for the main line. Southern Railway general manager RN Singh confirmed that the driver followed the signals correctly after leaving Chennai. A suburban train heading towards Gummidipoondi had left Kavarapettai station minutes earlier, and Bagmati Express was given a green signal for the main line. Yet, the train inexplicably entered the loop line, resulting in the crash.Officials are also probing whether tampering with outdoor signalling gear and switch points at Kavarapettai station led to train switching from the main line to a loop line. Sources informed TOI that bolts and brackets at the switch point were found opened and several nuts were missing, raising concerns about sabotage. The accident comes on the heels of a similar tampering attempt reported in Sept at nearby Ponneri station.The switch point is a crucial mechanism that enables trains to shift from one track to another. Properly functioning signalling equipment is essential to ensure these transitions occur safely, following green or red signals displayed to the train driver. Any malfunction or tampering with these components could lead to trains being diverted onto incorrect tracks, significantly increasing the risk of accidents.On Saturday morning, southern circle commissioner of railway safety AM Chowdhary inspected the accident site, joined by NIA officers.The inquiry will begin next week, Chowdhary said. More than a dozen officials, including the driver of Bagmati Express, his assistant, and the on-duty station masters of Kavarapettai and Ponneri stations, will be summoned for questioning.Personnel from CRS and NIA inspected the site, with railway officials confirming that while the route and signal were correctly set for the main line, the train’s diversion to the loop line was “unusual”.","NIA investigating whether sabotage caused Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express to veer off the main line and collide with a parked goods train.

How many Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave?



National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah on Saturday appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits to ""come back home"". The Kashmiri Hindu community faced a mass exodus in the early 1990s when armed insurgency and terrorism peaked in the Valley, forcing them to flee Kashmir In an assurance to the Kashmiri Pandits, Abdullah, who is also J&K's former CM, said they ""should feel that the National Conference government is not their enemy"".""I hope that our brothers and sisters who have left from here come back home. Now the time has come, they should return to their homes. We do not think only about Kashmiri Pandits, but we also think about the people of Jammu, we should treat them well, they should also feel that the National Conference government is not their enemy. We are Indians and we want to take everyone along,"" Farooq Abdullah said.Abdullah's NC party, in alliance with the Congress party, swept the recently concluded J&K assembly polls, bagging 42 seats in the 90-member House while the Congress won six seats.In the polls, more than 35,000 displaced Kashmiri Pandits from across the country were eligible to vote at 24 polling stations in the first phase of the three-phased Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir In the second phase, nearly 40 per cent of eligible Kashmiri Pandits cast their ballots across the polling stations in Jammu, Delhi and Udhampur.The Kashmiri Pandits registered a voter turnout of over 30 per cent in the third and final phase of the elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Spread across 16 assembly segments in three districts of North Kashmir, out of 18,357 registered displaced Pandit voters, 5,545 turned up to cast their votes at 24 specially designated polling booths in Jammu, Udhampur and Delhi-NCR.The migration numbers have changed a lot over time, even in official records, presumably because they are constantly updated.In the years right after Kashmiri Pandits started leaving, the government put out an estimate of 50,000 families who had left Kashmir because of militancy.The 2022 estimate is actually lower — at 44,684. The number of migrant people, according to the Union ministry of home affairs in 2022, is a little over 1.5 lakh.","National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits to ""come back home"" The Kashmiri Hindu community faced a mass exodus in the early 1990s when armed insurgency and terrorism peaked in the Valley.

India has expressed concern over the safety of peacekeepers following an incident along the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel. Two United Nations peacekeepers were injured by an Israeli strike while the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) were engaging Hezbollah . The Blue Line, established in the 1970s, has been a longstanding point of tension.The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations has expressed its full support for the joint statement issued by the 34 countries contributing troops to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ).India, being a major contributor of troops, emphasised the paramount importance of ensuring the safety and security of peacekeepers in accordance with the existing UN Security Council resolutions.The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations said, ""As a major Troop Contributing Country, India aligns itself fully with the joint statement issued by the 34 UNIFIL troop contributing countries. Safety and security of peacekeepers are of paramount importance and must be ensured in accordance with extant UNSC Resolutions.""The United Nations Security Council established UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in response to Israel's ""invasion"" of Lebanese territory. Since its inception in 1978, UNIFIL has been deployed along the ""Blue Line,"" the border demarcating Lebanon and Israel. The UN Security Council extended the peacekeeping mission's mandate for an additional year in August, ensuring its continued presence in the region.The ministry of external affairs also commented on the situation, stressing the need for measures to protect UN personnel. ""We are concerned at the deteriorating security situation along the Blue Line. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Inviolability of UN premises must be respected by all, and appropriate measures taken to ensure the safety of UN peacekeepers and the sanctity of their mandate,"" said the MEA.Meanwhile, IDF acknowledged the concern for the injured peacekeepers and explained the circumstances. ""Earlier today (Friday), IDF soldiers operating in southern Lebanon identified an immediate threat against them. The soldiers responded with fire toward the threat. An initial examination indicates that during the incident, a hit was identified on a @UNIFIL_post, located approximately 50 meters from the source of the threat, resulting in the injury of two UNIFIL personnel,"" IDF had said on X.Meanwhile, directly addresseing the situation, the spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) Andrea Tenenti said that UN peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon have decided to maintain their positions near the border, despite the recent injuries sustained by five of their members and the damage to their facilities during the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.According to Tenenti, Israel had requested UNIFIL to withdraw from positions ""up to five kilometres (three miles) from the Blue Line"" that separates the two countries. However, the peacekeepers unanimously decided to refuse this request, which would have affected all 29 of their positions in the southern region of the country. Tenenti stated, ""There was a unanimous decision to stay because it's important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the Security Council.""Tenenti also expressed concern that the recent escalation by Israel against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah could potentially escalate into ""a regional conflict with catastrophic impact for everyone"", emphasising that the only viable solution is through diplomatic means.","India has expressed concern over the safety of peacekeepers following an incident along the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel.

MUMBAI: Mumbai police arrested two men in connection with the shooting of NCP leader and former Maharashtra MLA Baba Siddique in Bandra (East) on Saturday night.The accused, Gurmel Singh from Haryana and Dharamraj Kashyap from Uttar Pradesh, both in their 20s, are currently in police custody and will be presented before the Esplanade Court by noon today, officials confirmed on Sunday.The accused had done recce of Baba Siddiqui 's house and office premises, they were in Mumbai for one and a half to two months and were keeping an eye on him.The police are also on the lookout for a third suspect, believed to have fled the scene after the attack.The shooting occurred around 9.30pm near Siddique's son Zeeshan’s office in Bandra, when three assailants arrived on foot and opened fire as the 66-year-old leader was getting into his vehicle.He sustained bullet injuries to his chest and was declared dead on arrival at Lilavati Hospital. While two of the attackers were apprehended by members of the public and police, the dense locality prevented them from fleeing the scene.A senior crime branch official said, ""We are inquiring whether this was the handiwork of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang , but we want to be sure.""The arrested men, however, are claiming innocence and shifting blame to the third suspect who managed to escape.Police are still probing the exact motive behind Siddique's murder, and one line of inquiry is a possible connection to a dispute involving the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), in which Siddique was involved.Additionally, given Siddique’s close ties with actor Salman Khan, who had been previously threatened by the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, police are examining if there is any gang involvement in the killing.Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde expressed shock and concern over the incident, calling it ""extremely unfortunate."" He assured the public that swift action would be taken, with the third accused expected to be caught soon. ""The police are actively chasing the third accused, and all three will be tried in a fast-track court,"" Shinde stated.Sharad Pawar, chief of the NCP, voiced his concern over the situation, questioning the government’s handling of law and order. “If the ruling side and home minister continue to run the government with this softness, it’s an alarming sign,” he remarked, calling for greater accountability.Siddique, a three-time MLA from Bandra West, had been granted Y-category security 15 days prior to his murder after receiving threats. Despite being provided with a personal security officer, no one else was injured during the attack.Siddique had joined Ajit Pawar's faction of the NCP earlier this year after leaving the Congress, where he had been a prominent figure for over four decades.Police are currently reviewing CCTV footage from the area to piece together the exact sequence of events. The body of Siddique was transferred to Cooper Hospital for post-mortem on Sunday morning, as a large crowd of politicians, celebrities, and supporters gathered at Lilavati Hospital overnight to pay their respects.The case is drawing increasing attention, not only for Siddique’s political prominence but also for the potential involvement of organized criminal elements in the killing.","Mumbai police have arrested two men in connection with the shooting of NCP leader Baba Siddique in Bandra (East) on Saturday night.

BHOPAL: While most people celebrated the victory of good over evil by burning the effigy of Ravan , a village in Madhya Pradesh ’s Vidisha district worshipped ‘ Ravan Baba ’ as an annual ritual on Dussehra on Saturday.The village panchayat is also named after Ravan and is called Ravan Panchayat , situated under Nateran Janpad of the district.“It’s an age-old tradition here.Ravan Baba, as the villagers call it, is worshipped as the First God or ‘ Kul Devta ’ in this village. After worship, a ‘ bhandara ’ was also held in the village. The locals offer oil on the navel of the Ravana idol. The idol is in a lying position,” said secretary of the Ravan Panchayat, Jagdish Prasad Sharma.There is no official information, but locals estimate the lying idol of Ravana with ten heads is more than 500 years old. Not only is there a temple for the demon king , but the deity is considered so important that during marriages, it is Ravana who is given the first invitation.Representative of the Village Sarpanch Preet Kirar, Rajesh Dhakad, said, “On Dussehra we worshipped ‘Ravan Baba’, then ‘aarti’ was held, and thereafter a ‘bhandara’ was also held. In the case of marriages, the first invitation is given to the deity.”Sources said that there are several anecdotes and myths associated with the idol. One story says that at a nearby hill, Dudha Hill, there was a demon in ancient times who used to trouble local villagers. They challenged him that if he was so powerful, he should go and fight with ‘ Lankesh ’. The demon then rushed towards Lanka , but the guards of Ravan did not let him go inside. He kept trying until one day, ‘Lankesh’ came hearing his cries and then fought with the demon.After killing the demon, Lankesh put his sword at the village pond and then took a little rest. This way, the resting or lying position of the idol is justified through myths, say locals.","Ravan Baba, as the villagers call it, is worshipped as the First God or ‘ Kul Devta ’ in this village.

Pakistan prepares for SCO Summit amidst security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-prepares-for-sco-summit-amidst-security-concerns/articleshow/114180796.cms,"Representative image.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

A US army soldier has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to aid ISIS in planning attacks on American troops, the Department of Justice revealed. Cole Bridges, from Stow, Ohio, was found guilty of trying to support the terrorist group and conspiring to murder US soldiers, as reported by ABC News.24-year-old Bridges, who joined the Army in 2019, was a cavalry scout in the Third Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia.Before enlisting, he had started exploring jihadist propaganda online, expressing his support for ISIS on social media. By October 2020, he was communicating with an FBI undercover agent posing as an ISIS supporter in contact with fighters in the Middle East.“Bridges provided training and guidance to purported ISIS fighters who were planning attacks, including advice about potential targets in New York City,” the DOJ said. He also sent the FBI agent portions of a US Army training manual, believing it would assist ISIS in their operations.In December 2020, Bridges increased his involvement by supplying instructions on how to ambush US forces in the Middle East. He shared diagrams and tactics intended to help ISIS maximise the effectiveness of their attacks. Bridges even advised on how to rig buildings with explosives to target US Special Forces.In January 2021, Bridges recorded a video of himself in his US Army uniform, standing before an ISIS flag and making a gesture of support for the terrorist group. A week later, he sent another video in which he delivered a speech, using voice manipulation to conceal his identity.The FBI, along with several other military and intelligence agencies, was involved in the investigation.

Baloch human rights activist charged with terrorism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baloch-human-rights-activist-charged-with-terrorism/articleshow/114177775.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani police have registered a case against human rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch on the charge of aiding separatist groups in the country’s restive Balochistan province, officials said Saturday.

Their move came days after the killing of two Chinese engineers in a suicide blast in Karachi. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army had claimed responsibility.“To continue this, Mahrang Baloch has been brought to the forefront, who brings terrorists to the cities in the form of groups during her rallies,” read the police report.Baloch said the case against her aimed to threaten the collective struggle of Balochistan. “I will fight this in a court of law.”","Dr Mahrang Baloch accused of aiding separatist groups in restive Balochistan province.

As Hurricane Milton struck Florida, a fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico . The captain faced extreme conditions in the sea before finally being rescued by the US Coast Guard .The captain, whose name was not released, went out early at around 3 am on Wednesday to repair his broken boat ‘Captain Dave,’ as reported by the Washington Post.Around noon, the boat’s owner reported to the Coast Guard that the captain hadn’t checked in. “Watchstanders were able to make radio contact with the captain who reported the rudder was fouled with a line and became disabled during his transit back to port,” the US Coast Guard agency said in the release.The fishing vessel earlier in the week had broken down some 20 miles off John’s Pass in Pinellas County, and the captain and another crew member were rescued from it on Monday, but the vessel was left with salvage arrangements to be made.At that time, the Coast Guard reported winds of around 30 mph and waves reaching 6-8 feet. As conditions worsened with Hurricane Milton approaching, Coast Guard officials instructed the captain to wear alife jacket and keep the boat's emergency beacon close to ensure he could be located.However, by 6:45 pm, roughly two hours before Milton made landfall 20 miles south of John’s Pass, the Coast Guard lost contact with him. The Coast Guard launched a tedious search and rescue operation at around 5:30 am on Thursday, deploying airplane and helicopter crews.After a harrowing night of survival, the captain was found clinging to a cooler 30 miles off Longboat Key, around 1:30 pm on Thursday, more than 8 hours later after contact was lost.“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, the Coast Guard’s command center chief in St. Petersburg, Fla., said in a news release.The unnamed captain survived the extreme conditions in an incredibly dangerous situation. “He experienced the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot waves, for an extended period of time to include overnight,” Grady said in the release.“He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler,” Grady said.","A fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Milton struck Florida.

Like Epstein list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak off sessions, are doing the rounds on social media. The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Conservative commentator Benny Johnson led the charge, calling Obama’s comments “pure racist identity politics.” Johnson accused Obama of abandoning his previous message of unity, stating, “The magic is gone.This is the same guy who said, ‘There is not a white or Black America—there is only the United States of America!’ Now he’s running on racial supremacy? It’s grotesque.”Johnson's remarks were echoed by other conservative figures, including activist CJ Pearson, who took to social media to reaffirm his support for Trump. Pearson tweeted, “In 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young Black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! We don’t care what Barack Obama has to say about it.”Democratic Ohio state senator and former Bernie Sanders campaign advisor Nina Turner also criticized Obama, expressing her disappointment in his decision to single out Black men. Speaking on CNN, Turner said, “Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled?” While she acknowledged her “love” for Obama, she emphasized that many Black men have valid reasons for voting differently, and those choices should be respected, even if others disagree. Turner urged Democrats not to lay the blame for lower support for Harris solely on Black men, stressing the importance of appealing to all voters and addressing their concerns.Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump. The controversy has also fueled further attacks from Trump himself, who mocked Obama and Harris on Truth Social. Trump claimed that Obama ""lacked enthusiasm"" for Harris and suggested the former president might even vote for him, stating, “Obama can’t stand Low IQ Kamala Harris, so he’ll be voting for President Trump in 2024!”As the 2024 election approaches, this backlash reflects broader concerns within the Democratic Party about energizing voters, particularly among Black men, a crucial demographic that could influence the election outcome.","Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump.

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance , to church every week, saying that ""she didn't sign up for this."" Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife.“I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

"Donald Trump: 'An aggressive, offensive play': Why is Trump campaigning in California, a Democratic stronghold?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/an-aggressive-offensive-play-why-is-trump-campaigning-in-california-a-democratic-stronghold/articleshow/114175377.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump

With important battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in play, Donald Trump 's choice to visit California—a Democratic stronghold—just weeks before Election Day may seem questionable. However, despite his likely loss in the state, the former US president has strategic reasons for going to Coachella, a city east of Los Angeles.Trump, who lost California by a big margin in 2020, still secured over 6 million votes—more than any previous GOP candidate.His visit connects with a large group of supporters, which could help gather volunteers for phone banks and campaign efforts in key states.Tim Lineberger, former communications director for Trump’s 2016 Michigan campaign, explained the logic behind Trump’s move. “He’s coming here and activating this big population of Trump supporters,” said Lineberger, calling it “an aggressive, offensive play"", as quoted by the Associated Press.California is also a major source of campaign funds. Trump will be fundraising at the Coachella event, where photos with him are priced at $25,000, offering special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” is priced at $5,000.While Trump is unlikely to change the state’s outcome on November 5, the visit serves other purposes. California boasts the country’s second-largest media market in Los Angeles which will ensure extensive coverage. The rally is also seen as a “get-out-the-vote” effort for congressional races in the state, which could determine control of the House. Republican consultant Tim Rosales noted, “It’s a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energises Republicans in California.”Trump’s long-standing feud with California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom is expected to take centre stage. Newsom, who has frequently clashed with Trump, predicted the former president would denigrate the state while ignoring its strengths. “You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” Newsom said.Republican Party chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson wants to hear Trump explain how his agenda is different from that of the Democratic White House. She said, “The Democratic White House has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets.”While some believe Trump’s visit won't change California's strong Democratic support, others think he has bigger goals. Jim Brulte, former chairman of the state GOP, said Trump aims to achieve winning the popular vote. “There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.","Former US President Donald Trump will visit Coachella, a city east of Los Angeles.

Trump says he will use Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-use-alien-enemies-act-of-1798-to-deport-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/114175380.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington: Former US President and MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Friday said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal immigrants if he is elected to the White House. The rarely used law was last applied to corral immigrants of Japanese descent -- mostly US citizens -- in internment camps during World War Two.Ratcheting up his anti-immigrant rhetoric with falsehoods and hyperbole during a campaign event in Colorado, Trump directly blamed his opponent Kamala Harris , who is of Jamaican and Indian descent, for what he characterized as an ""invasion"" of the US by migrants resulting in rampart crimes, an allegation not borne out by government data at the federal or local level.“Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World,” Trump told raucous supporters in Aurora, a town he alleges has been overrun by Venezuelan gang members, a claim refuted by local officials, including Republicans. “I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered,” added, pledging that his administration will “get them the hell out of our country.”He followed up his pledge with a social media post saying, ""We are now known, all throughout the world, as OCCUPIED AMERICA... But to everyone here in Colorado and all across our nation, I make you this vow: November 5th, 2024 will be LIBERATION DAY in America.""Standing before signs that read “deport illegals now” and “end migrant crime,” at the rally, Trump said invoked the names of Americans who have been killed or mortally wounded ""at the hands of migrants who should never have been allowed into our Country,"" to announce that upon taking office, he will launch ""OPERATION AURORA at the Federal Level...to dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American Soil.""""No person who has inflicted the violence and terror that Kamala Harris has inflicted on this community can EVER be allowed to become President of the United States!"" he said.Colorado is a Democrat-leaning state where Trump has little change of winning. But he is expanding his outreach to blue states -- including New York and California -- ostensibly to rile up his base with bigger crowds in more populous states even as supporters in battleground states tire of his rhetoric. Polls suggest he has expanded his appeal in blue states among voters upset by Democrat misgovernance and radical left policies although he is well short of winning these states.Trump is now consistently distorting and misrepresenting data to make his case of an illegal immigrant ""invasion"" and migrant crime problem in America. While the US undoubtedly has a illegal immigration issue, the border crossing statistics that he cites, including claiming more than 21 million illegals coming in and 13,000 murderers on the loose, cover several administrations including his own.In some speeches he has suggested a Kamala presidency would let in 25 million illegal immigrants a year, fantastic numbers which would increase US population by 100 million, or 30 per cent in four years. ""You won't have a country left,"" he tells his supporters. Most recent data suggests that the US has around 12 million illegal immigrants -- a still considerable number even without exaggeration. They have come into the US over several administrations.In rallies on Friday, Trump said he would implement a 10-year prison sentence for migrants who re-enter the US after being deported and impose the death penalty on illegal migrants who kill American citizens, on top of “the largest deportation in American history” on his first day in office.Trump's hyper focus on illegal immigration comes amid polls showing he is losing his lead on the economy, with cooling inflation and a booming stock market helping Harris bridge the gap. “I know they do all these polls, and the polls say it’s the economy... and I can understand it a little bit. To me, it’s the horrible people that we’re allowing into our country that are destroying our country,” he said at a recent rally in Wisconsin.",Former US President and MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Friday said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal immigrants if he is elected to the White House.

US Republican vice-presidential nominee and Donald Trump 's running mate, JD Vance , has once again refused to acknowledge that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, dodging the question five times during an interview with the New York Times .In his conversation with Lulu Garcia-Navarro for 'The Interview' podcast, Ohio senator Vance repeated the response he used during his recent debate with Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz , saying, “There’s an obsession here with focusing on 2020.I’m much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable.”Vance's hesitation to say whether former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election matches the stance of his running mate. Trump, facing multiple charges related to his false claims of voter fraud, has consistently argued that the election was “stolen” from him. However, election officials, judges, and even Trump’s former attorney general have all debunked these allegations.During the hour-long interview, Garcia-Navarro pressed Vance repeatedly on the issue, asking whether Trump lost the 2020 election. Each time, Vance avoided the question, shifting the focus to his concerns about censorship by technology companies. He suggested that the suppression of stories related to Hunter Biden’s laptop on social media platforms had influenced the election outcome, costing Trump “millions of votes.”“I’ve answered your question with another question,” Vance responded when challenged. “You answer my question and I’ll answer yours.” When Garcia-Navarro pointed out that there was “no proof, legal or otherwise,” of election fraud, Vance dismissed the statement as “a slogan"", as quoted by the Associated Press.The vice-presidential nominee’s evasive responses during the interview were consistent with his debate performance earlier this month, where Walz criticised Vance for what he termed “a damning non-answer.”Vance later acknowledged that he wouldn't have certified the 2020 election results but assured that he would support a peaceful transfer of power in 2024 if any disputes arise.With the US Presidential election just a month away, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump are gearing up and making final preparations for the race ahead.","US Republican vice-presidential nominee and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, has once again refused to acknowledge that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election.

He suggested that the suppression of stories related to Hunter Biden’s laptop on social media platforms had influenced the election outcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114175133,imgsize-860583,width-400,resizemode-4/114175133.jpg"

The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shiites and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute. Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shiites dominate in parts of the district.Also Saturday, a separatist group in the southwest claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 21 people.The Baloch Liberation Army said its fighters targeted a coal mine in Duki district with heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades late Thursday night.It gave higher casualty figures of 30 dead and 18 injured.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution. Issues at home need to be solved before faking business as usual. Our only demand is let a doctor or sister meet Imran khan. That's all. It's completely illegal and unacceptable. And the world should know it,"" he said.The 23rd SCO summit has been scheduled to be held on October 15 and 16 and several leaders, including Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Iranian first vice president Reza Aref, Indian external affairs Minister S Jaishankar and other leaders from member states are expected to attend.The government has deployed more than 10,000 police and paramilitary personnel for the security of about 900 delegates coming to Islamabad. It also deployed army troops under Article 245 of the Constitution, to bolster security measures in Islamabad from October 5 to 17.The federal government has also announced a three-day holiday in the capital starting from October 14 to ensure the safety and protection of delegates attending the summit. The Punjab government has imposed Section 144 in the Rawalpindi district from October 10 to 17.",The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday. The government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician.
