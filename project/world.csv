NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday tore into Kolkata police for letting a 7,000-strong mob vandalise R G Kar hospital early on August 15, storm the resident doctors ' hostel and threaten female doctors with dire consequences if they opened their mouths about the rape-murder of their colleague.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra doubted the police's ability to protect the resident doctors, 90% of whom have left for their homes out of insecurity, and ordered deployment of CISF to guard the hospital and its hostels.""The protest by doctors (on August 15)... was part of the wider ' Reclaim the Night ' agitation. Police couldn't have been unaware of the fact that when there are protests across the country, another segment would try to disrupt the protests. Women doctors were assaulted (at RG Kar hospital). Police ran away from the scene. Thereafter the women doctors leading the protests were called out by name and threatened with the same fate that had befallen the rape-murder victim,"" the CJI said.Criticising police action against the agitators, SC said, ""Let not the power of the state be unleashed on peaceful protesters. Let's deal with them with sensitivity. This is a moment for national catharsis.""Senior advocate Aparajita Singh appearing for a doctor association ""Protect the Warriors"" informed the bench that of the 700-odd doctors and resident doctors working at R G Kar medical college and hospital at Kolkata, only 30-40 female doctors and 60-70 male doctors have stayed on the campus after the mob attack.""On August 14 night when the mob attacked the hospital, hoodlum entered the hostels and threatened the female doctors with the kind of threat that is given every time to protesting women,"" she said.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh appearing for a doctor association ""Protect the Warriors"" informed the bench that of the 700-odd doctors and resident doctors working at R G Kar medical college and hospital at Kolkata, only 30-40 female doctors and 60-70 male doctors have stayed on the campus after the mob attack.""On August 14 night when the mob attacked the hospital, hoodlum entered the hostels and threatened the female doctors with the kind of threat that is given every time to protesting women. They were threatened with very harsh consequences. Most of the women doctors have been called back by their families as they felt insecure. When the mob entered the hospital, the police ran away and hid in the changing rooms of nurses,"" she said.The CJI-led bench said, ""This is very serious. What was the police doing?"" For West Bengal, senior advocate Kapil Sibal agreed that it was a serious matter and informed that police have registered FIRs and taken 37 accused into custody. The court asked the Kolkata police to submit status report of its investigations into the August 14-15 night vandalism by August 22.CJI was not satisfied with Sibal's assurance that action will be taken against all the accused. ""The question is what were the police doing?"" Sibal said, ""There were 150 policemen deployed outside the hospital. A mob of 7,000 people came. By the time we got additional police force, this vandalism took place. This is what happened. I will show you the video.""Justice Pardiwala said, ""We just made a fervent appeal to the doctors to join duty. Even if we ask the state to give police protection, is this police force going to protect them? At the R G Kar medical hospital, obviously the female doctors left because of insecurity. If these doctors are to resume duty and they are to be safeguarded, who is going to provide security for them?"" SG suggested the security to be handed over to central forces like CISF and CRPF.SC in its order said, ""To create safe condition for the doctors to return to duty, not only to pursue their own education but to administer medical care to patients, the court has been assured by the SG that CISF/CRPF shall be deployed in sufficient numbers to guard the facilities of RG Kar medical hospital including the hostels where they stay.

NEW DELHI: Taking suo motu cognisance of the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar college, the Supreme Court on Tuesday came down heavily on the West Bengal government and police as it raised serious concerns over the handling of the matter.The top court rapped the Mamata Banerjee-led state government over several aspects of the case, saying it could not ""comprehend"" how certain events unfolded in the wake of the ghastly crime that has ""shocked the conscience"" of the nation.The Supreme Court raised five big questions on the West Bengal government in the backdrop of the case that included filing of an FIR, action taken against college principal, vandalism in the proximity to the crime scene, the initial suicide angle and delay in allowing the parents to see the body.The Supreme Court questioned Bengal government over delay in filing FIR in the case and asked what were hospital authorities doing.""We don't understand why FIR was registered after 12 hours,"" the bench said.Supreme Court slammed the state's shoddy action against college principal Dr Sandip Ghosh, asking when conduct of principal was ""under scrutiny, how was he appointed to another college immediately"".Ghosh resigned from the position of RG Kar Principal on August 12.

NEW DELHI: After two nursery students, four-year-old girls, were sexually abused by the sweeper of a reputed school in Thane district, protests erupted at Badlapur railway station on Tuesday where local trains were stopped and agitators blocked the tracks.Read more: Maharashtra Kids Sex Abuse Live Updates: CPRO Central Railway said, ""Local trains stopped at Badlapur railway station where protesters agitated against the alleged sexual assault incident with two minor girls at a school in Badlapur.""More than four hours have passed since the protesters descended on tracks but police and authorities are unable to convince protesters who refused to heed pleas for the withdrawal of the blockade.A call for Badlapur bandh has been given by several organisations to protest against the incident.Residents in Badlapur protested against the sexual abuse of two minor girls which occurred last week. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The parents came to know about the incident on August 18 and filed anFIR .Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. The 24-year-old accused was arrested on Saturday, but the parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. They claimed that the FIR was registered more than 12 hours after the complaint was lodged, and only after the intervention of the District Women and Child Welfare Department.The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher , and female attendant, holding them responsible for the incident.The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper, who was hired on August 1, to accompany the young girls to the washroom. The incident came to light when one of the girls confided in her grandfather about the sexual abuse by the school staff member when he would take her and her friend to the washroom. The family then discussed the matter with the other girl's parents, who revealed that their daughter had recently become afraid to go to school.The families took the four-year-olds for a medical check-up with a private doctor, who confirmed that the girls had been sexually abused. They then approached a local MNS leader who accompanied them to the police station on Friday at 12.30 pm. However, instead of promptly recording the parents' statements and registering an FIR, the police station in-charge, Shubhada Shitole, allegedly made them wait for hours, stating that they needed to verify the claim first. Sources claimed that a police team visited the school but were informed that the CCTV cameras had not been functioning for the past few days.It was only after the District Women and Child Welfare Department intervened, police registered a case under the Pocso Act past midnight. On Saturday morning, police also got the girls’ medical examination conducted at a govt hospital as a private medical test is not valid in court.The police station incharge, Subhada Shitole, has been transferred to the special branch by Thane police for delaying the registration of the FIR when the parents of the child approached the police station.Locals said that along with citizens, rickshaw union, traders’ union, jewellers association, and now some political parties have also come forward to join the bandh. The accused, who was hired by the school on August 1, will remain in police remand until August 21.Rajya Sabha MP from UBT Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi expressed her deep concern and condemned the incident.""Two young girls were sexually assaulted in Badlapur, Maharashtra in the school premises; the entire state is outraged and seeks justice. I once again urge the President to approve the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, so that no other child or woman faces this travesty. Shame on the state government to continue to ignore the safety of women,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded a fast-track trial and speedy justice in the case of sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Thane district. Talking to reporters, Thackeray said on one hand, the Mahayuti government is running the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme for women, but daughters of sisters are not safe.In an apparent reference to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, where the Mamata Banerjee-led government has come under fire, the Sena (UBT) chief said politics was being done over crime against women by targeting certain states.The former chief minister claimed the school where the girls were allegedly sexually abused was linked to BJP leaders. ""The case should be fast-tracked, and the victims should be ensured speedy justice,"" he said.Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties like Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT), besides Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, attacked the government on the incident in the home district of chief minister Eknath Shinde.Nationalist Congress Party (SP) working president Supriya Sule said the incident is “very shocking and serious” and the state home department must take note of the citizens’ anger.“Citizens are demanding strict action against the murderer who committed this heinous act. The anger of the citizens is very right and the home department needs to take note of their anger,” urged Sule.She called upon the Thane Police to thoroughly investigate the (accused) person and take strict action against him.“Apart from this, a case should also be registered against the management of the institution who tried to suppress this matter,” demanded Sule.Congress leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar called up Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare and demanded the suspension of the woman police official who reportedly made the victim’s parents sit in the police station for nearly 12 hours before taking their complaint last week.“This case must be taken up by a fast track court to hear it in three months and the accused must be given the death sentence,” said Wadettiwar.Congress MP and Mumbai president Varsha Gaikwad said, “The incident of inhumane and cruel treatment of the girls is mind-numbing”, and the issue of women’s safety has become very serious during the Shinde government, while its silence was unbearable.“The number of crimes against women is also increasing, but the state Home Minister and the government are not at all concerned. It is not enough to simply say 'Ladaki Baheen' and sit with rakhi in hand. If the government wants to preserve the true relationship with the sisters, it also has to fulfil the responsibility of keeping them safe as a true brother,” pointed out Gaikwad.SS (UBT)’s Deputy Leader Sushma Andhare questioned why schools without CCTVs and ‘sevikas’ (women assistants) were given permission and said “Ladki Bahin can wait, we need ‘Surakshit Bahin’ (secure sister) first”.Claiming that there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state, SS (UBT)’s spokesperson Kishore Tiwari demanded the immediate sacking of deputy CM Fadnavis and forming an SIT to probe the shocking case.“The law and order does not exist due to corruption and cash deals to get desired police postings… The CM is like a rubber stamp as there's a complete collapse of law and order due to hostile corruption and cash and getting the desired posting. The BJP is responsible for the present messy situation,” said Tiwari.Demanding the resignation of both the CM and deputy CM, VBA Chief Spokesperson Siddharth Mokle said the incident is a blot on humanity but the government is only obsessed about winning the next elections at all costs.The Maharashtra government on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sexual abuse of two girl students of a school in Badlapur. The SIT will be headed by Inspector General of Police-rank officer Aarti Singh, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who heads the home department, stated on X.Fadnavis stated he has directed the Thane Police Commissioner to prepare a proposal to try the case in a fast-track court.Maharashtra government ordered the suspension of three police officials, including a senior inspector, for alleged dereliction of duty in the investigation of the sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Badlapur, amid widespread protests.""The orders of immediate suspension of the senior police inspector, assistant sub-inspector and head constable attached to Badlapur police station for the dereliction of duty have been issued,"" deputy chief minister and home minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.Fadnavis said the state government has appointed Arti Singh, an inspector general-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to conduct the inquiry.""It will be our endeavour to inquire into the incident at the earliest. We want to file the chargesheet in this case as soon as possible and place the matter before a fast-track court for hearing,"" he said.""Our police department will make complete efforts to get such a barbaric and inhuman act punished immediately,"" the deputy chief minister added.He slammed the Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) working president, Supriya Sule, and former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly politicising the issue.""It is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to gain political benefit out of such incidents. The opposition is devoid of any empathy. The politics of the opposition is coming to the fore,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.He said Thackeray should behave like a statesman and not stoop too low and indulge in politics on a sensitive issue of sexual abuse.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has directed the police to invoke the attempt to rape charge against the arrested accused. The case will be fast-tracked and a special public prosecutor will be appointed, Shinde said on Tuesday.""I have spoken to the Thane Commissioner of Police. The accused has been arrested. I have asked the case to be fast-tracked and book the accused under the charges of attempt to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" he said.The chief minister warned of legal action if the management of the school is found negligent or complicit, the chief minister's office (CMO) stated.During a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar, Shinde proposed several measures aimed at improving school safety and preventing future abuse like the installation of complaint boxes in every school, enhancing scrutiny of school staff who frequently interact with students, including the background checks, and establishing safe reporting mechanisms for students.Shinde appealed to demonstrating parents to exercise restraint as the rail blockade was hampering the functioning of local trains.Maharashtra education minister Deepak Kesarkar said, ""We will see to it that the existing safety measures are further strengthened. We are issuing a circular today that CCTVs must be operational in each school. We will appoint a committee based on the Vishaka committee in schools as well. We will fast-track this case and give the strictest punishment to the accused. The school principal, the class teacher and 2 assistants have been suspended. The school also has been served a notice. A woman senior PI who delayed registering a case has been transferred but she should be suspended.""""This is a very sad incident. The entire machinery of the state education department has been mobilized. We have given instructions to four IAS officers from Pune and Mumbai. We are investigating why the CCTV was not functioning in the school. After the complaint was lodged, no action was taken, so the Senior PI has been transferred. We will bring this case to a Fast Track court and ensure the maximum punishment for the accused. Our entire department is present here, and the safety of students is our priority,"" he added.Meanwhile, a BJP MLA from the Murbad assembly constituency in Thane district, Kisan Kathore, alleged the protest at Badlapur railway station is politically motivated. He claimed agitators have come from neighbouring areas and not from Badlapur.""These demonstrators are not from Badlapur city; they have arrived from neighbouring areas such as Ulhasnagar. A comprehensive investigation is conducted against the school principal and staff members who allegedly attempted to suppress the incident,"" Kathore said.He alleged some individuals associated with political parties had put up banners in Badlapur rejecting the funds offered under the ""Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana"", but are now seeking justice. ""The protesters at Badlapur station are not locals. They are residents of neighbouring areas,"" he added.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday demanded a detailed report from Maharashtra authorities on the incident of alleged sexual assault on two four-year-old girls in a school washroom in Thane district and the ""delay"" in filing an FIR in the matter. The Commission took suo motu cognisance of the case on a day thousands of protesters blocked railway tracks at Badlapur station in Thane and stormed the local school building, where the alleged incident had occurred.The accused, who was employed to clean the girls' toilets, is alleged to have victimised the children on August 12-13, 2024.The NHRC has issued notices to the chief secretary and the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, demanding a detailed report on the incident within two weeks.The Commission's directive calls for clarity on the reasons behind the reported ""12-hour delay"" in registering the First Information Report (FIR) after the parents lodged a complaint with the police.Parents of the victims have raised concerns over why a female staff member was not assigned to clean the girls' washroom, a standard practice that could have potentially prevented such an incident.The Commission has emphasised the need to investigate this aspect thoroughly.In addition to the status of the FIR, the NHRC has requested details about the health and well-being of the two victims, including whether they have received any counselling or support services from the authorities or the school management.The NHRC has also asked for information on the measures being taken or proposed to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will dispatch a team to Thane in Maharashtra following the alleged sexual assault of a four-year-old girl in a school in the district. The apex child rights body has also questioned the delay in the registration of an FIR in the matter. The incident has sparked outrage, particularly due to a reported delay by the local police in lodging the First Information Report (FIR).NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo took to social media to express his distress over the incident and announced that a team would be dispatched to investigate the matter.He questioned why police made the victim's parents wait for 12 hours to get an FIR lodged.""I will personally monitor the investigation, and ensure that all negligent police officers are punished,"" Kanoongo said in a post on X.A woman journalist covering the protest over the Badlapur sexual abuse incident alleged on Tuesday that a local leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena made an offensive remark, saying she was acting 'as if she herself had been raped.'Waman Mhatre, former mayor of Badlapur who belongs to the party led by the Maharashtra chief minister, however, claimed that his remark was misconstrued.The woman journalist, who works for a Marathi daily, told a news channel that as she was covering the protests on the tracks, Mhatre confronted her, making 'vulgar' gestures. She was reporting on the incident in such a way 'as if she herself had been raped,' she quoted Mhatre as saying.""Such behavior was highly unacceptable and caused me agony. However, I responded by asserting that my reporting is based on facts,"" the woman added.Mhatre claimed that his comments were misconstrued. ""I was insisting that they provide factual information to the protesters. The word 'rape' was consistently used. I was asking them to get factual information, but it was misconstrued,"" he said.The Mumbai Press Club condemned Mhatre's statements and demanded that chief minister Shinde take action against him. Mhatre ""demonstrated blatant disregard for public sentiment by blaming journalists for the incident"" and asserted that the media was inciting unrest, the Press Club said in a statement.",Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper to accompany the young girls to the washroom.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112647326,imgsize-80076,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112647326.jpg"
Kolkata doctor death: Who is Sanjay Roy? Civic volunteer arrested in RG Kar Hospital rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-doctor-death-who-is-sanjay-roy-civic-volunteer-arrested-in-rg-kar-hospital-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112440685.cms,"Sanjay Roy (In middle) was taken into custody on Saturday

Who is Sanjay Roy?

Roy joined Kolkata Police’s Disaster Management Group as a civic volunteer in 2019 but used “the right channels” to shift to Kolkata Police’s Welfare Cell.

He reportedly used “connections” to live on the premises of KP’s 4th Battalion. This association helped him get posted at RG Kar Hospital.

Hospital. Roy had been assigned to the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital on several occasions, sometimes for extended periods, granting him easy access to all hospital departments.

What are his position and entitlements?

It has come to light that Roy is a member of the Police Welfare Board’s 14-member central committee, and his 'disapproval' could lead to the transfer of police officers.

Roy received 5 liters of free fuel daily to use a police motorcycle for personal purposes. The motorcycle, which had a police sticker, was seized on Monday.

The bike Sanjay Roy used to ride had a police sticker on it

What are the allegations against him?

A police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women.

He was found guilty on at least two occasions—first for assaulting his pregnant wife in 2022, and later for misbehaving with a female doctor a few weeks ago—but he was never censured. He managed to evade capture even after assaulting his pregnant wife.

On Monday, a woman went to Lalbazar to report that Roy had been harassing her by phone for the past three months. He first approached her at RG Kar Hospital under the pretext of buying medicine, obtained her number from the prescription, and has since pressured and threatened her to meet.

Another complaint against Roy concerns police transfers. An officer suspects that his significant “influence” may have played an active role in at least six transfers from the Tala police station and Shyambazar police outpost in recent weeks.

What practices is Sanjay Roy known for?

Being part of a tout racket operating out of the hospital. Charged money, promising cash-strapped relatives of patients admission at R G Kar Hospital for a fee.

Charging bribe for free or services at discounts at the hospital — like beds and various tests.

Promising admission of patients at nearby nursing homes for a fee in case they don’t get admission at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital.

discovered in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building, where the young doctor's body was found on Friday, led to his identification. CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.

What happened at RG Kar on Friday?

Post-midnight, deceased doctor and four colleagues ordered food and had dinner in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver.

After the meal, her colleagues departed, and she remained in the room to continue her studies. She handed over her duties to colleagues, and went to the seminar hall to study. At around 2 am, someone from the hospital visited her in the seminar hall to discuss a patient’s treatment.

Police said that around the same time, she had received a message from her cousin and replied at 2.35 am, saying everything was ""normal"" till then. Before 3 am, a hospital staff member found her lying under a red blanket in the seminar hall. It is assumed that the accused, Sanjay, entered the seminar hall after that.

At 3am, she was seen sleeping in the room.

Around 4am, the accused entered the seminar room, sexually assaulted her. When she attempted to resist, the perpetrator throttled her.

The woman's broken glasses were found next to her laptop, suggesting that she fought her attacker for a considerable time, trying to defend herself.

Her eyes had blood clots from being throttled. Reports indicate that the accused covered her mouth forcefully and slammed her head against the wall, causing injuries to her face. While her thyroid cartilage was not fractured, it did have a blood clot, suggesting the attacker pressed hard to prevent her from escaping. Nail marks on her face indicate she tried to scream but was silenced.

The next morning, when her body was found at 7.30am, her mask was discovered a short distance away. A closed laptop was found near her head, with a diary and her mobile phone placed on top of it. A plastic water bottle was found overturned next to her head.

What is the sequence of events?

9.30 am: The Assistant Superintendent calls the victim’s parents and reports the incident as a suicide.

10.10 am: The Inspector-in-Charge of the R.G. Kar police outpost is alerted.

10.30 am: Tala Police Station sends an alert to CP, DCP, JCP, and addl CP.

11.30 am: Police officers up to the rank of additional CP arrive at the scene.

1.00 pm: The victim’s parents arrive, and a forensic team examines the seminar room, the crime scene. The parents claim they are initially denied access.

1.10 pm: The parents are granted access to the seminar room. Students identify the body, and a cloth partition is put up.

3.55 pm: The victim’s father requests an inquest by a judicial magistrate.

4.20 pm: The judicial magistrate arrives, conducts a videographed inquest, and the woman’s mother signs the inquest report.

5.30 pm: The body is taken out for an autopsy.

6.10 pm to 7.10 pm: The autopsy is completed.

What does the autopsy say?

The official postmortem report late on Friday also confirmed sexual assault on the 31-year-old doctor.

on the 31-year-old doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

What are recent developments in CBI investigation into Sanjay Roy?

Hours after the CBI registered an FIR in the RG Kar rape-murder case in New Delhi, the agency took custody of the prime accused, Sanjay Roy. He was subjected to a medical examination and began questioning at the CBI's CGO Complex office.

The process was marked by considerable drama. When CBI officials attempted to transport Roy for his medical check-up at ESI Joka in the afternoon, they encountered difficulties. The prison van had to turn back midway due to ongoing protests by doctors at ESI Joka, which posed a safety concern. Roy was initially taken to Command Hospital, but they were unable to conduct the examination there. The examination was eventually completed at BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah.

On Thursday, the victim’s parents informed the CBI that they suspected Sanjay Roy was not the primary perpetrator but was acting under the influence of others. They expressed their belief that the case involved gang rape and alleged a deliberate attempt to cover up the crime by hospital authorities.

On Monday, the CBI received approval to conduct a polygraph test on the arrested civic volunteer , Sanjay Roy.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

Villagers thwart bulldozers out to raze houses in south Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/villagers-thwart-bulldozers-out-to-raze-houses-in-south-delhi/articleshow/112635348.cms,"The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living there, who claim to be the third and fourth generations of stone mine labourers

NEW DELHI: The festive mood of Raksha Bandhan petered out rapidly at Rajokri village near Vasant Kunj on Monday morning when bulldozers arrived to demolish the houses. But the residents thwarted the exercise, blocking the entry to the village with a truck. The residents' association is now busy pulling out old documents and doing the paperwork to get a stay on the demolitions from Delhi High Court .The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living amid old mining pits. The families claim to be the third and fourth generations of stone mine labourers who once worked there. They also claim to be living in the area for over three decades.Residents said forest officials, accompanied by police and power officials, reached the clusters of Ramdev Ka Dera, Chameli Ka Dera and Keval Krishna Ka Dera, named after the contractors who brought the to work the mines as far back as 1964, with bulldozers on Monday morning, an action they had been anticipating after receiving demolition notices on Aug 9 and 14. The locals, while asserting that they had the right to rehabilitation as per DUSIB norms , alleged that the forest department hadn't given them enough time to explore legal options.""After receiving the first notice at Ramdev Ka Dera on Aug 9, we have been apprehensive,"" said Rajendra Kumar, who works as a driver for a south Delhi family. ""I am the third generation of my family living here after my grandfather came as a labourer from Rajasthan in 1967. We have valid documents, power connection and water supply, yet are being thrown out.""The area also has a DUSIB community centre, proper roads, electric poles and piped water through two tubewells. Delhi Jal Board tankers also supply drinking water in the region because, the residents say, the groundwater is often undrinkable.After the stone mines closed, the hamlet was designated a gram sabha. However, in 1996, the area was declared forest land and part of the Ridge. In 2013, the Sonya Ghosh Vs GNCT Delhi case began and in Jan 2021, the National Green Tribunal directed Delhi govt to take measures to protect the Ridge, including clearance of encroached areas.""These clusters are among the oldest of the 675 slums enlisted under the DUSIB Act, 2010. Under that Act, houses built before 2006 can't be removed without the residents being rehabilitated,"" said activist Prakash Kumar. ""A rehab plan, a must under DUSIB norms, hasn't been prepared or shared with the Rajokri residents. So how can the forest department carry out demolitions?""Forest officials did not offer any comment on the matter. On Aug 8, the West forest division listed khasra numbers and asked the people occupying these plots to vacate them within seven days. The notice claimed the plots comprised notified reserve forest land and the houses were encroachments under the Indian Forest Act, 1927.""The forest department wants us to vacate this area but isn't interested in rehabilitating people who lose their homes,"" complained Tuntun Kumar, a union member who is in the team exploring legal options. ""They call us encroachers, which we are not. We have papers for the land; there are records that we paid for the land block.""Sher Singh, who traces his roots to Rajasthan, said, ""Our ancestors came from UP, Bihar, Rajasthan and Haryana, but we don't have villages to go back to after so many decades. Rajokri is our village where we have our temple and crematorium. Where can we go?""","The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living there.

Prince William’s 'irritation' revealed in latest royal dispute: Harry and Meghan’s ‘Kate’ insult hits a nerve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-williams-irritation-revealed-in-latest-royal-dispute-harry-and-meghans-kate-insult-hits-a-nerve/articleshow/112666593.cms,"Kate Middleton’s preference for ‘Catherine’

Brothers’ rift and future reconciliation

Friends of Prince William and Kate Middleton have reportedly said that the Prince of Wales is ""irritated"" by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s decision to refer to his wife as ‘Kate’ rather than her preferred name, ‘ Catherine ,’ according to the Daily Beast.The reported annoyance stems from a public statement made by Harry and Meghan in March 2024, after Kate disclosed her illness.The statement read, “We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.” William’s friends suggest that this choice of name was perceived as a deliberate slight, given that Kate has chosen to be known as Catherine in formal and personal contexts.One friend was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “William takes offense at people calling Catherine ‘Kate,’ because she has asked to be known as Catherine. It’s a fairly simple wish to respect. I’m sure Meghan wouldn’t like it if William started publicly calling her ‘Meghan Markle.’”Kate Middleton has long preferred to be addressed as Catherine, a choice respected by her close circle and Prince William. Although she was widely known as Kate in her early years, she opted to use her full name, Catherine, before her marriage. This preference extends to official and social settings, despite continued media references to her as Kate Middleton, particularly in the US.The friend continued, “It’s an utterly trivial thing, but those of us who know William know that it is one of the things that pushes his buttons. Pushing his buttons while he was going through his wife’s cancer seemed an entirely unnecessary and deliberate irritation.”Another close friend of the Waleses added, “No one’s saying it’s responsible for all the trouble, but deliberately calling someone by a name they don’t like is just bloody rude. If Harry and Meghan were serious about healing their issue, a good first step would be to call her Catherine.”The ongoing rift between William and Harry continues to garner attention. A friend of William’s told the UK Sunday Times that the brothers' estrangement is ""dreadfully sad,"" while royal author Christopher Andersen expressed hope for reconciliation. Andersen suggested that despite the tensions, William might eventually extend an olive branch to Harry, even including him in his coronation.As the royal family navigates these strained relationships, the use of names and titles remains a sensitive issue, reflecting deeper undercurrents of personal and public diplomacy.","Friends of Prince William and Kate Middleton have reportedly said that the Prince of Wales is ""irritated"" by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to refer to his wife as ‘Kate’ rather than her preferred name, ‘ Catherine.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112667894,imgsize-1313489,width-400,resizemode-4/112667894.jpg"

However, the formal FIR was not lodged until 11.45pm, nearly eight-and-a-half hours later - more than three hours after the body had already been handed over to the family for cremation at 8.30pm.The case has sparked scrutiny, with Kolkata police under pressure to explain the procedural delay in handling the 31-year-old doctor's rape and murder.Documents from court proceedings and interviews with police officers revealed that assistant professor Sumit Kumar Tapadar notified police at 9.45am about the discovery of the body in a ""seminar room"" and urged them to file an FIR. However, police received the official written complaint from hospital authorities at 2.45pm.The police timeline showed they were informed of the death at 10.10am and arrived at the scene by 10.30am. Kolkata police's homicide squad reached the location by 11am, followed by senior officers by 12.30pm. By 12.45pm, an ""unnatural death"" (UD) case was registered.The victim's father criticised the delay. ""We told everyone it was a case of murder after seeing the body around 3pm. We lodged our complaint around 5 or 5.30pm. But the FIR was formally registered hours later. Only the police know why,"" he said Tuesday.During a Supreme Court hearing, Chief Justice DY Chandrachud addressed the delay. ""It is the obligation of the hospital authorities to file an FIR immediately after such an incident occurs, regardless of whether the parents were present,"" he said.According to senior criminal lawyer Milon Mukherjee, it was legally permissible for police to first lodge an UD case, as they had not yet determined whether the cause of death was suicidal, homicidal, or accidental. ""However, once the autopsy determined murder, particularly, in the RG Kar case, police could have suo motu registered an FIR under specific sections of the new law dealing with murder,"" he said.Fellow criminal lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said a UD case is typically registered when the cause of death is unclear, but all signs in this case pointed to murder.Senior police officers defended the delay. A Kolkata police officer said: ""The UD case allowed us to begin our investigation, including inquest, seizure, and autopsy. The delay in filing the formal FIR was due to officers being occupied with law and order duties. When the officer in charge returned to the station, the FIR was filed in accordance with Section 111 of the Police Regulations, Calcutta, 1968.""",Kolkata police under pressure to explain procedural delay in handling doctor's rape and murder.

"US elections: Tim Walz describes family's IVF journey, wife says it was different procedure; scrutiny follows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-tim-walz-describes-familys-ivf-journey-wife-says-it-was-different-procedure-scrutiny-follows/articleshow/112666594.cms,"In a bid to connect with voters amid rising concerns over reproductive rights , Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has placed his family's fertility struggles at the forefront of his narrative as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' running mate. However, recent revelations have sparked controversy and criticism.In March, following an Alabama court ruling that halted in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in the state, Walz publicly shared his family's struggles to have children.His campaign even sent out a fundraising email titled ""Our IVF Journey,"" with a reference to ""his family's IVF journey"" in the headline. Walz later took aim at Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, declaring, ""If it was up to him, I wouldn't have a family because of IVF.""However, earlier this week, Gwen Walz, the governor's wife, issued a statement clarifying their experience, revealing that they relied on intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) rather than IVF. Gwen's statement offered a more comprehensive account of their journey, stating, ""Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time – not even sharing the details with our wonderful and close family.""IUI, which is often attempted before IVF, does not face the same level of political scrutiny because it does not involve the risk of destroying unused embryos—a key point of contention for anti-abortion advocates. Gwen Walz shared that she was supported by a nurse who assisted her with the shots required for the IUI process.In response to the controversy, Mia Ehrenberg, a campaign spokesperson for Walz, defended his comments, saying, ""Governor Walz talks how normal people talk. He was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.""Despite the clarification, JD Vance seized on the opportunity to brand Walz a liar, taking to social media to criticize him: ""Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF. Who lies about something like that?""The disagreement over such a deeply personal issue has come as Republicans seek to undermine Walz's biography. This scrutiny follows similar criticism over how he has characterized his military service, which his supporters dismiss as politically motivated attacks.The controversy comes at a time when reproductive rights are a central issue in American politics. The Alabama Supreme Court's February ruling that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law temporarily halted IVF procedures, sparking outrage among those attempting to become parents.During his State of the State address in March, Walz did not explicitly state that his wife underwent IVF, but he described the Alabama ruling as a ""direct attack on my children,"" expressing the emotional toll it took on his family.Experts in the field of reproductive health have noted that confusion between IUI and IVF is common among patients. Dr. Jason Griffith of Shady Grove Fertility-Houston and Dr John Storment of Lafayette, Louisiana, both highlighted the differences between the two procedures, with Storment emphasizing that IUI is unlikely to face the same level of political threat as IVF.Advocates like Mini Timmaraju, head of Reproductive Freedom for All, argue that the Walz family's story brings a human element to the broader discussion on reproductive rights. Meanwhile, critics, including Rachel Aplikowski of the Minnesota Senate Republican Caucus, have called for Walz to apologize for what they view as an exaggeration of their struggles.","Minnesota Gov.

Former President John F Kennedy’s grandson takes the stage at DNC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jack-schlossberg-former-president-john-f-kennedys-grandson-to-take-the-stage-at-dnc/articleshow/112666595.cms,"Jack Schlossberg , the grandson of former President John F Kennedy, addressed the Democratic National Convention (DNC) today, drawing a parallel between Vice President Kamala Harris and his grandfather.Schlossberg, a Democratic delegate for New York, has steadily become a prominent figure within the Democratic Party , continuing his family’s tradition of political engagement.Schlossberg, 31, is the son of Caroline Kennedy , the US Ambassador to Australia, and has been increasingly active in political circles, despite saying that he has no immediate plans to run for office, reported the Hill.In his speech, Schlossberg highlighted the connection between Harris and Kennedy, saying, “Like President Kennedy, Vice President Harris has dedicated her life to public service. She believes in America like my grandfather did — that we do things not because they’re easy, but because they’re hard.”He referred to Kennedy’s iconic 1962 speech on the American space effort, emphasizing that the ideals his grandfather championed remain relevant today.“The torch has been passed to a new generation of leader who shares my grandfather’s energy, vision, and optimism for our future—that leader is Vice President Kamala Harris,” Schlossberg said, calling Kennedy his “hero.”Schlossberg, who has gained a substantial following on social media through his discussions on politics and comedic sketches, is expected to bring a youthful perspective to the convention. Earlier this year, he shared with Vogue, “As I’ve grown up, I’ve become more involved in the official obligations that come with being part of my family. I’ve met a lot of politicians and become all the more optimistic about our future by doing that work.”A Yale University graduate with a degree in history, Schlossberg furthered his education at Harvard, earning both a JD and an MBA. Following the path of several relatives, he passed the New York State Bar Exam last year, adding legal credentials to his growing portfolio.This summer, Schlossberg took on the role of political correspondent for Vogue, where he is covering the 2024 election.His rising profile in the political arena was also highlighted last year when he publicly criticized his cousin Robert F Kennedy Jr's independent presidential campaign and endorsed President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. Following Biden’s withdrawal, Schlossberg has since thrown his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, as reported by Business Insider.As the youngest of Kennedy’s three children, Schlossberg continues to uphold the legacy of one of America’s most iconic political families, contributing to the ongoing narrative of the Kennedy dynasty in modern politics.","Jack Schlossberg, 31, is the son of Caroline Kennedy, the US Ambassador to Australia.

Justice Hema report ignites controversy: Demand for investigative action in malayalam cinema grows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/justice-hema-report-ignites-controversy-demand-for-investigative-action-in-malayalam-cinema-grows/articleshow/112667689.cms,"There were increasing demands for a special investigation into exploitation and rights violations within the Malayalam film industry, highlighted by the Justice K Hema Committee report.

‘Involving an agency like CBI would be appropriate’

KOCHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The call for a special investigation team is gaining momentum in response to allegations of exploitation and rights violation of women in Malayalam film industry as revealed in the Justice K Hema Committee report.Besides opposition parties, many in the legal fraternity have criticised the state govt for sitting on the committee report for nearly five years.""The state govt should take steps to constitute a special team to investigate these allegations, including sexual harassment in cinema industry,"" former director general of prosecution T A Asaf Ali said.CM Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, said the govt would take appropriate legal action if any woman who testified before the committee filed a complaint. He refuted allegations that the govt had kept the committee report in cold storage.Former DGP Asaf Ali said involving a national agency like CBI would be more appropriate as certain allegations revealed in the Justice HemaCommittee report had inter-state ramifications.As per Section 173 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), any information related to the commission of a cognizable offence, regardless of where the offence is committed, can be investigated by police.Claiming that the govt had not sat on the committee report, CM Pinarayi Vijayan said Justice Hema herself had written to the govt back in 2020, requesting that the report should not be released as it contained references affecting the privacy of many individuals. He also said the information commission had earlier ruled that it was impractical to release the report while ensuring confidentiality.“The govt has consistently stated that it has no objection to releasing the report,” he said.The Justice Hema Committee report had primarily documented incidents of sexual harassment on cinema sets and 'casting couch' during auditions.Upon receiving this information, police are obligated to investigate the allegations using the victims’ statements recorded by the committee. The state and police are responsible for a thorough investigation of such claims.The committee had gathered various forms of evidence, including audio and video recordings, WhatsApp message screenshots and chat logs. An investigation team can review this material to support its probe.The Allegations: The committee report highlighted several allegations, including sexual demands made to women for entry into cinema industry and sexual harassment at workplaces, during transportation and accommodation.It also mentioned torture of women, violation of human rights by denying basic facilities, making demeaning and vulgar comments and cyber-attacks.Police can address these issues by taking cognizance of these allegations. Furthermore, the report demanded that the state should address issues like gender-based pay disparity and non-execution of contracts.What The Law Says: As per Section 173 of BNSS, upon receipt of information related to the commission of any cognizable offence punishable by imprisonment for three years or more but less than seven years, the officer-in-charge of the police station may, with prior permission from an officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police and considering the nature and gravity of the offence, either proceed to conduct a preliminary inquiry within 14 days to ascertain whether a prima facie case exists or proceed with the investigation if a prima facie case is established.Similarly, the allegations outlined in the report could constitute the offence of assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a woman's modesty, under Section 354 of the IPC (Section 74 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita).As per this section, anyone who assaults or uses criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty shall be punished with imprisonment for up to five years and may also be liable to a fine.","There are increasing demands for a special investigation into exploitation and rights violations within the Malayalam film industry, highlighted by the Justice K Hema Committee report.

The right-wing groups of families, who oppose a cease-fire deal , said Netanyahu told them Israel will not abandon two strategic corridors in Gaza whose control by Israel has been an obstacle in talks. Netanyahu's office did not comment on their account.The meeting came as Israel's military said it recovered the bodies of six hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that started the war, bringing fresh grief for many Israelis who have long pressed Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire that would bring remaining hostages home.Blinken's meetings in Egypt and upcoming ones in Qatar come a day after he met Netanyahu and said the prime minister had accepted a US proposal to bridge gaps separating Israel and Hamas. Blinken called on the militant group to do the same. But there still appear to be wide gaps between the two sides.Pressure to seal a cease-fire deal has been especially urgent after the recent targeted killings of militant leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah in Iran and Lebanon, both blamed on Israel, and vows of retaliation that have sparked fears of a wider regional war.Israel's military said its forces recovered the six bodies in an overnight operation in southern Gaza, without saying when or how they died. Hamas says some captives have been killed and wounded in Israeli airstrikes, though returning hostages have talked about difficult conditions including lack of food or medications.The recovery of the remains is also a blow to Hamas, which hopes to exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an Israeli withdrawal and a lasting cease-fire.The military said it had identified the remains of Chaim Perry, 80; Yoram Metzger, 80; Avraham Munder, 79; Alexander Dancyg, 76; Nadav Popplewell, 51; and Yagev Buchshtav, 35. Metzger, Munder, Popplewell and Buchshtav had family members who were abducted but freed during a November cease-fire.Munder's death was confirmed by Kibbutz Nir Oz, the farming community where he was among around 80 residents seized. It said he died after ""months of physical and mental torture."" Israeli authorities previously determined the other five were dead.Netanyahu said ""our hearts ache for the terrible loss."" There were no immediate reports of any casualties among Israelis or Palestinians in the recovery operation.Hamas is still believed to be holding around 110 hostages captured on Oct. 7. Israeli authorities estimate around a third are dead.Hamas-led militants burst through Israel's defenses on Oct. 7 and rampaged across the south, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Over 100 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel during last year's cease-fire.Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The air and ground offensive has caused widespread destruction and forced the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents to flee their homes, often multiple times. Aid groups fear the outbreak of diseases like polio.An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday killed at least 12 people at a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City. The Palestinian Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run government, said around 700 people had been sheltering at the Mustafa Hafez school. Israel's military said the strike targeted Hamas militants who had set up a command center inside the school.""We don't know where to go ... or where to shelter our children,"" said Um Khalil Abu Agwa, a displaced woman at the site.An Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah hit people walking down the street and seven were killed, including a woman and two children, according to an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies. More than 20 others were wounded.Another airstrike in central Gaza killed five children and their mother, according to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where an AP journalist counted the bodies.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting Egypt and Qatar to push for a cease-fire.

She also addressed Trump’s insinuations about Kamala Harris and other Democrats not being “real Americans,” asserting, “No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American, no one.”The former First Lady’s speech was not solely focused on attacking Trump; she also issued a call to action for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation. “Look, I don’t care how you identify politically, whether you’re Democrat, Republican, independent, or none of the above, this is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right,” Michelle said. “To stand up, not just for our basic freedoms, but for decency and humanity, for basic respect, dignity, and empathy for the values at the very foundation of this democracy.”Turning her attention to Kamala Harris, Michelle praised the vice president as one of the most qualified candidates ever to seek the presidency. “Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency,” Michelle said, highlighting Harris’s accomplishments and her dignified representation, which she attributed to a legacy of strong women.Michelle opened her speech with a message of hope, reflecting on a nation fraught with uncertainty and subtly critiquing Trump’s tenure. “America, hope is making a comeback,” she declared, sparking a standing ovation from the crowd.","Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday.

Deep seas and tight spaces impede search for 6 missing after yacht sinks off Sicily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deep-seas-and-tight-spaces-impede-search-for-6-missing-after-yacht-sinks-off-sicily/articleshow/112666561.cms,"PORTICELLO: Police divers resumed searching Tuesday for six people believed trapped in the hull of a superyacht that sank in deep seas off Sicily , including British tech magnate Mike Lynch , who was celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with the people who had defended him at trial.The luxury sailboat, off Porticello near Palermo, was about 50 meters (164 feet) underwater - far deeper than most recreational divers are certified for and a depth that requires special precautions.Recovery crews could only stay for 12-minute shifts, a measure that slowed efforts to reach the cramped inside of the wreck.Divers tag-teamed the shifts and were using a remote-controlled underwater vehicle, or ROV, to help in the search . They hadn't been able to access the below-deck cabins because they were blocked by furniture that shifted during the violent storm that struck the vessel early Monday. Rescue crews said they assume the missing six are in those cabins because the storm struck when most would be sleeping, but the teams haven't verified their presence there through portholes.The Bayesian, a 56-meter (184-foot) British-flagged yacht, was moored about a kilometer (a half-mile) offshore when a storm rolled in before 4 a.m. Monday. Civil protection officials said they believed the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.Grainy film from closed-circuit cameras from shore, broadcast on the website of the Giornale di Sicilia, showed the majestic, illuminated 75-meter (246-foot) mast of the Bayesian weathering the storm and then disappearing over the course of a minute.Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her 1-year-old baby over the waves to save her. One body was recovered, identified by officials as the Antiguan-born on-board chef. The rest of the 10-person crew survived, including the captain whom prosecutors reportedly sought to interview.The survivors were rescued by a nearby sailboat after getting into a lifeboat.Lynch, who was once hailed as Britain's king of technology, was cleared in June of fraud and conspiracy charges in a U.S. federal trial related to Hewlett Packard's $11 billion takeover of his company, Autonomy Corp. His wife, Angela Bacares, survived the sinking. Hannah Lynch, the couple's 18-year-old daughter, is reportedly unaccounted for.Also unaccounted for are Christopher Morvillo, one of Lynch's lawyers, and his wife, Neda; and Jonathan Bloomer, a chairman at Morgan Stanley International and the former head of the Autonomy audit committee who testified in Lynch's defense, and his wife.Karsten Borner, the captain of the Sir Robert Baden Powell, which rescued the survivors, said he was close enough to see the Bayesian as the storm came in.""A moment later, she was gone,"" he said.""It's a great, great tragedy,"" said Britain's ambassador to Italy, Edward Llewellyn, who visited Porticello on Tuesday. Britain sent four investigators to the scene, given the disaster involved a British-flagged ship and British citizens were among the missing.Luca Cari, a spokesman for the rescue teams, said the search was proceeding much more slowly than another big shipwreck in Italy, the 2012 Costa Concordia cruise ship that flipped on its side off Tuscany's coast, because of the depth of the wreck and the limited space divers have to maneuver.""That was much simpler. Here everything is more tight,"" he said.The outing was intended at least in part as a celebration of Lynch's acquittal and a ""looking forward to what was coming next,"" said Reid Weingarten, a Washington attorney and a member of Lynch's defense team who was not on the yacht.""A lot of people went, a lot of people were planning to go and then, of course, this happened,"" Weingarten said.Weingarten worked with Morvillo and said he ""was like a brother.""Aki Hussain, CEO of international insurer Hiscox Group, where Bloomer was chairman, said the company was ""deeply shocked and saddened by this tragic event.""""Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular our Chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife Judy, who are among the missing, and with their family as they await further news from this terrible situation,"" he added.Among the survivors, the Emslie family was released from Palermo's pediatric hospital on Tuesday. Charlotte Golunski had reported that she momentarily lost hold of her 1-year-old daughter, Sofia, in the water but then managed to hold her up over the waves until they were both pulled to safety, doctors said.The father, identified by ANSA news agency as James Emslie, also survived.""They don't talk much, primarily because they consider themselves survivors and they don't understand why they survived given what they went through,"" said Dr. Domenico Cipolla, head of the emergency room at Di Cristina pediatric hospital.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Cipolla said the parents had been in touch with other survivors, who are being housed at a nearby hotel and were waiting for other family members to arrive in Sicily.The Bayesian, built in 2008 by the Italian firm Perini Navi, is registered to Revtom Ltd., according to online maritime database Equasis. Bacares, Lynch's wife, is listed as Revtom's sole owner, according to corporate registration documents from the Isle of Man.According to online charter companies, it had been available for charter for 195,000 euros (about $215,000) a week and was notable for its massive 75-meter-tall (246-foot-tall) aluminum mast, one of the tallest in the world.The coast guard said to date there was no trace of fuel leaks from the wreckage.In an unrelated event, Lynch's co-defendant in the Autonomy trial who was also cleared, Stephen Chamberlain, was killed Sunday when he was hit by a car while running in Cambridgeshire, England, said Chamberlain's lawyer, Gary Lincenberg.","Divers tag-teamed the shifts and were using a remote-controlled underwater vehicle.

In a surprising turn, Donald Trump praised former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, during an interview with CNN on Monday. Trump, who has previously clashed with Obama, described him as a “nice gentleman” and expressed respect for both the former president and his wife.“I think he's a nice gentleman, but he was very weak on trade. If you take a look at what happened to our country trade-wise, it was a disaster,” Trump remarked.Despite his criticism of Obama’s trade policies , Trump emphasized his personal respect, stating, “I happen to like him. I respect him and I respect his wife.”Trump’s comments come in stark contrast to his earlier stance, where he fueled birtherism conspiracy theories against Obama and cited Obama’s mockery at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner as a catalyst for his own presidential ambitions.On the same day, Trump denounced the Democratic National Convention (DNC) programming as ""lies"", as quoted by the New York Post. He criticized the DNC's coverage, predicting that Obama would continue to propagate the same misinformation during his keynote address.“I think it was about lies. It was lies about me, all night long they were saying things that weren't true,” Trump stated.

"US elections: Tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, new poll shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-tight-race-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-new-poll-shows/articleshow/112667101.cms,"A recent Roanoke College poll reveals a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump among likely Virginia voters . Conducted before this week’s Democratic National Convention, the survey shows Harris with a narrow lead of 47% compared to Trump’s 44%. However, this margin falls within the poll’s margin of error of ±4.5 percentage points, reported the Washington Post.When additional candidates are considered, Harris maintains a slim three-point advantage over Trump, leading 45% to 42%.An additional 13% of voters express support for other candidates, including 6% for Robert F Kennedy Jr and 2% for Cornel West.Harry Wilson, a senior political analyst for the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, noted that the transition from President Joe Biden to Harris has had an impact, but not as significant as anticipated. Previously, Biden was in a similar position against Trump, with a marginal lead in May before his exit from the race.In the Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine holds a commanding lead, receiving 49% support against Republican challenger Hung Cao’s 38%. Kaine’s strong performance contrasts with the broader dissatisfaction reflected in the poll, reported the Washington Post.Republicans, led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, argue that Virginia remains a competitive battleground, despite Trump’s previous losses in the state by five points in 2016 and ten points in 2020. Nationally, Harris holds a slight edge over Trump, an improvement over Biden’s performance.President Biden’s approval ratings in Virginia remain low, with only 37% of voters viewing him favorably and 61% unfavorably. Harris fares somewhat better, though she remains a net negative, with 43% favorable and 53% unfavorable. Trump’s ratings are between the two, with 40% favorable and 57% unfavorable.Both parties’ vice-presidential candidates also face negative ratings, with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz at 34% favorable and 51% unfavorable, and GOP Sen. JD Vance at 32% favorable and 55% unfavorable. In contrast, Kaine enjoys a favorable rating of 50%, while Youngkin scores 54% favorable with high job approval.The poll indicates a polarized electorate, with 51% of voters viewing Trump as a “threat to democracy” and 47% expressing similar concerns about the process leading to Harris’s nomination. Dissatisfaction is also noted regarding Walz and Vance, reflecting a broader sense of discontent.Wilson emphasized the ongoing polarization between party lines, with diminishing third-party support potentially influencing the election outcome. The survey, conducted from August 12 to August 16, included 691 likely voters, with data collected through phone calls, text messages, and an online panel.","A recent Roanoke College poll reveals a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

King Charles III terminates security for Prince Andrew at Royal Lodge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-iii-terminates-security-for-prince-andrew-at-royal-lodge/articleshow/112610762.cms,"King Charles III has reportedly terminated the security team stationed at Prince Andrew 's residence, the Royal Lodge , as the Duke of York continues to resist calls to downsize from the property. The decision has fueled speculation that the disgraced royal may soon be forced to vacate his longtime home.According to The Sun, Charles informed the ten-man security detail that their contracts would not be renewed after October.“They are all working the final weeks of their contract till the end of October. It’s not thought anyone is being lined up to replace them,” a palace insider told the outlet. The source added, “Everyone is speculating this means the Duke will have to leave the Royal Lodge because what other reason could there be to take his security away?”Prince Andrew, 64, has resided at the 31-room Royal Lodge, located on the grounds of Windsor Castle , since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease agreement the previous year. The property, valued at $38 million, has been Andrew's home despite the mounting controversy surrounding his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein . Since 2019, Andrew has faced eviction pressures following revelations of his ties to Epstein.Further compounding his troubles, Andrew has reportedly neglected to pay for the maintenance of the property, which requires an annual upkeep of $503,000, as reported by Us Weekly in May. The financial strain on the Duke has been significant, with King Charles reportedly paying his younger brother $5.1 million annually to keep him financially afloat.Additionally, the King has been covering the cost of private security at the Royal Lodge since Andrew's $3.8 million Metropolitan Police protection was removed when he was stripped of his royal roles by Queen Elizabeth II.“It isn’t a secret that the King wants him out,” the insider told The Sun.The latest security move comes after reports that Andrew has refused to vacate the Royal Lodge for the smaller Frogmore Cottage, the former residence of his nephew Prince Harry, who was forced to leave the property in June 2023.Despite the tensions, Andrew traveled to Scotland on Friday to join his brother and the rest of the royal family at Balmoral Castle. He will be accompanied by his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, and their grandchildren, according to Express.co.uk. Notably absent from the official guest list were Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle.Andrew has been described as a “recluse,” rarely leaving the Royal Lodge since December. A source told Express.co.uk, “Andrew has hardly left Royal Lodge since Christmas so he’s very much looking forward to getting away with the rest of the family at Balmoral. The King is keen for it to be a happy family occasion which will see members of the family come together for just over a week to discuss plans for the future and to unwind.”","King Charles III has reportedly terminated the security team stationed at Prince Andrew's residence, the Royal Lodge.

Presidential Election: Harris packs the Wisconsin arena that hosted the RNC while the Obamas address the DNC in Chicago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-packs-the-wisconsin-arena-that-hosted-the-rnc-while-the-obamas-address-the-dnc-in-chicago/articleshow/112668574.cms,"CHICAGO: Kamala Harris rallied thousands of voters in one packed arena as former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama energized millions more on Harris' behalf inside another on a Tuesday night designed to demonstrate the energy and breadth of the Democratic nominee 's evolving coalition.""I am feeling hope,"" Obama told the Democratic National Convention in Chicago just minutes after his wife, the former first lady Michelle Obama, told the same crowd that, ""Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn't it?""""America, hope is making a comeback,"" she said.Harris, speaking earlier in battleground Wisconsin - at a rally in the arena where Republicans held their convention last month - declared that she was running ""a people-powered campaign.""""Together we will chart a new way forward,"" the vice president said in remarks that were partially broadcast to the DNC. ""A future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith.""The raucous night of events spanning two states underscored the diversity of the coalition that Harris' campaign is working to stitch together in her bid to defeat Trump this fall. She is drawing on the party's biggest stars, leaders from the far left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.And while the theme of the night was ""a bold vision for America's future,"" the disparate factions of Harris' evolving coalition demonstrated, above all, that they are connected by a deep desire to prevent a second Trump presidency.Obama, the nation's first Black president, returned to the convention stage 20 years after making his first appearance at a national convention, a 2004 appearance in Boston that propelled him into the national spotlight ahead of his successful presidential run.""History will remember Joe Biden as a president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,"" Obama said on Tuesday as the crowd chanted, ""Thank you, Joe."" ""I am proud to call him my president, but even prouder to call him my friend.""Sens. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by progressives, both praised Harris.And in an appearance perhaps intended to needle Trump, his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham - now a harsh critic of her former boss - also took the convention stage.Trump ""has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,"" Grisham said. ""I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people. And she has my vote.""Still, it was not all serious on the second night of the four-day convention.A symbolic roll call in which delegates from each state pledged their support for the Democratic nominee turned into a party atmosphere. A DJ played a mix of state-specific songs - and Atlanta native Lil Jon ran out during Georgia's turn to his hit song with DJ Snake, ""Turn Down for What,"" to the delight of the thousands inside the cavernous United Center.Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who would become the nation's first gentleman if his wife wins the presidency, shared personal details about his relationship with Harris - their cooking habits, their first date and her laugh, which is often mocked by Republican critics.""You know that laugh. I love that laugh!"" Emhoff said as the crowd cheered. Later, he added, ""Her empathy is her strength.""Trump, meanwhile, was out on the campaign trail as part of his weeklong swing-state tour during the Democratic convention. He went to Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday and stood aside sheriff's deputies as he labeled Harris the ""ringleader"" of a ""Marxist attack on law enforcement"" across the country.""Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death,"" Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris.Harris, meanwhile, cast the election in dire, almost existential terms. She implored Americans not to get complacent in light of the Supreme Court decision carving out broad presidential immunity, a power she said Trump would abuse.She has also seized on Trump's opposition to a nationally guaranteed right to abortion.""They seemingly don't trust women,"" she said of Trump and his Republican allies. ""Well, we trust women.""The vice president's speech evoked some of the same themes that underlaid Biden's case for reelection before he dropped out, casting Trump as a threat to democracy. Harris argued that Trump threatens the values and freedoms that Americans hold dear.Trump said he would be a dictator only on his first day in office, a quip he later said was a joke, and has vowed as president to assert more control over federal prosecutions, an area of government that has traditionally been left to the Justice Department.Someone with that record ""should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States,"" Harris said. ""Never again.""","Kamala Harris is drawing on the party's biggest stars, leaders from the far left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.

In 2021, Vance was asked whether there should be exceptions for rape and incest in abortion cases. It was then that JD Vance used the term ""inconvenience"". Appearing on NBC's 'Morning Joe', Beshear referred to that comment and said inconvenience is traffic, ""make him go through this"".What exactly did Vance say in 2021 on this? ""It’s not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term but whether a child should be allowed to live even though the circumstances of that child’s birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to society.""“It is someone being violated, someone being harmed, and then telling them that they don’t have options after that, that fails any test of decency, of humanity,"" Andy said reacting to that statement.Vance expressed his disgust and asked why Andy Beshear was wishing that a member of Vance's family should get raped. “His comments are disgusting, vile, and should not be tolerated in American politics. We call on Kamala Harris to immediately repudiate Governor Beshear’s comments and demonstrate that regardless of partisan disagreements, this kind of violent rhetoric has no place in our public discourse,” Vance's communications director said in a statement.Beshear took a step back and said he was of course not wishing any harm on Vance's family. “It’s ridiculous, but it’s also deflection. JD Vance knows that he and Donald Trump are so wrong on this issue, and so he’s trying to make himself the victim,” Beshear said.“As a man, JD Vance will never have to face any of this personally, but it’s sad that he lacks the empathy to be able to put himself in a different position and to understand why having exceptions, having reproductive freedom, is so important in the first place,” Andy added. “Obviously, I never wish harm on anyone. It [is] just again, deflection, trying to make himself and Donald Trump the victims.”","Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear said 'Make him go through this"" on Republican VP candidate JD Vance's past comment of calling pregnancy from rape an ""inconvenience"" In 2021, Vance was asked whether there should be exceptions for rape and incest in abortion cases.

But now Tim Walz's wife Gwen clarified that it was not in vitro fertilization but a different procedure called intrauterine insemination. Tim Walz, however, mentioned IVF whenever he spoke of their struggles to become parents.The revelation invited a sharp attack from GOP VP candidate JD Vance who earlier accused Tim Walz of lying about serving in war. ""Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF. Who lies about something like that?"" JD Vance said.Gwen said the fertility process was a difficult and personal experience. “Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time – not even sharing the details with our wonderful and close family. The only person who knew in detail what we were going through was our next-door neighbor,” she said in the statement. “She was a nurse and helped me with the shots I needed as part of the IUI process. I’d rush home from school and she would give me the shots to ensure we stayed on track,” she continued.In IVF, egg is removed from a person's body and combined with a sperm in the lab and then it's implanted in the womb but in intrauterine insemination, sperm is placed directly in the uterus.Harris campaign, however, dismissed the IVF, IUI row and said Tim Walz referred to it as IVF like a normal person as IVF is the commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.Gwen said that they decided to formally speak about their struggles with infertility and their journey after seeing the extreme attacks on reproductive health care.","Tim Walz's wife Gwen clarified that it was not in vitro fertilization but a different procedure called intrauterine insemination.

More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.
