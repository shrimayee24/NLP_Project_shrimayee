At least three spectators who went to watch the Indian Air Force 's air show in Chennai died on Sunday after the event.

The Begusarai MP hit back at Owaisi, saying, ""Mohan Bhagwat has not said anything wrong. The real danger to India comes from people like Owaisi and his thinking. Anti-India sentiments are embedded in Owaisi's DNA.""Defending RSS chief's call for for "" Hindu unity "", he said, ""The current situation demands that all Sanatanis in India come together.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

As reviewed by the New York Times, the memoir is slim and full of obfuscations and reads more like her CV as it is not confessional and leaves out more than it includes. But if there is one thing clear from the memoir that is her love for Barron Trump .And there is only one review on the black cover and that is from Donald Trump with a mention of Barron. “Melania’s commitment to excellence starts with her family,” former President Donald J. Trump wrote, “which Barron and I cherish deeply.”The memoir has many mentions of Barron Trump -- how he was bullied for the fake online claims that he was autistic. Melania said that episode turned her towards the safely of children in the age of social media. She acknowledged that she would never forgive TV personality Rosie O'Donnell for making that fake claim for which she also apologized.Rosie O'Donnell had a long-standing feud with Donald Trump and in 2016 she shared a video of a 10-year-old Barron clapping for his father. But Rosie pointed out that little Barron's hands were not touching when he was clapping which, she claimed, was an autistic trait.“Barron’s experience of being bullied both online and in real life following the incident is a clear indication of the irreparable damage caused,” Melania wrote. “There is nothing shameful about autism (though O’Donnell’s tweet implied that there was), but Barron is not autistic,” Melania said, accusing O’Donnell of “sheer malice.”“It was clear to me that she was not interested in raising awareness about autism. I felt that she was attacking my son because she didn’t like my husband,"" Melania said.In a recent promotional video, Melania talked about the first meeting with Donald Trump. “From the moment Donald and I met, there was an undeniable spark. There was something magnetic about him: his confidence, his charm, his humor, his vision,"" Melania said.The memoir sidestepped the controversies of Donald Trump's life -- there's no mention of Stormy Daniels or Capitol Riot.",Melania Trump's memoir is slim and full of obfuscations and reads more like her CV as it is not confessional and leaves out more than it includes.

Vice President Kamala Harris , who has touted her gun ownership throughout her presidential campaign finally confirmed that she owns a Glock handgun, citing her background in law enforcement as the reason for her decision.During a recent 60 Minutes interview , speaking with Bill Whitaker, Harris said she has had the gun for quite some time, explaining, “My background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.”When asked whether she had ever fired the gun, Harris replied, ""Yes, of course I have,"" clarifying that she had used it at a shooting range.Her admission comes as gun control remains a significant issue in the elections, with the MAGA accusing Harris of endorsing a gun buyback.During her debate with Republican Donald Trump, she previously mentioned being a firearm owner while strongly opposing the idea that Democrats seek to confiscate guns. At the time, Harris reassured voters, saying, ""This business about taking everyone's guns away — Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away.""However, Harris has long supported stricter gun regulations, including universal background checks and bans on assault weapons. However, by sharing her personal experience as a gun owner, she attempts to connect with gun owners and bridge the divide between advocating for responsible firearm ownership and pushing for tighter controls.Her remarks come at a pivotal moment as the gun control debate continues to intensify. While Harris advocates for increased restrictions, her own experience with firearms serves to address concerns from the pro-gun community. Balancing these views is key for Harris as she appeals to a broad range of voters on the sensitive issue of gun rights.In the same interview, Harris was also asked if she would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war. She firmly stated that she would not meet him ""bilaterally without Ukraine."" Harris added, ""Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine."" She criticised former President Donald Trump’s claims that he could end the war on day one, calling it a path to ""surrender.""","Vice President Kamala Harris has confirmed that she owns a Glock handgun.

US Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped a direct answer when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could still be considered a ""close ally"" of the United States, according to Al Jazeera.In an interview excerpt with CBS News's 60 Minutes, released on Sunday, Harris was questioned about the US response to Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza and Lebanon amid growing criticism of Netanyahu's actions, despite calls from the US for de-escalation.Democratic candidate Harris in the upcoming November presidential election, responded by emphasising US efforts to pressure both Israel and Arab nations in the Middle East to agree to a ceasefire. ""The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel,"" she told 60 Minutes.When pressed on whether the US still considers Netanyahu a ""real, close ally,"" Harris deflected, saying, ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people?

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed , the armorer involved in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film ""Rust,"" pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of carrying a firearm into a licensed liquor establishment. This plea comes as part of an agreement that will see her serve 18 months of supervised probation.Judge T. Glenn Ellington approved the plea deal, allowing Gutierrez-Reed to start her probation while serving an 18-month prison term for involuntary manslaughter related to Hutchins' death.During the tragic incident, actor Alec Baldwin discharged a revolver while rehearsing a scene, resulting in Hutchins' death and injury to director Joel Souza.Prosecutors have pointed to Gutierrez-Reed's negligence in bringing live ammunition onto the film set and failing to adhere to essential gun safety protocols. She appeared in court on Monday wearing a beige jumpsuit and was handcuffed as she changed her plea to guilty, expressing her gratitude to the court: ""I’d just like to apologise to the court and thank you for your judgement today.""The charge stems from an incident weeks before filming began in October 2021, when Gutierrez-Reed brought a handgun into a bar in Santa Fe, where firearms are prohibited.

Baldwin faced similar charges but had them dismissed during a trial due to issues regarding evidence disclosure.As part of her plea agreement, Gutierrez-Reed must avoid firearms, alcohol, and drugs during her probation, pay £180 in fees, and submit DNA to a criminal database. Her attorney indicated that she could be released by June 2025 to complete probation in Arizona, avoiding a further felony conviction.Before leaving the courtroom, Gutierrez-Reed blew kisses to her mother, Stacy Reed, who expressed her support, stating, “She’s not gotten a fair shake from the beginning.”","Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was involved in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film ""Rust"" She pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of carrying a firearm into a licensed liquor establishment.

Hurricane Milton: What to know about Category 5 storm as it roars towards Florida,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hurricane-milton-what-to-know-about-category-5-storm-as-it-roars-towards-florida/articleshow/114028614.cms,"Contractors with the City of New Port Richey help clean debris left by Hurricane Helene in preparation for Hurricane Milton.

How are local services being affected by the storm?

Hurricane Milton , a massive Category 5 storm , is rapidly approaching Florida’s Gulf Coast, threatening to hit the Tampa Bay region, which has not faced a major direct hurricane impact in over a century. The storm comes just two weeks after Hurricane Helene ravaged the same area, leaving significant destruction and debris behind. As Milton's landfall nears, authorities are racing to clear the remaining debris from Helene to prevent it from becoming airborne missiles, while evacuation orders have been issued in several regions.The storm has already intensified with winds reaching 180 mph and poses a serious risk of storm surges, flooding, and wind damage across Florida's west coast.Many residents, still recovering from Helene, are preparing for what could be one of the most severe storms to hit the area in decades. Meanwhile, the federal and state governments are mobilizing resources to manage the storm's impact, with tensions rising as political leaders clash over storm preparedness and response efforts.Hurricane Milton is a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph. The storm is moving toward Florida and is expected to make landfall in the Tampa Bay region on Wednesday. As it approaches, it could weaken slightly but will likely retain hurricane strength as it moves across central Florida and exits into the Atlantic Ocean.Milton is considered potentially catastrophic, especially since it comes on the heels of Hurricane Helene, which struck Florida just two weeks ago. Milton intensified quickly, gaining 92 mph in 24 hours, which is one of the fastest rates recorded. The National Hurricane Center reports that Milton's pressure is near record low, signaling its strength. Meteorologists have compared its rapid intensification to storms like Hurricane Wilma (2005) and Hurricane Felix (2007).The Tampa Bay area is at high risk, with forecasts predicting storm surges between 8 to 12 feet, the highest ever predicted for the region. In addition, widespread flooding is expected, with rainfall estimates between 5 to 10 inches across Florida and up to 15 inches in some areas. Other affected regions include Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Florida’s mainland and Keys.Florida’s government has mobilized efforts to remove debris left by Hurricane Helene to prevent it from becoming dangerous projectiles during Milton. Hillsborough County has issued evacuation orders for areas near Tampa Bay, mobile homes, and vulnerable regions. Federal assistance, including 7,000 workers, has been dispatched, and President Biden has declared a state of emergency for Florida.Residents in affected areas are rushing to evacuate or prepare for the storm. Many have expressed concerns about debris from Hurricane Helene turning into dangerous projectiles. Sarah Steslicki from Belleair Beach criticized the slow removal of debris, stating, “They’ve screwed around and haven’t picked the debris up, and now they’re scrambling to get it picked up.” Others, like Candice Briggs from Seminole, are emotionally drained from evacuating just two weeks after Helene, saying, “Most of the tears I’ve cried have been out of exhaustion or gratitude.”Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 230 people, has highlighted the growing intensity of storms, particularly due to climate change. FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell warned that “these storms are bringing more water than they ever have” and emphasized that while wind remains a risk, flooding is the primary cause of fatalities. Researchers believe warmer oceans are fueling the rapid intensification of these storms.Hurricane Milton has sparked political tensions, with Vice President Kamala Harris criticizing Governor Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump for what she called “political gamesmanship” in the wake of Hurricane Helene. She accused DeSantis of ignoring federal support offers and Trump of spreading misinformation about disaster funds. DeSantis, meanwhile, has been coordinating directly with President Biden to manage the storm response.Several Florida counties are converting schools into shelters, and airports in Tampa, St Petersburg, and Orlando have announced closures. Fuel shortages have been reported, with gas stations in Fort Myers and Tampa running out of fuel as people evacuate.(With inputs from agencies)","Hurricane Milton is a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph.

When asked about the rumored client list associated with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump said he would be inclined to examine it and expressed no objections to its release if the opportunity arose.Musk has recently ramped up his support for Trump, appearing at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. This marks Musk's first public endorsement since Trump's attempted assassination in July.

Former US President Donald Trump stirred debate on Monday by suggesting that undocumented immigrants who commit murder possess “bad genes,” during an interview on “The Hugh Hewitt Show .”In the interview, Trump distorted immigration and crime statistics to criticise Vice President Kamala Harris , falsely claiming that “13,000 of which were murderers” were crossing through an “open border.” He said, “You know, now, a murderer, I believe this – it’s in their genes.And we got bad, a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for further comment. This rhetoric aligns with Trump's ongoing campaign strategy, which has made reducing illegal immigration a central focus. His language regarding undocumented immigrants has drawn criticism from civil rights groups , particularly after he claimed last autumn that they were “poisoning the blood of our country.”Additionally, Trump has previously invoked genetics at campaign rallies, stating in 2020, “You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory .” This comment references the notion that selective breeding in horses produces superior bloodlines, a concept that has drawn parallels to discussions on race and genetics.","Former US President Donald Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants who commit murder possess ""bad genes"" Trump distorted immigration and crime statistics to criticise Vice President Kamala Harris.

Supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan reached Islamabad's iconic D-Chowk late on Saturday, despite the government's efforts to deter them by deploying a heavy police force and cutting off internet services in the capital. The police's use of tear gas to stop protesters was largely ineffective as heavy rain in the capital weakened its impact, Dawn reported.Meanwhile, the Islamabad high court ordered the Pakistan government to prevent any illegal protests in the capital during the SCO summit.However, the court instructed government to assign a specific location for supporters of jailed former PM to hold demonstrations.Islamabad was placed under a strict lockdown on Saturday as authorities sought to prevent the demonstration, which comes in support of the imprisoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. His supporters have been consistently staging protests over the past month, demanding his release.The rallies also target the ruling coalition government, which Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ), claims is illegitimate, alleging that it came to power following a fraudulent election.Pakistan army troops were deployed in Islamabad to ensure security as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters moved forward with plans for a protest.Meanwhile, Pakistan's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that more than 80 police personnel have been injured so far in clashes with supporters of Imran Khan taking part in a march near Islamabad.Khan, who was barred from participating in the February elections due to numerous legal cases against him, has been sidelined from the political arena. However, Imran Khan's PTI has continued to challenge the government by organising regular demonstrations and protests despite facing a crackdown.Earlier in the day, the PTI claimed that Pakistani Rangers “forcefully entered” KP House in Islamabad to arrest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur after he arrived in the capital to take part in the protest.PTI workers set out from Khan's stronghold in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Friday, intending to reach the capital Islamabad. However, they were met with roadblocks made of shipping containers and rounds of tear gas fired by security forces.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi warned Khan's party on Friday to cancel the planned protest, saying that there would be ""no leniency"" if the ban on protests is defied. He accused armed supporters of Khan of marching on Islamabad with the intention of launching an assault on the capital. “They should think about what they are going to do with Pakistan by marching on Islamabad with weapons,” he said.“I am very clear that they are going to launch an assault on Islamabad,” Naqvi said. He urged Imran Khan's party to postpone their rally to avoid disrupting the capital city's preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on October 15 and 16.On Saturday, small groups of protesters persisted in their efforts to enter the capital, defying the government's decision to deploy troops on the streets. The government justified the deployment as a necessary measure to ensure security ahead of the upcoming SCO.""I am so proud of all our people,"" Khan said in a message posted on the social media platform X on Saturday afternoon. ""You showed unfaltering resilience and courage as you came out yesterday and overcame unbelievable obstacles to keep marching forward towards D Chowk.""Lahore's D-Chowk or Democracy Chowk is known in Pakistan as the place where various protests routinely take place. In the past, Imran Khan had a 126-day sit-in protest here in 2014.Imran Khan urged citizens to continue their journey to D Chowk and join the convoy led by Ali Amin. ""I am calling on everyone to keep heading to D Chowk and join Ali Amin's convoy. I especially want to commend our people from KP, North Punjab, and Islamabad. You have defeated insurmountable obstacles, including shelling, chemicals fired from helicopters, trenches & nails on the motorway, with your determination and commitment,"" Imran Khan said.The former Prime Minister also called upon the people of Punjab to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan in Lahore. ""I am also asking our people from Punjab to move towards Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. If they cannot make it there, they must join the protests in their cities,"" he said.Protests were also planned in Lahore on Saturday, but access to the city was restricted as the main road connecting it to the capital was blocked. Amnesty International criticised the communication cuts and road blockades, saying that they ""infringe on people's right to freedom of expression, access to information, peaceful assembly and movement."" The rights group further added, ""These restrictions are part of a worrying clampdown on the right to protest in Pakistan.""Imran Khan, 72, served as Pakistan's Prime Minister from 2018 to 2022 before being removed from office through a parliamentary no-confidence vote. His ousting came after he fell out of favour with the powerful military establishment, which is considered to be the kingmaker in Pakistani politics.Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has claimed that Khan's party aims to weaken the country's economy through violent protests despite the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban.Despite Imran Khan being in jail since August 2023, candidates supported by him secured the most seats in the general election held in February.

Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to a statement from the Pakistan military on Saturday.Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ), the military's media wing, said that the exchange of fire occurred during the night between October 4-5 in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district, which shares a border with Afghanistan.Lieutenant colonel Muhammad Ali Shoukat, aged 43, who was leading the operation against the terrorists, lost his life along with five other soldiers during the ""intense fire exchange"", the Pakistan military said.The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for the attack.
