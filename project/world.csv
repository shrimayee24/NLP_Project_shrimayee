Jailed BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal delivered 80 missiles to forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jailed-brahmos-scientist-delivered-80-missiles-to-forces/articleshow/110949074.cms,"NAGPUR: Former BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal , who was sentenced to life by a sessions court here on June 3 for leaking military secrets to Pakistan, worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur and was involved in delivery of close to 80 missiles to the armed forces during his four-year stint.

He had access to customers and delivery locations of missiles, as per Major General (retd) Achyut Deo, general manager, BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), who deposed as a witness during Nishant's trial.

Last week, Nishant was sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court under the IT Act and Official Secrets Act. He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.

Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.

Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.

However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.

Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.

The Indian missions in Russia are collaborating with local authorities to facilitate the repatriation of the deceased students' bodies to their families.

TOI

NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked officials to deploy the full strength of counter-terror apparatus against terrorists behind recent strikes in Jammu, law enforcement agencies are seeing the current jihadi escalation as an effort to open a new axis of violence and unrest in Jammu region.On a day when PM Modi reviewed the uptick in terrorist violence with NSA Ajit Doval and others, J&K DGP R R Swain said counter-terrorism strategies were being tweaked to beat the “unique challenge” represented by 40-50 terrorists who infiltrated from Pakistan and were now holed up in the mountainous terrain of Jammu — where road connectivity and communication facilities do not match those in the flat-floor Valley, making it longer for security forces to respond to information.The shift in security strategy includes returning to the force deployment pattern of the 1990s, with more personnel guarding mountain tops, resuming and intensifying counter-terror operations sector-wise and strengthening village defence committees in Jammu by refining their training and equipping them better to bust terror strikes.Maintaining that attacks in Reasi, Doda and Kathua were a recent phenomenon in that particular axis, the J&K police chief said, “After the Valley is relatively pacified, terrorist outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba have shifted attention to Jammu, activating different axes that run through Chenab, Tawi and Ujh-Ravi rivers. It is a determined effort on part of Pakistan-based elements to ratchet up things for reasons that include boosting morale of their fighters and creating inter-communal tension in a region with mixed population (by religion),” Swain toldover phone.Citing the difficult topography and demography of areas within Jammu (with a 60:40 Hindu-Muslim population), Swain indicated the terrorists may be trying to target civilians from a particular community with a design to spark communal unrest, thus creating a law and order challenge. He, however, said the lack of separatist sentiment in Jammu, unlike how things were in Kashmir, was one less headache for security forces.Reasi, where nine people died Sunday after terrorists fired on a bus, has 70% of contiguous mountainous terrain, which Swain said offered the hiding terrorists an advantage as there was invariably a time gap between information reaching the forces and follow-up action.The plan now is to step up deployment in the mountain tops of Jammu to keep an eye on infiltration attempts and challenge the terrorists hiding there after crossing over from Pakistan, the DGP said.","J&K DGP R R Swain said counter-terrorism strategies were being tweaked to beat the ‘unique challenge’ represented by 40-50 terrorists.

A division bench of Justice MS Ramesh and Justice Sunder Mohan, however, said the petitioner is at liberty to approach the state govt for his temporary release to take treatment for his alleged injuries.

On May 4, Shankar was arrested by Coimbatore police for his derogatory remark against women police in an interview published by a YouTube channel.

On May 12, he was detained under the Goondas Act on a ground case filed based on a complaint from CMDA for alleged offences of forgery and cheating.

Aggrieved, his mother A Kamala moved the present habeas corpus plea challenging his preventive detention.

Since judges of a vacation bench differed in their opinions in quashing the detention without providing adequate opportunity for the state to respond, the issue was referred to a third judge.

The third judge also opined that the state must be heard before taking a decision in the petition and forwarded the case to the division bench handling HCP portfolio.

On Wednesday, the division bench adjourned the hearing after eight weeks.

The agreement, signed on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy, is meant to be a step towards Ukraine's eventual Nato membership, according to the text of the deal. ""The parties recognise this agreement as supporting a bridge to Ukraine's eventual membership in the Nato alliance,"" the text says.

Zelenskyy has long sought Nato membership but the allies have stopped short of taking that step. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause. In the event of an armed attack or threat of such against Ukraine, top US and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on a response and determine what additional defence needs are required for Ukraine, the agreement says.

Russia: Detained US reporter will stand trial over 'CIA work',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-detained-us-reporter-will-stand-trial-over-cia-work/articleshow/110978503.cms,"Russian prosecutors said Thursday they had sent the case of detained US reporter Evan Gershkovich to court after concluding he had been collecting information for the US Central Intelligence Agency about a Russian tank factory. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested on March 29, 2023, in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on charges of espionage that carry up to 20 years in prison after the FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, said it had caught him ""red-handed"" trying to obtain military secrets.

Gershkovich and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have flatly denied the charges and the newspaper has repeatedly called for his immediate release. The White House has called the charges ""ridiculous"", with Prez Biden calling the detention ""totally illegal"".

The office of Russia 's General Prosecutor said in a statement it had approved Gershkovich's criminal indictment and that his case would be heard by a court in Yekaterinburg, where he was originally arrested. It did not say when the case would be heard or whether the trial would be closed to the public as is common in such cases.

""The investigation has established and confirmed with documentary evidence that Gershkovich, on the instructions of the CIA , collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defence plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment,"" the prosecutors' statement said. Prosecutors did not release any documentary evidence to back the charge.

Gershkovich, the first US journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, is currently being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow and has been the subject of so far fruitless prisoner exchange talks between Moscow and Washington.

The Uralvagonzavod factory, which has been sanctioned by the West, is based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in Russia's Sverdlovsk region and, according to the Russian defence ministry, plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow's war in Ukraine.

NEW DELHI: A crocodile that had terrorised a remote Australian community by 'stalking and lunging' at kids and adults and had eaten up dogs got cooked up by the locals ending up in a traditional feast, AFP reported.

The police, following consultations with elders and traditional landowners in the Bulla community, killed the reptile which was then cooked up in a ""traditional meal"" by the locals. ""The community prepared it for a feast in the traditional manner,"" they said.

According to Northern Territory police, the reptile which was almost 3.6 metre long had ""been stalking and lunging out of the water at children and adults"".

""The crocodile had also reportedly taken multiple community dogs,"" the statement said.

""I believe he was cooked up into crocodile tail soup, it was on the barbecue, a few pieces were wrapped up in banana leaves and cooked underground,"" Sergeant Andrew McBride told Australian public broadcaster ABC.

His opponent Donald Trump leads a Republican Party broadly favouring blocks to abortion access.The mifepristone case was the first significant abortion case heard by the conservative-dominated Supreme Court since it overturned the previously long-held constitutional right to abortion two years ago. ""We recognise that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the 9-0 opinion. ""But citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities,"" Kavanaugh said.The conservative justice said the federal courts were ""the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs' concerns about FDA's actions"" and they could present their objections through regulatory procedures or through the ""political and electoral processes"". Abortion opponents have been seeking to restrict nationwide access to the pill, claiming it is unsafe and that anti-abortion doctors were being forced to violate their conscience by intervening on patients who suffered complications after using it.Medication abortion accounted for 63% of the abortions in the country last year, up from 53% in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Some 20 states have banned or restricted abortion since the SC in June 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v.

President Joe Biden faces first lawsuit: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/president-joe-biden-faces-first-lawsuit-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/110968028.cms,"Here's all you need to know about the lawsuit:

The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).

and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES). Filed against Biden administration's order that came into effect on June 5, it restricts the asylum processing to 2500 per day. The imposed limitations will remain in place until the daily encounter figures, averaged over seven days, reach or fall below 1,500. However, it remains uncertain when this threshold will be met; the last instance occurred in July 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to the advocates, the order is ""legally indistinguishable"" from an order passed by Trump administration. “By enacting an asylum ban that is legally indistinguishable from the Trump ban we successfully blocked, we were left with no choice but to file this lawsuit, attorney Lee Gelernt said.

Biden has employed the same legal provision utilized by the Trump administration for its asylum prohibition, which falls within Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This provision grants the president the authority to restrict entry for specific migrants if their arrival is judged to be ""detrimental"" to national interests.

White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández justified Biden's directive. Fernández said in a statement that it became essential after bipartisan negotiations were obstructed by congressional Republicans. These negotiations aimed to secure vital resources, statutory adjustments, and additional personnel for border management.

NEW DELHI: In a first, a lawsuit was filed against the US administration on Wednesday over an order issued by President Joe Biden last week limiting the asylum processing claims to 2,500 per day on the southern border.The advocates have argued that the order is similar to the one enacted during Trump administration . However, it was later blocked by the courts.The directive became effective on June 5, with officials from the Biden administration anticipating unprecedented deportation rates of 4,000 daily.","The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.

The incident occurred on Sunday in the Richmond Hill area of New York, where approximately 26 per cent of the population is of Indian or Caribbean origin, as stated by the official.

The suspect has been named as Karamjit Multani (33), while the deceased victim, his brother, was identified as Vipanpal (27). The injured mother (52), who was shot in the stomach, has not yet been named.

According to the police, after fatally shooting his brother, Karamjit Multani turned the gun on himself.

""Karamjit's body was found dead near a street corner with a gunshot wound to his head,"" the police said.

Bhupinder Multani, the father of the suspect, informed reporters that there were no issues within the family, and he could not find any reason that would have prompted his son to take such an extreme action.

Jaspreet Singh, the brother-in-law of both the suspect and the victim, described Karamjit as one of the ""nicest"" men who always enjoyed making jokes, according to media reports.

The New York City Police Department has stated that they have taken up the case and are currently conducting an investigation.

Wes Moore said at a waterside news conference to highlight the milestone.As the governor spoke, a passing ship blasted its horn.""You hear that?"" Moore said. ""That's a beautiful sound.""Behind him, giant cranes lifted shipping containers from the deck of a docked cargo ship and deposited them on land.Many shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly collapse in March. The deadly disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore's busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.The estimated cost for the entire salvage operation is $160 million, with federal, state and local agencies involved.Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The port, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, is expected to be operating at normal capacity by mid-July.All that rerouted commercial traffic ""belongs in Baltimore today,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a news briefing earlier this week. ""We have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.""Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said.But thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse and its economic ripple effects, which extend well beyond the Baltimore region. State officials helped establish several relief programs to keep people employed and businesses afloat in the immediate aftermath.""We were a wounded port,"" said Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoreman's Association Local 333, which represents Baltimore port workers. In a competitive industry, he said, other ports were looking to take Baltimore's cargo.Reopening the channel means keeping thousands of longshoremen in their jobs, Cowan said.Officials estimated that the salvage operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will cost up to $75 million, while the Coast Guard response has cost $24 million to date to open the main channel. Maryland used about $60 million in federal emergency funds to open three other smaller channels outside the main one.Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it's completed by 2028.President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress.In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort.""Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,"" he said.The cargo ship Dali lost power and crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths.A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the vessel experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation.The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow, before being refloated and guided back to port May 20. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels.The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide. Officials said two-way traffic can now resume, and additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.",Commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore is expected to return to normal levels next month.

So, there is the possibility of the deal being undone by future US administrations.Former resident Donald Trump, who is also the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November. But, he has repeatedly affirmed that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how.He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defence and said he'd ""encourage"" Russia ""to do whatever the hell they want"" if Europe didn't increase its defence funding.The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine's defence, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said.An annexe to the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine's defence.National security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday that the US' commitment to Ukraine ""will continue to be right up front and clear"" at the G7 and that Washington ""will take bold steps to show Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine fight for freedom.""Kirby also said that president Biden and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet during the summit, and the US will announce steps to unlock Russia's frozen assets for use in Ukraine's reconstruction after the war ends, CNN reported.The pledge the US and Ukraine are expected to sign will be similar to the 14 other bilateral agreements Ukraine has already reached with other allies, including the UK, France and Germany.The US-Ukraine agreement will be the 15th such deal signed, one of the sources said, and 17 other countries have committed to negotiating similar bilateral security pacts with Ukraine.As part of the deal, the US will promise to hold consultations with Ukraine immediately following a future attack by Russia to determine next steps, said the people familiar with the agreement's contours.But the bilateral agreement with the US, like with Ukraine's other allies, will not include a mutual defence clause, which would commit them to defend Ukraine militarily in the event of another attack.While Zelenskyy has welcomed the bilateral commitments, he has repeatedly stressed that they are not a substitute for full Nato membership , which does have a mutual defence provision known as Article V, according to CNN.The agreement comes as the US-Ukrainian relationship has begun to recover after faltering late last year and into this year amid a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine - something Biden personally apologized to Zelenskyy for during a meeting in Paris last week.Recently, the Biden administration agreed to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike into Russia directly. This is a major shift that Ukraine had been asking for months amid repeated Russian missile attacks in Kharkiv.",The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy on Thursday. The deal lays out a path for Washington's long-term security relationship with Kyiv. It is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine's armed forces.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110956294,imgsize-765730,width-400,resizemode-4/110956294.jpg"
Why is Biden going to Europe twice in a week?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-biden-going-to-europe-twice-in-a-week/articleshow/110952455.cms,"Air Force One is plenty comfortable if you are its most privileged frequent flier, with a comfortable bedroom and a spacious office. Still, most US presidents will try to avoid making two back-to-back round trips to Europe, separated by about 60 hours on the ground at home. Yet that is what Prez Joe Biden is pulling off this week - for reasons few at the White House seem eager to discuss.Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday. He left Washington again early Wednesday, June 12, to fly to Italy for the annual gathering of the G7 .When Biden looks back at those two round trips - roughly a day and a half of flying, all told - he may remember only what happened in between: the conviction of his only living son, Hunter Biden , on charges of lying to obtain a gun permit.But the two round trips beg the question: Why didn't he just stay in Europe for a couple days? He is, after all, 81, and some of his aides who are half his age were complaining about lost sleep cycles.The White House's explanation for four trans-Atlantic crossings in nine days was simply that Biden had commitments in Washington. But by presidential standards, his public schedule looked light: a lunch with vice-president Kamala Harris and a speech to a gun-safety group. Hunter Biden's trial also loomed over the planning, though it was impossible to know when these trips were planned that the case would go to the jury and a verdict would be rendered in the three days between the D-Day trip and the G7 meeting.But privately, some aides said there were election-year optics to be considered. There was no urgent reason to stay in Europe, and a few down days ""might not look right"", one of Biden's advisers conceded. In any case, no one wanted images of the president on what his political opponents might cast as a European holiday, at least while he is running for re-election.The presidency, of course, is the ultimate work-from-anywhere job. There are instant communications (a White House van, bristling with antennas, travels in every motorcade) and a staff of hundreds ready to cater to every contingency, whether that involves sending off a thank-you note or launching a retaliatory nuclear strike.The intolerance for seeing presidents abroad, save for work, has a long history. Franklin D Roosevelt loved to camp at Campobello Island, in Canada, though as president he kept the visits brief. When Harry S Truman went to Potsdam, Germany, to negotiate with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill about what post-WWII Europe would look like, he stayed for more than two weeks. There were days off from the negotiations, but not for long, and the nearest big city, Berlin, was a bombed wreck. And there was a reminder of the risks of being out of town: Churchill's party lost to Labour during the conference, and he got booted out of office while it was still going on.","Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday.

Blinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-says-some-of-hamas-proposed-changes-to-a-cease-fire-plan-in-gaza-are-workable-and-some-not/articleshow/110945200.cms,"Hamas asks for amendments'

Revenge for slain commander

BEIRUT: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan, some that he said were ""workable"" and some not. He did not spell out what the changes were. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, Blinken said the US and other mediators will keep trying to ""close this deal.""Blinken is in the region to push a cease-fire proposal with global support that has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. The militant group submitted its first official response late Tuesday, requesting ""amendments"" to the deal.The American's comments came as Lebanon's Hezbollah fired a massive barrage of rockets into northern Israel to avenge the killing of a top commander, further escalating regional tensions.Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas, has traded fire with Israel nearly every day since the 8-month-long Israel-Hamas war began and says it will only stop if there is a truce in Gaza. That has raised fears of an even more devastating regional conflagration.Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and the military said that about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon, making it one of the largest attacks since the fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties as some were intercepted while others ignited brush fires.Hamas has expressed support for the broad outline of the deal but wariness over whether Israel would implement its terms.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told the Lebanese news outlet ElNashra that the ""amendments"" requested by the group include guarantees of a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Hamas's official reply to the proposal, which it conveyed to mediators on Tuesday, appeared to be short of outright acceptance but kept negotiations alive.Qatar and Egypt, which have been key mediators alongside the United States, said they were studying it.Blinken is on his eighth visit to the region since the start of the war.The proposal has raised hopes of ending a conflict in which Israel's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and driven some 80 per cent of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the isolated coastal enclave, fueling widespread hunger.Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Hamas is still holding around 120 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead.The proposal announced by Biden calls for a three-phase plan that would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes.Phase one also requires the safe distribution of humanitarian assistance ""at scale throughout the Gaza Strip,"" which Biden said would lead to 600 trucks of aid entering Gaza every day.At the same time, negotiations would be launched over the second phase, which is to bring ""a permanent end to hostilities, in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.""Phase three would launch ""a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased hostages still in Gaza to their families.""The militant group accepted a similar proposal last month that was rejected by Israel.Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies have rejected the latest proposal and have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war leaving Hamas intact. But Netanyahu is also under mounting pressure to accept a deal to bring the hostages back.Thousands of Israelis, including families of the hostages, have demonstrated in favor of the US-backed plan.Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for the killing of Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55. Known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, he is the most senior commander killed since the fighting began eight months ago. The Israeli strike destroyed a house where Abdullah and three other officials were meeting, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, late Tuesday.A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that Abdullah was in charge of a large part of the Lebanon-Israel front, including the area facing the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which Hezbollah has repeatedly attacked in recent days, causing fires in the area.The official, who was not authorized to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abdullah had joined Hezbollah decades ago and took part in attacks against Israeli forces during their 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in May 2000.Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began.Other groups allied with Iran, including powerful militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have also attacked Israeli, US and other targets since the start of the war, often drawing Western retaliation.In April, Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time.US President Joe Biden 's administration has said the best way to calm regional tensions is for Hamas to accept a proposal for a phased cease-fire that it says would end of the war in Gaza and bring about the release of the remaining hostages abducted in Hamas' October 7 attack that ignited the war. The UN Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan on Monday.Biden says it is an Israeli proposal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent conflicting signals, saying Israel remains committed to destroying Hamas.It's unclear how it would do that if the US-backed proposal, which includes an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, is fully implemented.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan.

The judge has been hearing the cases against opposition leader in parliament Omar Ayub and other workers of Imran's PTI party in connection with the May 9, 2023 violence related to attacks on military installations in May last year. Ayub had alleged last week at a hearing that the judge was ""hostage"" of the intelligence agencies.

CJ Ahmad Khan summoned Punjab IGP Usman Anwar on Thursday and asked him why the roads leading to anti-terrorism court (Sargodha), some 200 km from Lahore, were closed by police when the judge refused to meet an ISI officer. The IGP replied: ""The roads were closed as the judge was facing serious threats"". The chief justice reserved his verdict on the alleged harassment of the ATC judge by the ISI.

In March, six judges of the Islamabad high court reached out to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) informing alleged intrusion of intelligence operatives in judicial matters.

The move came as Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb heard multiple pleas filed by the PTI founder and his wife.During the hearing at the Islamabad High Court, Imran Khan's lawyer Salman Akram Raja requested the announcement of the verdict reserved by Judge Arujmand. The lawyer requested the IHC to either hear the appeals itself or transfer them to the additional sessions Judge West.Salman Akram Raja stressed that the court should set a time for the session court to decide on the appeals filed by Imran Khan and his wife.During the hearing, Maneka's lawyer Rizwan Abbasi opposed the transfer of appeals to a sessions judge. Abbasi argued that the administrative orders issued by the court can neither be directly challenged nor indirectly, according to Geo News report.In his petition, Khan had sought the announcement of the district and sessions court's reserved verdict. He also requested the court to hear appeals in the said case.Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had sought a decision on her plea seeking sentence suspension in the sessions court. Last week, Bushra Bibi approached the IHC seeking suspension of her sentence in the iddat case.Earlier in January, Bushra Bibi's ex-husband Khawar Maneka had challenged the couple's marriage and called their marriage fraudulent. He said that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi got married during her iddat (the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death), Geo News reported.In February, a trial court then gave the couple a seven-year sentence and imposed a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 500,000 each on the couple. The couple then filed multiple appeals including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Judge Shahrukh Arjumand had reserved the verdict on the appeals filed by Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi challenging their conviction on May 23, Geo News reported.However, considering Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the IHC, on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

PTI will also respond to its negotiation option.""Gohar said that the party will begin its negotiations after talking to Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai.He said there is an alliance with Achakzai and other parties, and that his party will take them into confidence.""Negotiations can also be held at the alliance level.

The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful.

Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

Some resistance fighters have been injured in these attacks, highlighting the junta's improved proficiency in utilizing UAVs.According to Min Zaw Oo, executive director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security think-tank, the junta began procuring thousands of Chinese commercial UAVs at the start of the year, modifying them to carry locally-manufactured munitions. While the junta has not publicly addressed its recent use of UAVs, regime leader Min Aung Hlaing acknowledged last year that rebels had dropped over 25,000 bombs using drones during a major October offensive on military posts.Despite the junta's acquisition of armed CH-3 UAVs from China around 2013, resistance members report that the military is currently deploying multi-rotor commercial drones, including those designed for agriculture, in their latest sorties. The limited number of junta drones observed on the frontline suggests that the military has not yet deployed all of its newly procured aircraft.As the civil war continues, the resistance appears to have lost its early advantage of being the main fighting force using drones, according to analysts and rebel fighters. The junta's expanding UAV attack fleet is a welcome development for demoralized military forces relying on conscription to replenish shrinking frontline battalions.

""There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.""He added, ""They get their people elected in many different forms- proper candidates, dummy candidates, independent candidates - but all from the same party.""Law minister Anisul Huq said he completely disagreed with Yunus' comments, however.""It's not only I who disagree, but the people of the country will also disagree,"" Huq told Reuters by telephone, calling the remarks an ""insult"" to the people of the country.""Democracy is fully functional in this country,"" he added.Yunus, an economist who won the Nobel for his work on microcredit, was forced out of Grameen Bank in 2011 by Hasina's government, which said he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the South Asian nation killed in an army coup in 1975, along with most of his family. She first became prime minister in 1996.As Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Hasina has been credited with turning around the economy, though critics have also accused her of human rights violations and suppression of dissent.The US state department said January's elections were not free and fair while the British government's foreign office also condemned acts of ""intimidation and violence"".At the time, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) denounced the exercise as a ""sham"" election, calling for its cancellation, Hasina's resignation and the formation of a non-party neutral government to hold a fresh one.Just before the election, a court in Bangladesh had sentenced Yunus to six months in prison for violations of labour law, which he denied.Although he is not in prison after securing bail in that case, Yunus faces more than 100 cases regarding the violations and graft accusations, which he dismissed as ""very flimsy, made-up stories"".Huq denied the accusations against Yunus were false, however, adding, ""He has gone to the highest court of the country, which found there was a case against him.""As an example, Huq cited taxes paid by Yunus after the supreme court ruled against him in a tax-evasion case, but declined comment on others as being sub-judice.Yunus' supporters say Hasina's government has sought to discredit him because he once considered setting up the political party, called ""Citizens' Power"".Hasina, who denies the contention, called Yunus a ""bloodsucker"" of the poor in 2011.""Is it a crime for a citizen to try to make a political party?"" Yunus asked, saying he dropped the idea of such a party after just 10 weeks, on realising that he was not suited to politics.Reviving a competitive political landscape in Bangladesh will be difficult, however, Yunus said.""Restarting will be very painful because we have brought it to a point where it has completely disappeared.""","Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus says.

Law minister Anisul Huq says he completely disagrees with Yunus' comments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110901607,imgsize-637270,width-400,resizemode-4/110901607.jpg"
Three Rohingyas killed in Bangladesh after clash between rival groups over dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/three-rohingyas-killed-in-bangladesh-after-clash-between-rival-groups-over-dominance/articleshow/110896957.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

COX'S BAZAR: At least three Rohingya refugees were killed, and seven others injured following a clash between rival militant groups struggling for control over relief camps in Bangladesh.Bangladesh shelters one million members of the stateless and persecuted Muslim community, the majority of whom arrived after a severe military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.Most of these refugees live in vast, crowded camps. This year, there has been an increase in skirmishes between armed groups, partly due to the forced recruitment of refugees into Myanmar's civil war.On Monday, at least 100 members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army ( ARSA ) attacked a group of refugees conducting a security patrol in a camp located in Cox's Bazar district, according to police.""They cut barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp and launched the attack on Rohingyas who were protecting the camp,"" said Mohammad Iqbal, a commanding officer of the Armed Police Battalion, which is tasked with maintaining security in the camps.""Three Rohingyas were killed and seven were injured. When police came to the spot, ARSA members also attacked police,"" he told AFP, adding that the victims had been variously shot and attacked with knives.A Rohingya community leader in the camps, speaking on condition of anonymity, has said the three slain men were members of the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation ( RSO ).""Murders and gunfights are occurring every day and night in the camp. ARSA killed three RSOs yesterday. No Rohingya are safe here. ARSA and RSO have made the camps hell for the Rohingya refugees,"" he said.Security within the Rohingya camps has been declining since April. Rival Rohingya groups have initiated campaigns to forcibly recruit young men and teenage boys to combat in Myanmar.About 1,500 Rohingya have been coerced from the camps to join the conflict, according to a confidential report circulated among UN agencies last month and viewed by AFP.Worried parents and Rohingya community leaders have organized patrol groups in the camps to prevent recruitment raids.At least 20 Rohingya have died this year in clashes between rival militant groups, as reported by the national daily Prothom Alo.Different Rohingya armed groups are individually gathering troops for Myanmar's military, responsible for their violent expulsion from the country in 2017.These groups argue that the Rohingya must ally with past enemies within the Myanmar army to confront a new threat.The recruits have been sent across the border to engage with the Arakan Army, which seeks greater autonomy in Myanmar's Rakhine state, also home to roughly 600,000 Rohingya.","Bangladesh shelters one million members of the stateless and persecuted Muslim community.
