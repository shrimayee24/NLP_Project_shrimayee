Nepal medic killed in Pahalgam didn’t get time to say he was a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-medic-killed-in-pahalgam-didnt-get-time-to-say-he-was-a-foreigner/articleshow/120592414.cms,"Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag.He was cremated at Triveni Ghat around noon, with hundreds, including local govt officials, gathered for the last rites. Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India.Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep’s home, the neighbourhood had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when a group of men with guns approached. Witnesses later said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot. “He didn’t get the chance to say he was a foreigner,” said Tejulal Neupane , his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. “He had nothing to do with anything.”His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from Uttar Pradesh accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep’s uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar. Butwal mayor Khelraj Pandey, Rupandehi chief district officer Basudev Ghimire , and police chief Ranjit Singh Rathore joined the procession.Sudeep lived in Kalikanagar for most of his life. After his parents, Dhruv Neupane and Reema Pandey, separated, he stayed behind to support his mother. His sister moved to Pokhara after marriage, but Sudeep remained, managing the household finances, arranging care, and eventually becoming its only earning member. He held a public health degree from Dharan and was pursuing further studies in Kathmandu while working part-time on an oral health campaign in rural Nepal.The job did not pay much, but it was steady, and he had grown invested in the work. “He wasn’t just showing up,” said Amrit Bhusal, who runs Modern Samaj Dental, the clinic that had employed him for nearly a year. “He was doing follow-ups. He was tracking cases. He was committed in a way that was unusual.”In Pyuthan, Bhairahawa, and along the outer districts of Rupandehi, his visits became routine. He carried a clipboard and often walked between health posts on foot. When he spoke about public health, his colleagues said, it was in practical terms — transport access, dental hygiene, vaccine follow-up — not in abstract declarations.At home, he was quiet. Neighbours described him as careful and unobtrusive. Rajendra Kumar Acharya, who lives two houses down, remembered a brief conversation before the trip. “He told us he was going to Kashmir. He seemed happy to be taking a break. That’s all.” His 89-year-old grandfather, Khemananda Neupane, learned of the death indirectly. “My wife stopped my prayers,” he said. “She told me something had happened. I didn’t understand at first.”His father, Dhruv Neupane, a teacher at Bhawanipur High School in Butwal-18, was returning from a teachers’ protest in Kathmandu when his phone began to ring. “No one would say it outright,” he said. “Only when I arrived home did I understand what they had been trying to tell me. It doesn’t matter where I live. He was my child.”","Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

Pakistan 'Trained' 2 J&K Locals For Pahalgam Attack, 3 Terrorists Came From Across Border | Report

A man allegedly carrying a cake was spotted entering the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi on Thursday, shortly after India served a persona non grata notice to Pakistani military diplomats in the wake of Pahalgam terror attack.A video doing round on social media, showed the individual being confronted by reporters who questioned the nature of celebrations, refused to comment and hurried past media personnel.Meanwhile, Delhi police removed barricades placed near the Pakistan High Commission.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack , in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","A man allegedly carrying a cake was spotted entering the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi on Thursday.

SRINAGAR: An all-party meeting convened Thursday by Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Pahalgam massacre adopted a resolution condemning the barbaric act and supporting the measures taken by Union govt to bring the perpetrators to justice. The resolution termed the brutal killings an “assault on Kashmiriyat and the idea of India”While expressing shock and grief over the loss of 26 innocent lives in the terror attack , the resolution also hailed the “supreme sacrifice” of pony guide Syed Adil Hussain Shah, and lauded the Kashmiri people for their “extraordinary display of moral and material support to all the tourists” across the Valley.The resolution called upon all sections of society across the country to maintain peace and not give in to provocations, while urging govts of other states and UTs to ensure Kashmiris residing or travelling there were “safeguarded against any form of harassment, discrimination, or intimidation”.At the outset, a two-minute silence was observed by all the participants to pay tributes to the victims.Reading out the resolution at a press conference after the all-party meeting, Omar said: “We unequivocally condemn in the strongest possible terms the heinous, inhumane attack in Pahalgam that targeted and killed innocent civilians. Such cowardly acts of brutality against peaceful citizens have no place in society and are a direct assault on the values of Kashmiriyat and the idea of India, which have long been a symbol of unity, peace and harmony in the region.”“We stand unwavering in our commitment to support all efforts in bringing these perpetrators to justice. In doing so, we affirm that no act of terror can ever weaken our resolve or extinguish our indomitable spirit,” the resolution said.Extending condolences to the families that have suffered loss, the resolution also saluted the “valour and selflessness” of the slain pony guide. “He is a true face of Kashmiriyat and Kashmir hospitality,” Omar said.The Kashmiri people’s “resolute unity in condemning the recent attack” and the spontaneous, peaceful demonstrations across J&K exemplified their “unwavering commitment to peace, communal harmony and the rule of law”, and reaffirmed their “collective resolve to foster mutual respect, uphold constitutional values, and work collaboratively for the prosperity and stability of J&K”, the resolution further stated.",An all-party meeting convened by Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Pahalgam massacre adopted a resolution condemning the barbaric act.

"Students SEVIS Record Restored: All 133 international students, including many Indians, win lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-133-international-students-including-many-indians-who-filed-a-lawsuit-get-their-sevis-records-restored/articleshow/120562167.cms,"File photo

The Trump administration has followed the orders of the US district court (northern district of Georgia) and reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.As reported by TOI on April 20, the court had issued issued a temporary restraining order, requiring department of homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactive to March 31, 2025. US govt agencies were ordered to file a notice of compliance of the reinstatement by Tuesday evening.Charles Kuck, who represented the students, many of them Indians, said: “All students are now reinstated.” They can now continue to study or work under the optional practical training (OPT) programme. The next hearing is slated in the coming days.In some, but not all of the 133 cases, the state department has revoked the student’s visa. The revocation of an F-1 visa (which is granted for duration of status) does not necessarily impact the person’s lawful presence in the country. As such, plaintiffs contended it is the SEVIS registration termination that has rendered them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation.Increasingly, in the courts, the US agencies are taking a stand that SEVIS termination does not result in irreparable harm. Based solely on their latest contention, if a SEVIS record is terminated a student can continue with studies in the US. However, SEVIS termination notices received by students from their designated school officials ask them to self deport at the earliest as there is no grace period following a SEVIS termination. Further, it automatically terminates the work authorisation granted for an OPT programme .In a press conference American Immigration Lawyers Association 's President-Elect Jeff Joseph said, “We believe SEVIS termination does impact the status of international students. Thus, most of the lawsuits being filed are not challenging the actual visa revocation, but SEVIS termination.” He said US agencies are increasingly pointing out in court that SEVIS termination is just a credential revocation, it has no underlying impact on legal status. But this is directly contrary to their own outward facing guidance on their website, in response to inquiries as well as their own policy-guidance and training materials for DSOs.“It is our hope that if govt takes the position SEVIS termination has no impact on status, they revise their guidance... so that the kids can go back to school, to work and do what they intended to do, which is to come here and educate themselves and use that education to benefit all of us here in the US,” he added.","The Trump administration has reinstated the SEVIS records of all 133 students who had filed this lawsuit.

Taylor Swift and Hugh Jackman named as possible witnesses in escalating Hollywood legal drama

Taylor Swift could potentially be drawn into a legal battle between her close friend Blake Lively and actor-director Justin Baldoni. While she hasn't been officially subpoenaed yet, Baldoni’s legal team has suggested that Swift might be called as a witness due to her alleged involvement in private conversations related to the case.According to recent reports, Taylor Swift and Hugh Jackman are also expected to be subpoenaed as witnesses in the intensifying legal dispute involving Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds.The lawsuit stems from Blake Lively’s accusations against Justin Baldoni during the production of the film It Ends With Us, in which both actors were involved. Lively claims that Baldoni sexually harassed her and attempted to damage her professional reputation.Baldoni, however, has denied the allegations and has filed a countersuit for defamation, accusing Lively of making false claims to harm his image. Hugh Jackman, a close friend of Reynolds and Lively, is reportedly being considered as a witness due to his proximity to the couple and possible knowledge of private conversations relevant to the case.Taylor Swift’s name came into the spotlight after leaked messages showed that Lively reportedly referred to Swift and Reynolds as her ""dragons"" a nod to Game of Thrones that symbolized their fierce loyalty and unwavering support, much like powerful guardians ready to defend her.According to the texts, Swift and Reynolds may have helped Lively navigate creative disagreements with Baldoni, potentially influencing some of the key moments that led to the current conflict.Given this connection, Baldoni’s legal team has suggested that Swift’s testimony might provide insights into Lively’s claims and intentions. However, Swift has no official ties to the film and is said to be uncomfortable with the idea of becoming involved in the dispute. Sources close to her report that she has been distancing herself from the controversy and wants to avoid any formal participation in the legal proceedings.The situation has also created tension behind the scenes, with Baldoni’s team accusing Lively’s legal side of using underhanded tactics and filing the case quietly to manipulate public perception. The case has become increasingly public as more private messages and footage are released, with both sides trying to protect their reputations.The trial is scheduled for March 2026, and it remains unclear whether Swift will actually be subpoenaed or choose to speak publicly on the matter. For now, she appears to be keeping her distance, though the legal teams may push for her involvement if they believe her testimony is crucial.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s love story in trouble after Kayla Nicole sparks cheating scandal In the meantime, this case continues to draw media attention due to the high-profile names involved and the serious nature of the allegations.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s former cricketer Mohammad Hafeez expressed deep sorrow over the tragic terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, by posting on X (formerly Twitter): “Sad & heartbroken #PahalgamTerroristAttack.”His message, though brief, resonated widely, underlining the immense human cost of such violence and the collective grief it triggers across borders.The heinous attack, described as one of the deadliest in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing, claimed the lives of at least 28 civilians and left more than 20 others injured. It has shocked the nation and reignited urgent calls for united efforts to eliminate terrorism.In the wake of the tragedy, the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police, and central security agencies have launched an intensive manhunt to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Shah, in particular, delivered a powerful statement asserting the nation's unwavering resolve against terrorism.“Bharat will not bend to terror. The culprits of this dastardly terror attack will not be spared,” Shah said after laying wreaths on the bodies of the victims.Posting on X, he shared, “With a heavy heart, paid last respects to the deceased of the Pahalgam terror attack .”In another message, Shah added, “Every Indian feels the pain of those who lost their loved ones in the terrorist attack and... words cannot express this sadness.” He assured the nation: “These terrorists killing innocent people will not be spared.”As grief grips the nation, such messages serve as powerful reminders of resilience, empathy, and unity in the face of terror.","Pakistan’s former cricketer Mohammad Hafeez expressed deep sorrow over the tragic terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.

'One of them kicked me hard to see if I was still alive: Wife's terrifying escape from the Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/one-of-them-kicked-me-hard-to-see-if-i-was-still-alive-wifes-terrifying-escape-from-the-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120604065.cms,"One of them kicked me hard to see if I was still alive: Jennifer

INDORE: ""There was the whisper of wind rustling through the trees, the echo of gunfire still ringing in my ears, and unbearable cold. I opened my eyes and the first thing I saw was my husband - slumped against a tree, motionless. Blood had soaked through his hair and was trailing down his shoulder. A worm was crawling across his skin. I wanted to scream, to run to him, to hold him - but I couldn't move. The cold had numbed my limbs and frozen my voice...""Jennifer Nathaniel closed her eyes and shuddered. Her husband, Sushil, had been put to rest. As if in slow motion, the horror of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed Sushil and 25 others comes back to her in freeze-frame detail. Perhaps it's her mind's way of dealing with the shock.Like the terror attack, Jennifer's emotions and the horrific flashbacks are beyond her control. ""Palestinia ke baare mein pata hai na (you know about Palestine, right)?"" two gunmen asked Sushil on learning he was a Christian. Then, they shot him. Barely had she taken in the shock of seeing her husband's body that two terrorists appeared, surveying the dead, she recalls.I quickly shut my eyes and held my breath. One of them kicked me, hard, to see if I was still alive. I didn't flinch. I couldn't. I turned my head ever so slightly once they moved away and saw a young girl sprawled lifeless against a nearby tree. Just behind my husband was another man - also dead - propped against the trunk of a tree.""Jennifer tried to move toward Sushil again, but couldn't. ""That's when I realized I was covered with a sweater - his sweater. Even in the chaos, even after being shot, he had managed to throw it over me,"" she said.""I saw three people nearby - two in normal clothes and one dressed like a Kashmiri. They were taking selfies with the dead bodies,"" she said.""Soon after, the gunmen came back. They kicked me again to check if I was alive. I closed my eyes, held my breath, and lay completely still, pretending to be dead. Once they were convinced everyone was dead, they left. I don't know when they shot my husband. They had shot everyone in the head,"" Jennifer recalled.She lay there, motionless, until the Army arrived. ""I didn't trust them at first - they were in similar uniforms, and I feared they might be part of the attackers and so I again pretended to be dead. Eventually, I raised my hand. One of them ran to me and sent out a wireless message that I was alive and needed help,"" the Indorean said.""I was not in my senses. I kept begging him to save my husband. I kept asking everyone, 'What is Kalma?' But no one answered. They helped me, but no one went to my husband.""As she was brought down the mountain, she said that all she could see were dead bodies and pools of blood. ""Even now, when I close my eyes, I see those bodies,"" she said, with a shiver.When they had started for Baisaran valley around 11am that day, Akansha stayed back as she was not feeling well. The driver suggested a nice place to leave her and Sushil dropped her there and he, Jennifer and their son Austen set off on ponies.""It was such a beautiful day, I had gathered a lot of courage to sit on the pony, but I was scared because it was my first time. The path was very dangerous, but I still rode. We made it to the top. That's when Sushil asked me if I wanted to try the ropeway. Without hesitation, I said yes. He was so surprised and happy - he knew how fearful I usually am. I bought the ropeway ticket, which cost Rs 350. He ran around excitedly, taking videos of me,"" Jennifer said.They were about to leave when he said he needed to go to the washroom. ""I told him to go alone, but he insisted I come along. Austen went towards the ponies clicking pictures and waited for us at a distance. We went towards the washroom. There were at least 30 people around, washing mud off their shoes under a tap,"" she recalled.Just as he came out of the washroom, the couple heard a loud bang. At first, they thought the ropeway cable had snapped or a gear level had broken.""But when we looked toward the gate, we saw someone had been shot. And then gunfire broke out - everywhere. The attackers were shooting indiscriminately. There was silence, punctuated by gunshots. Bodies started falling all around us. We hid behind the washroom and used a narrow passage to escape through the fence into the forest,"" said the survivor.""We all said to each other, 'Run, we won't survive if we stay.' My husband was desperately trying to find a phone to call for help, but he didn't have a postpaid phone. I had given both my phone and Austen's to our daughter earlier, so we couldn't reach him either. My husband was calling out for our son, asking if anyone had seen him. The crowd told everyone to scatter and run in different directions,"" she said.""Suddenly, my husband pushed me behind a tree, trying to protect me. The terrorists came straight at us and two of them pointed rifles at us. They told Sushil to recite the Kalma. He said, 'I'm a Christian, I don't know it.' One of the attackers said, ""Here, only the Kalma will be spoken. You know about Palestine right? (Yaha bas Kalma hi chalega. Palestinia ke baare mein pata hai na?) Then he fired... I fainted at the sound of the gunshot,"" said Jennifer.Austen was waiting at the gate but when the firing started, pony handlers took him down safely. He saw the first person being shot dead and ran for his life.Later, after being reunited with Akansha, Jennifer asked the Armymen about Austen. ""Just then, one of them got a call and he said, 'Her husband has been shot.' That's when I lost control. I nearly fell out of the vehicle. My daughter ran to pull me back. She fell face-first while running and fractured her leg.""There should have been better security, she said.""This isn't the first time something like this has happened. There should have been Army presence in such a vast area. There should have been proper security in Kashmir . These terrorists don't deserve to be jailed - they deserve the harshest punishment. I saw small children being attacked. And those two young attackers? They were taking selfies with the bodies - posing and clicking photos amid all that bloodshed.

Houthi rebels have shot down 7 US Reaper drones worth $200 million in recent weeks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/houthi-rebels-have-shot-down-7-us-reaper-drones-worth-200-million-in-recent-weeks/articleshow/120602568.cms,"In this photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows a burning oil tanker after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.(Credits AP)

WASHINGTON: Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven US Reaper drones in less than six weeks, a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the Iran-backed militants.According to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week - suggesting the militants' targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.The US has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the US has struck more than 800 Houthi targets. ""These strikes have destroyed multiple command and control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,"" Eastburn said.Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation. The official noted that the increase in US strikes can add to the risk to aircraft, but said the US will take every measure possible to protect troops, equipment and interests in the region. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to comment on sensitive military issues.The sophisticated drones, built by General Atomics, cost about $30 million each, and generally fly at altitudes of more than 40,000 feet (12,100 meters). Houthis leaders have consistently touted the strikes in public statements. One of the defense officials said the US lost Reaper drones on March 31 and on April 3, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 22.US senators, meanwhile, are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by the American strikes in Yemen. Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia wrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday questioning whether the Trump administration is ""abandoning the measures necessary to meet its obligations to reducing civilian harm.""Specifically, they questioned reports that US strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.""Military leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within US operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do,"" their letter said.In addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at US military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They haven't hit any.The US has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.Hegseth decided in March to beef up the Navy warship presence in the Middle East, ordering the USS Harry S. Truman to extend its deployment there, as the USS Carl Vinson steamed toward the area.The Truman, along with two of the destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is now in the Red Sea. And the Vinson, along with two destroyers and a cruiser, is in the Gulf of Aden.The third destroyer assigned to the Truman is in the Mediterranean Sea. And two other US Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea, but aren't part of the Truman's group.Hegseth is weighing whether to grant a request by US Central Command to once again extend the Truman's deployment. A decision to do that could keep the Truman and at least some of its strike group in the region for several more weeks.It has been rare in recent years for the US to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo.Last year, the Biden administration ordered the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time, as US warships waged the most intense running sea battle since World War II.Prior to that it had been years since the US had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.The Houthis have been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.","Three of the drones were shot down in the past week - suggesting the militants' targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved.

Syed Adil Hussain Shah’s house in Hapatnar, a sleepy village around 35 km from Pahalgam, is nearly 40 years old and made of mud, kutcha bricks, and wood.

HAPATNAR (ANANTNAG): In the remote Baisaran valley of Pahalgam in Kashmir's Anantnag district, Syed Adil Hussain Shah 's phone kept ringing incessantly on Tuesday. His father, Syed Haidar Shah, was calling to instruct him to buy some rice - a routine request in their household where every day was a struggle against poverty. But the 30-year-old, a pony guide at Baisaran, popularly known as ""Mini Switzerland,"" never picked up.It was not until the family reached out to the local police that the shocking truth came to light - Adil had been killed, the only local casualty in the Pahalgam terrorist attack. As the family lost the lone breadwinner, a village committee is providing basic food to the family and visitors.As the family lost the lone breadwinner, a village committee is providing basic food to the family and visitors.When TOI reached Adil’s house on Thursday at Hapatnar, a sleepy village around 35 km from Pahalgam, relatives and villagers were mourning his death. The nondescript village had become a visiting place for top leaders of the state and national media.On Wednesday, CM Omar Abdullah attended his funeral.Dr Sameer Siddiqui, head of Khanqah-e-Hyderi, Aishmuqam shrine, Anantnag, while visiting the family on Thursday, said that Adil is the face of new Kashmir. By making a sacrifice for the tourists, he proved to the entire country and the world that this is Kashmiriyat—sacrificing life for guests, he added.“I am shattered by the loss of my son who was taking care of the entire family like a pillar, but I am also proud knowing he gave his life to save others. ‘Vo khuda ka bheja hua Farishta thaa’ (he was an angel sent by GOD),” said Adil’s father, Haider, as tears streamed down his face.Sharing details of the illfated day, Haider Shah said Adil was the only breadwinner for the family. On that day, his mother, Babyjan, told him that there was nothing to eat at home and told him to ask Adil to bring some rice in the evening. According to him, on several occasions the family had nothing to eat for a second meal of the day.“I started calling him at around 2 pm, but he didn’t take the call. Realising he must be busy with tourists, I asked my younger son, Naushad, in the evening to speak to Adil. When no response was received, Naushad went to the nearby police post, which informed us about the incident at around 7 pm,” Haider added.The poor financial condition of the family could be gauged from the fact that they were still living in a 40-year-old house made of mud, kutcha bricks, and wood. The total land owned by the family is around 2 Kanal, including the residence and agricultural land. The family is entirely dependent on labour work.His father added that immediately after completing Class XII, Adil asked him to rest at home and chose to become a pony guide in Pahalgam for tourists as well as during the Amarnath Yatra. Naushad, who also does labour work, said that his brother used to leave home at 8 am and come back around 7 pm. He used to earn Rs 300 per round for taking tourists on two ponies of a local contractor for one round from Pahalgam to Baisaran. At most, he was earning Rs 600 in a day and sometimes nothing.Naushad added that when he reached Srinagar hospital to collect Adil’s body after the postmortem, one of the female tourists, who had also lost her family member, told him that he tried his best to save them by snatching a gun from the terrorists. “When we checked his body, it was found that he was shot at close range. There was a hole in his neck, bullets on his chest, and a portion of one of his shoulders was mutilated by bullet injuries. Injuries to his fingers suggested he might have tried to grab the barrel of the firing gun,” Naushad added.Haider said that several people visited them, but no instant financial help has been provided to them. He added that as of now, the family is being taken care of by the village committee but is not aware of what will happen to the family after Fatiha Khawani (last memorial prayers).Adil’s wife, Nazim, has been living separately at her father’s house after the couple lost their girl child immediately after birth.","Syed Adil Hussain Shah was the only local casualty in the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Hegseth reportedly has unsecured internet line in Pentagon office for Signal

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth used a commercial internet line—known in IT terms as a “dirty line”—installed in his Pentagon office to bypass standard defence department security systems and access encrypted messaging platforms like Signal from a personal computer, source told news agency Associated Press.The ""dirty line"" was specifically used to access websites and applications blocked on the Pentagon’s usual networks: SiprNet (for classified data) and NiprNet (for unclassified but secure communication), reported ABC news. Pentagon rules prohibit any unauthorised electronic devices in the defence secretary’s office due to the risk of spyware and hacking.Earlier this week, reports revealed that Hegseth shared sensitive details about military air strikes in Yemen with close personal contacts through a private Signal group. The group, created by him in January before his confirmation, included his wife Jennifer (a former Fox News producer), his brother Phil, and lawyer Tim Parlatore, who also advises him at the Pentagon. The Times said Hegseth shared information such as flight timings of F/A-18 Hornets targeting Houthi rebels on March 15.This was the second such case involving Hegseth. Last month, The Atlantic revealed that its editor-in-chief had accidentally been added to another Signal chat about the same Yemen operation.Back in 2016, Hegseth had criticised Hillary Clinton on Fox News for using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of State, calling it a “fireable” and “criminal” offence for anyone with a top secret clearance.","Hegseth reportedly has unsecured internet line in Pentagon office for Signal.

Trump pardons ex-Las Vegas councilwoman Michele Fiore after fraud conviction

US president Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Michele Fiore, a prominent Nevada Republican convicted of federal wire fraud. Fiore was awaiting sentencing after being found guilty in October 2024 of misusing funds meant to honour a fallen police officer. Prosecutors said she diverted more than $70,000 raised for a statue to cover personal expenses, including plastic surgery, rent, and her daughter's wedding.Fiore, a former Las Vegas city councilwoman and state legislator, has long been a public supporter of Trump. She ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer in 2022 and was later appointed as a judge in Nye County, Nevada. Despite her conviction, she was elected last year to complete the term of a judge who had passed away, but was later suspended without pay due to her legal troubles.In a Facebook post on Thursday, Fiore thanked Trump for the pardon and claimed that she had been the target of a decade-long campaign by the US government and select media outlets. The White House confirmed the pardon but gave no explanation for the decision, reported news agency Associated Press.The move has drawn criticism from Democrats in Nevada. Hilary Barrett, Executive Director of the state’s Democratic Party, called it a “slap in the face” to law enforcement, accusing Trump of disregarding the seriousness of the crime.Fiore plans to return to the bench next week, though the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline has not yet issued a formal update on her suspension status.Fiore’s legal troubles began in 2021 when FBI agents searched her Las Vegas home. Her conviction included six counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She faced the possibility of decades in prison before Trump’s pardon overturned the verdict.","Trump pardons ex-Las Vegas councilwoman Michele Fiore after fraud conviction.

The US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce deflected questions about India-Pakistan border tensions following the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam which claimed 26 lives on April 22.During Thursday's press briefing, Bruce declined to comment directly on border tensions, referring instead to previous statements made by senior US officials.""I am not going to be remarking on it. I appreciate this, and perhaps, we will come back to you with another subject. I will say nothing more on that situation. The President and the Secretary have said things, as have the deputy secretary; they have made their positions clear. I will not continue with something of that manner,"" Bruce said.The Pahalgam attack, one of the deadliest since the 2019 Pulwama incident, prompted strong responses from US leadership.

Vice President JD Vance also reached out to PM Modi, reiterating US solidarity with India and offering assistance in counterterrorism efforts.In a swift response, India has taken multiple diplomatic and security steps. After a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by PM Modi, India declared Pakistani defence advisors in New Delhi as Persona Non Grata and withdrew its own from Islamabad. Both countries will also reduce their High Commission staff by nearly half by 1 May.Other measures from India include closing the Attari Integrated Check Post, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and cancelling visa exemptions for Pakistani nationals under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme.

A public funeral Mass will be held in front of St. Peter's Basilica, presided over by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals.The funeral will be more modest than rites for past pontiffs: Francis last year simplified the rules around papal funerals, with changes that include using only one wooden coffin instead of three.After the Mass, Francis' body will be interred in the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, where seven other popes are buried.Francis wrote in his will that he wanted his ""last earthly journey to end at this very ancient Marian shrine.""

Poll Should India reconsider its treaties with Pakistan following the attack? No, treaties should remain intact Yes, it’s necessary

Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday. Most of the victims were tourists.Taking to X, Sunak wrote, “The barbaric attack in Pahalgam has stolen the lives of newlyweds, children, and families simply seeking joy. Our hearts break for them. To those mourning – know that the UK stands with you in sorrow and solidarity. Terror will never win. We grieve with India.”The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Gunmen opened fire near a popular tourist meadow close to Pahalgam town, in what has become the worst attack in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.Global leaders including US president Donald Trump have voiced their condemnation and support for India. Trump called the attack “deeply disturbing” and said the United States stood firmly with India in its fight against terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned early from a visit to Saudi Arabia, chaired a high-level security meeting in Delhi.

Ex judge, wife arrested by ICE in Las Cruces

Former Dona Ana County magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy, were arrested on Thursday following a raid by federal agents at their Las Cruces home after it was discovered that they had allegedly harboured Cristhian Ortega-Lopez , a suspected member of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua.Cano, who resigned in March, was also permanently barred from holding any judicial office in New Mexico by the state’s supreme court.According to Fox News, court documents reveal Ortega-Lopez unlawfully entered the US in December 2023, and was initially hired by Nancy Cano to carry out home repairs. He later moved into the Cano family’s guesthouse.During a subsequent investigation, authorities discovered gang-related clothing, tattoos, voicemails, and text messages linking Ortega-Lopez to the Tren de Aragua gang . Additionally, social media posts showed Ortega-Lopez posing with firearms, some of which he claimed were owned by the Cano family’s daughter, April Cano.Ortega-Lopez now faces federal charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm, with a possible sentence of up to 15 years in prison if convicted.Venezuelan immigrants have gained significant attention following the Trump administration's designation of the Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organisation. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president to deport or detain citizens of an enemy nation during wartime.Trump has sent two planeloads of suspected Tren de Aragua members to an El Salvador prison, triggering a legal standoff. The US supreme court lifted a lower court's ban on these deportations on April 7.","Ex judge, wife arrested by ICE in Las Cruces following raid by federal agents.

'Time for you to leave': Why legal US citizens have been receiving this mail from DHS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/time-for-you-to-leave-why-legal-us-citizens-have-been-receiving-this-mail-from-dhs/articleshow/120595788.cms,"The DHS said these people are receiving the mail because immigrants must have used their mail for administrative records.

Several US citizens , legally staying in the country, received notices from the Department of Homeland Security asking them to leave the country or else be subjected to potential law enforcement actions. The DHS clarified that it was sent to many by mistake. “It is time for you to leave the United States,” read an email sent to Los Angeles immigration lawyer Harriet Steele, who was born in California. “Do not attempt to remain in the United States–the federal government will find you.”DHS clarified that Steele received the message because her address was linked to a group of more than 900,000 people who were allowed into the country on a two-year work visa which means these people provided her email though Steele said she does not represent anyone.“If a non-personal email—such as an American citizen contact—was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” a DHS spokesperson said. “CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”""To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege — not a right,"" the officials added. ""We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.""“The Trump administration operates, in many ways, on a mix of cruelty and incompetence. It’s hard to know what the exact process was by which I happened to receive that email in the middle of the night, East Coast time,” Steele said.This was not a one-off case. Lise Anderson, a doctor from Cromwell, Connecticut, recently disclosed that she received the mail that asked her to leave the country. ""The language seemed pretty threatening to whomever it might actually apply to,"" she said.Nicole Micheroni, a Massachusetts attorney, also got the email. “At first I thought it was for a client, but I looked really closely and the only name on the email was mine,” she told NBC in Boston. “So it said my parole status had been terminated and I should leave the country within seven days. [It was] probably, hopefully, sent to me in error. But it’s a little concerning these are going out to US citizens.""","Several US citizens received notices from the Department of Homeland Security asking them to leave the country or else be subjected to potential law enforcement actions.

Trump told reporters his country would have a ""fair deal with China,"" adding that ""everything's active"" when asked if Washington was talking to Beijing.

""China and the US have not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, calling reports of such information ""false news"". But Trump refuted Chinese claims. ""They had a meeting this morning,"" Trump told reporters, declining to say to whom he was referring. ""It doesn't matter who 'they' is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we've been meeting with China.""China's commerce ministry spokesperson He Yadong, meanwhile, said on Thursday that the US should remove all ""unilateral tariff measures"" against China ""if it truly wanted"" to solve the trade issue. ""The person who tied the bell must untie it,"" he said.
