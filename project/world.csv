'Have expressed concerns directly to Indian govt'

NEW DELHI: The United States on Tuesday said that they believed ""India has ability to"" urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""end the brutal and unprovoked war with Ukraine"".White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about Indian prime minister visiting Russia, said ""We believe India's long-standing relationship with Russia gives it the ability to urge President Putin, to end his brutal war, an unprovoked war in Ukraine...India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in full and frank dialogue, including their relationship with Russia and we've talked about this before.It's critical that all countries, including India, support efforts to realize an enduring and just peace when it comes to Ukraine. It is for President Putin to end. President Putin started the war, and he can end the war...""This came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Russia for two-day official trip to Russia and met President Vladimir Putin.Earlier the State department have also expressed concerns and said that they directly talked to the Indian government about the energy and oil agreements between India and Russia.Responding to a question asked by a reporter about the concerns around India and Russia's continued agreements on energy and oil, State department spokesperson Matthew Miller in a press conference said, ""So, as I said yesterday, we have been quite clear about our concerns about India’s relationship with Russia. We have expressed those privately, directly to the Indian Government and continue to do so, and that hasn’t changed.""During the meeting, both the leaders assessed the multi-faceted mutually beneficial India-Russia relations that span all possible areas of cooperation including political and strategic, military and security, trade and investment, energy, science and technology, nuclear, space, cultural, education and humanitarian cooperation. It was noted with satisfaction that both Sides are actively exploring new avenues for cooperation while further strengthening cooperation in the traditional areas.On Monday also, the US has called upon India to convey a clear message to Moscow that any resolution to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine must adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, which safeguard the territorial integrity of all member states, including Ukraine.Responding to questions regarding Modi's visit to Moscow, Miller said that India is a strategic partner with whom the US engages in open and honest dialogue, including concerns about India's relationship with Russia.""We did just see Modi, like (Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor) Orban, meet with (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy. We thought that was an important step to take. And we would urge India, as we do any country when it engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN charter, that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty,"" Miller said.Miller stated that he would closely examine Prime Minister Modi 's public statements to ascertain the topics discussed during the visit.Meanwhile, on Tuesday's press briefing, another reporter also raised question on PM Modi's visit to Russia.Calling Putin ""bloody criminal,"" the reporter asked, ""How do you view the Modi-Putin hugging chemistry, as President Zelenskyy has seriously objected, saying it’s a huge disappointment that the leader of the world’s largest democracy hugs a bloody criminal in Moscow? This is a devastating blow to peace efforts. Will this create any impact on your trusted and strategic partnership with India?""Miller said that the US continued to urge India, to support efforts to realize an enduring and just peace in Ukraine based on the principles of the UN Charter, based on upholding Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty. ""And that will continue to be what we will engage with India about,"" he added.","White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about Indian prime minister visiting Russia, said ""We believe India's long-standing relationship with Russia gives it the ability to urge President Putin to end his brutal war"" This came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Russia for two-day official trip to Russia and met President Vladimir Putin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111620472,imgsize-48392,width-400,resizemode-4/111620472.jpg"

MEERUT/NEW DELHI: A second-year BA student of Delhi University 's School of Open Learning was allegedly abducted from near his home in northeast Delhi, taken to Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh and beaten to death on Saturday. The family accused of killing the boy, Himanshu Sharma, claimed he had raped their 19-year-old daughter and had been blackmailing her. The boy's mother refuted the charges.Police have filed an FIR against seven people.The mother of the 20-year-old man , Rajni Sharma, said, ""The allegations are a lie. There was no woman involved."" His uncle, Anil Kumar Sharma, added, ""Himanshu received a call from the girl's phone on Saturday. Once he left home, four to five of her family members abducted him to Baghpat, killed him.""While Baghpat Kotwali circle officer Harish Bhadauria confirmed the arrest of two in the case, NP Singh, ASP, Baghpat, said, ""In her complaint, the girl's mother claimed her daughter was being blackmailed by Himanshu after he had raped her.""The girl confided in her brother, who stays in a village in Baghpat. The brother and some relatives reached Delhi, lured the youth with a message from the woman's phone, abducted him and brought him to Baghpat. They intended to teach him a lesson, but the beating went too far,"" said ASP Baghpat.The FIR accessed by TOI lists seven members of the girl's family, including her mother. They have been booked under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita's sections 140 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder or for ransom etc), 103 (1) (murder).For the past 12 years, Rajni had been raising her two children, Himanshu and his younger sister, on her own after her husband abandoned the family. She runs a small grocery shop and stitches clothes to make ends meet in northeast Delhi's New Usmanpur. Himanshu's mother claimed that feeling a sense of unease around 5pm on Saturday, after her son had left home after being ""invited to a birthday party"", she called Himanshu, only to find his phone switched off. ""I waited for him until around 10pm and then alerted my relatives about my missing son,"" said Rajni.

""The woman told me that if I wanted to see my son again, I should accompany her.""The woman took Rajni to a forest in Baghpat. ""We saw a car bearing Delhi number plate there,"" Rajni claimed. ""My son was in the car with blood spattered everywhere."" She was preparing to take her son to hospital when a police control room van arrived and nabbed two of the accused.Asked whether Himanshu was in a relationship with the girl as alleged by the accused, the Sharma family insisted they weren't aware of such a thing.

Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case: Juhu bar's license suspended for serving liquor to 23-year-old accused Mihir Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-bmw-hit-and-run-case-juhu-bars-license-suspended-for-serving-liquor-to-23-year-old-accused-mihir-shah/articleshow/111613780.cms,"MUMBAI: The state excise administration has suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar that served hard liquor to Mihir Shah , who had not yet attained the age of 25 years. This is a basic criterion for serving or drinking whisky, rum, vodka, or similar Indian-made foreign liquors (IMFLs) in the state. The bar premises have been sealed until the next hearing.According to excise officials, Mihir, who is 23-years-old, is the culprit in the Worli hit-and-run case.The excise department also found various irregularities with the bar, named Don Giovanni Restaurant (Jobel Hospitalities Pvt Ltd bearing license number FL3,1489), aside from serving liquor to the underage Shah. Interestingly, on the cash memo or receipt, the bar was named Vice-Global Tapas Bar , located on Juhu Tara Road opposite Juhu Church Road.Following the Worli hit-and-run, this is the first action taken by the excise department, with more likely to follow. After the Porsche mishap in Pune, which killed two young students due to a drunk minor, around 60 bars across the Mumbai metropolitan region were closed for 5 to 10 days as punishment for not following closure timings, offering liquor to underage patrons, and not issuing a day's drinking permit to them. This action was part of the license suspension punishment.A notice issued by the suburban district collector to the Juhu bar on behalf of the state excise revealed that during interrogation, it was found that Dhruv Jawahar Dedhiya and three others, including Shah, had entered the bar premises and were served hard liquor. Mihir, son of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah, has been prima facie found responsible for ramming his BMW into a couple's bike, killing a woman who was thrown a considerable distance from the accident spot due to the impact of his car.It may be mentioned here that post-Porsche incident in Pune, the state excise commissioner, Vijay Suryawanshi, had issued stringent directives to all bars and liquor shops across the state to install CCTVs to monitor their entrances and counters in real-time for underage customers and closure timings by state excise officials. However, the monitoring and vigilance of all the bars and shops in the city and the state seem to be far from meeting expectations.The license of the Juhu bar where Mihir had liquor has been suspended until the next hearing before the suburban collector on July 19, said excise officials. Other irregularities found in the investigations by the excise police included selling liquor to non-drinking permit holders in non-permitted areas, non-submission of licensed premises for inspection, mixing the permitted liquor serving area with the non-permitted restaurant zone, discrepancies in the liquor stock permitted versus non-permitted, lack of a liquor transport license for a certain amount of liquor stock, and wrongly naming the bar as Vice Global Tapas Bar on the receipts or cash memos. A hearing on the notice issued to the bar has been scheduled for July 19, and until then, bar operations have been sealed, said excise officials.","State excise administration has suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar.

Heart bleeds when innocent kids die in war: PM Modi to Putin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-bleeds-when-innocent-kids-die-in-war-pm-modi-to-putin/articleshow/111616599.cms,"A day after his hug of President Vladimir Putin sparked outrage in the West, PM Narendra Modi rapped Putin publicly as he told him peace talks or conflict resolution under the shadow of guns can’t be successful, underlining the need for an immediate ceasefire . Significantly, Modi also vented the global community’s anger over a Russian missile strike on Ukraine ’s largest children hospital on the day he landed in Moscow for his first visit to Russia in 5 years.However, as he raised concerns about the impact of the conflict on the Global South, the Indian PM also softened his message by saying he had heard Putin’s ""frank"" views on peace and it had inspired hope in him.Modi’s remarks before Putin followed an unprecedented blowback from Ukraine and the US to his embrace of Putin, with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, describing it as a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts on a day the children's hospital was attacked. The State Department too said it had raised concerns with India about Russia-India ties and that it wanted Modi to ask Putin to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.""Your Excellency, let's take war , any conflict or terrorist acts. Any person who believes in humanity feels pain when people die, and especially when innocent children die. When we feel such pain, the heart simply explodes, and I had the opportunity to talk about these issues with you yesterday,'' Modi told Putin in the Kremlin, speaking in the presence of reporters and just before the official summit talks.""As a friend, I have always told you that peace is essential for our future generations. But I also know that no solution can be found on a battlefield. Solutions and peace talks will not be successful under the shadow of guns, bombs and bullets. We must find a way to peace through dialogue,"" Modi told Putin, adding fresh ideas and a new thinking had emerged from his talks with the Russian president on Monday.While reiterating all possible support and contribution for any peace effort, Modi said he wanted to assure both Russia and the world that India is in favour of peace.Modi’s comments about children are of particular significance as Zelenskyy had used the attack on the hospital – although Russia has denied any role in it - to attack the Indian PM. ""It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,"" he had said in a post on X. Foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra later said Modi was very ""categorical"" in expressing concern at the loss of lives in the attacks on Monday, particularly of children.According to Indian government sources, that there can’t be a solution on the battlefield was Modi’s overriding message to Putin, like ""this isn’t the era of war"" remark before the Russian president in Samarkand in 2022.Putin said in his own public remarks he appreciated Modi’s efforts to find ways to resolve the crisis through peaceful means. Modi’s emphasis on peace talks sans violence is also important as it doubles down on the international community’s call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. India remains the only major country, apart from China, to have not condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine.That Modi was looking to soothe frayed nerves in the West was obvious when he said the entire world was focused on the meeting and was drawing different meanings from it. The PM’s remarks before Putin seemed aimed at correcting the imbalance, as perceived by the West, in India’s position following its decision to skip ministerial-level participation in the Swiss peace summit and its refusal to endorse a joint declaration underlining Ukraine’s territorial integrity as the basis for any peace process.The State Department had, in fact, said before the summit it was looking forward to Modi’s public remarks to see what he was going to talk about with Putin and it had made clear directly to India its concerns about India-Russia ties. Even while discussing cooperation under the game-changing initiative on critical and emerging technology, the US has made it clear to India there should not be any leakage of any sensitive and dual-use technology to Russia.",PM Narendra Modi rapped Putin publicly as he told him peace talks or conflict resolution under the shadow of guns can’t be successful.

He gave up his life to save others,” said an inconsolable Smriti Singh, the widow of Captain Anshuman Singh, while she stood before President Droupadi Murmu with folded hands to accept the Kirti Chakra , India’s second-highest gallantry honour, awarded posthumously to her husband on Friday for saving his fellow men's lives and trying to protect critical medical equipment during a fire incident at an Army dump on the world’s highest battlefield, the Siachen Glacier.Captain Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen. On July 19, 2023, an ammunition dump caught fire in the dead of night. The Captain saw a fibreglass hut engulfed in flames and quickly acted to save those trapped inside. He successfully rescued several individuals, but while trying to save critical medical equipment from a medical investigation centre that also caught fire, he laid down his life.The Rashtrapati Bhavan statement said: “Disregarding his own safety, Captain Anshuman Singh exhibited exceptional bravery and resolve to rescue many people during a major fire incident in Siachen. He was awarded the Kirti Chakra (posthumously) for his act of conspicuous gallantry and sacrifice.” Smriti Singh, along with the Captain’s mother Manju Singh, received the award from the President.After receiving the Kirti Chakra, Smriti Singh, in a video posted by a defense ministry spokesperson, recalled, “He once told me, ‘I would die with the brass on my chest. I would not die an ordinary death’.”Recalling her first meeting with Captain Singh, Smriti said, “We met on the first day of college. I don’t want to be dramatic, but it was love at first sight. After a month, he got selected into the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC). We met at an engineering college, but then he got selected for medical college. Super intelligent guy. From then on, after just one month of meeting, it was a long-distance relationship for eight long years.”“Then we decided to get married. Unfortunately, within two months of our marriage, he got posted to Siachen,” she said.“On July 18, we had a long conversation about how our life was going to be in the next 50 years. We would build a house, have kids... On the morning of July 19, I got a call that he was no more. For the next 7-8 hours, we were not ready to accept that anything of this sort had happened. Now that I have the Kirti Chakra in my hand, maybe it is true. It’s okay; he’s a hero. We can manage our lives. But he gave his life to save the other three families, his army family,” Smriti said, trying to hold back her tears.After the incident last year, Captain Singh was cremated with full state honours in Bhagalpur in UP’s Deoria district, on July 22, 2023.President Murmu also presented 26 Shaurya Chakras, including seven posthumously, to personnel of the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, and state/UT police during a defence investiture ceremony.","Captain Anshuman Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen.

House Democrats met Tuesday morning to discuss the way forward with a faltering Biden resolute to continue in the race and the outcome was unrevolutionary as the leaders started to accept that Biden will not opt out. Just before the House Democrats' meeting, a smaller group of swing-district Democrats held a meeting. Axios reported that some of the Democrats were actually in tears but not for Biden.The first meeting was pretty much unanimous that Biden has got to step downBut the Democrats' full caucus meeting was not unanimous with several lawmakers defending and opposing Biden's candidacy. While leaving the event, a somber Rep. Steve Cohen said Democrats were not only not on the same page, but they’re not even in the same book.This was the first full caucus since Biden's debate disaster. The lawmakers had no access to their phones during the meeting.Biden's schedule meanwhile for the second half of his week is jam-packed with Nato events. Biden is scheduled to deliver a speech marking the 75th anniversary of Nato later today and the events will start from tomorrow. The president will participate in all three work sessions for the summit over the course of Wednesday and Thursday. He and first lady Jill Biden will also host an arrival ceremony for the group Wednesday, and Biden will conduct a rare press conference on Thursday.Jill Biden said she is all in on Biden's bid to remain as the Democratic nominee for the presidential race.

However, he refrained from directly calling for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, suggesting instead that it is a matter for the president to contemplate.""Donald Trump is on track to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,"" Bennet said.The Democratic Party finds itself deeply divided on the issue of whether to rally behind Biden's reelection campaign, which has been marred by persistent concerns about his health and mental acuity, or to encourage him to step aside.Seven Democratic members of the House of Representatives have openly called for Biden to end his reelection bid, while no Democratic senators had before this made such a request. Biden, for his part, has consistently affirmed his intention to remain in the race.Biden's lackluster performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, coupled with his low public approval ratings, has intensified doubts among some Democrats about his prospects for winning the November 5 election and his ability to handle the demanding responsibilities of the presidency for another four and a half years. Many within the party are concerned that Biden has not adequately reassured voters that his debate performance was an anomaly rather than an accurate reflection of his capabilities.Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer dismissed questions about Biden's fitness, simply saying, ""I'm with Joe,"" during an exchange with reporters following a meeting of Senate Democrats to discuss the president's campaign.Some Democrats have expressed frustration that the party's focus has shifted to Biden's shortcomings rather than uniting against his Republican opponent.An increasing number of Democrats in Congress have voiced concerns about President Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump in the November 5 election, although closed-door meetings on Tuesday concluded without any plans for collective action. If Trump secures the White House and Republicans gain majorities in both chambers of Congress, he will encounter few obstacles in pursuing significant policy changes.Democrats already face a challenging battle to maintain their slim 51-49 Senate majority, as they must defend multiple seats in states that lean Republican. Republicans currently hold a 220-213 majority in the House.The Democratic Party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, provided little information about the hours-long closed-door discussions among Democratic lawmakers, who, in any case, lack the authority to force Biden to withdraw from the race even if they were to reach a consensus on a course of action.","Democratic Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado said that President Joe Biden may struggle to secure victory against former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November 2024 elections.

The infected individual, a resident of Deschutes County, is believed to have contracted the disease from their pet Cat.Health officials have ensured that all close contacts of the infected person and their pet have been contacted and given medication to prevent the illness.""All close contacts of the resident and their pet have been contacted and provided medication to prevent illness,"" said Dr. Richard Fawcett, the Deschutes County health officer.The bubonic plague, carried by rodents like squirrels and chipmunks and their fleas, has a notorious history. It is infamous for causing the Black Death , which devastated Europe in the 14th century. When an infected rodent dies, its fleas can spread the infection to other animals or humans through bites.While there is no vaccine for the plague, early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics can effectively cure the disease. However, if left untreated, the bubonic plague can be fatal.","A case of bubonic plague has been confirmed in Colorado.

There are theories

US President Joe Biden's doctor on Monday released a statement addressing concerns about the President's health following the June 27 presidential debate.In the statement, Dr O'Connor confirmed that Biden has not consulted a neurologist outside of his routine annual physical examination. He explained, ""I wanted to share with you background on why Dr Kevin Cannard visited the White House.To protect patient privacy for the thousands of patients of the White House Medical Unit and the physicians who treat them, normally we do not disclose the names of the specialists we work with. However, in the interests of accuracy, I have obtained permission from the President and Dr Cannard to confirm the details I am sharing.""Dr O'Connor also disclosed that as part of Biden's annual physical, the President sees a team of specialists covering various areas, including Optometry, Dentistry, Orthopedics (Foot and Ankle), Orthopedics (Spine), Physical Therapy, Neurology, Sleep Medicine, Cardiology, Radiology, and Dermatology.Connor also released the findings of Biden's health exam conducted in February.Furthermore, Dr O'Connor shared the findings of Biden's health exam conducted in February. The report stated, ""An extremely detailed neurologic exam was again reassuring in that there were no findings which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or ascending lateral sclerosis, nor are there any signs of cervical myelopathy. This exam did again support a finding of peripheral neuropathy in both feet. No motor weakness was detected.""The report also noted, ""He exhibits no tremor, either at rest or with activity. He demonstrates excellent fine motor dexterity. But a subtle difference in heat/cold sensation could be elicited as it was last year. This heat/cold sensation deficit was detected a couple of inches higher on his ankle/calf this year, which is not unexpected. There may, in fact, be day to day subjective variation of these findings, as during last year's exam, this area of sensation deficit was actually found to be smaller than the year before.""Administration officials have attributed his perplexed and sometimes incomprehensible responses during the debate with Republican Donald Trump to a head cold, jet lag, and inadequate preparation at Camp David. However, at 81 years old, Biden's health has emerged as a significant concern for many voters as the November election approaches.","US President Joe Biden's doctor released a statement addressing concerns about the President's health following the June 27 presidential debate.

Biden, alongside leaders from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Romania, announced the delivery of strategic airdefense systems to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities.Meanwhile, concerns over Biden's political durability lingered among NATO leaders, who face uncertainties over future U.S. leadership.

Officials described the operation as part of an ongoing effort to sow discord in the US through the creation of fictitious social media profiles that purported to belong to legitimate users but were actually designed to advance the aims of the Russian government, including by spreading disinformation about its war with Ukraine.US officials said the scheme was organized in 2022 by a senior editor at RT , a Russian-state funded media organization that has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent.It received the support and financial approval of the Kremlin, with an officer of Russia's Federal Security Service - or FSB - leading a private intelligence organization that promoted disinformation through social media.An email to RT was not immediately returned Tuesday.The disruption of the so-called social media bot farm comes as US officials have raised alarms about the potential for AI technology to impact American elections and amid ongoing concerns that foreign influence campaigns by adversaries could shape the opinions of unsuspecting voters, like an elaborate plot by Russians to disrupt the 2016 presidential election through a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed in part at helping Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.""Today's actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored Generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. ""Russia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government.""Among the fake posts, according to the Justice Department, was a video that was posted by a purported Minneapolis, Minnesota resident that showed Russian President Vladimir Putin saying that areas of Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania were ""gifts"" to those countries from liberating Russian forces during World War II.As part of the disruption, the Justice Department seized two domain names and 968 accounts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.The FBI and the Cyber National Mission Force also worked with with the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and law enforcement in the Netherlands on a joint cybersecurity advisory about the social media bot farm.","The Justice Department seized nearly 1,000 bogus social media accounts.

on Biden as Nato summit opens in Washington,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-eyes-and-few-ayes-on-biden-as-nato-summit-opens-in-washington/articleshow/111612893.cms,"WASHINGTON: The world's most formidable military alliance began a three-day meeting in Washington DC on Tuesday, ostensibly to strengthen partnership on its 75th anniversary and pledge greater support to Ukraine in its war with Russia . At the same time, all eyes are on the host, US President Joe Biden , whose re-election bid is in jeopardy on the growing perception that he is infirm and aging rapidly, and the looming shadow behind him of his Republican rival Donald Trump , who has often threatened to dismantle NATO and is seen in many quarters as unhinged.The global geo-strategic gathering against the backdrop of domestic US political drama came even as India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow attracted adverse notice. A state department spokesman said Washington has ""made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia.” But a sharper reaction came from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who posted photos of a children’s hospital in Kyiv that was struck by a Russian missile on Monday, while tweeting, “It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.""For the moment though, NATO leaders are more concerned with outcome of the struggle the US President is waging to salvage his re-election bid against critics in his own party and liberal elites beyond. That ongoing tussle witnessed further drama on Monday when it was disclosed that a neurologist specializing in Parkinson's disease had visited the White House eight times in the last eight months, a log-book disclosure that rattled the US political cage.The White House eventually explained that the neurological specialist, Dr Kevin Cannard, had indeed examined Biden during each of his annual physicals, but not beyond that. Many of his visits related to regular neurology clinics at the White House Medical Clinic in support of other White House personnel, the President's physician Dr Kevin O'Connor said in a statement.“Many military personnel experience neurological issues related to their service, and Dr Cannard regularly visits the WHMU as part of this General Neurology Practice,” he added.O’Connor stressed that Biden's last physical found no signs of Parkinson's, which he detailed in a February 28 letter, and that the President ""has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.""The clarification did little to assuage concerns of the growing band of Biden critics in the Democratic eco-system who are convinced that the 81-year President will cede White House, and possibly the Senate and House too, to a more physically vigorous Donald Trump. One critic noted that ""July is not February,"" suggesting that the President is slowing down rapidly and will not be able to lead the country effectively for four years even if he were to win the November 2024 election.TV networks on Tuesday wheeled out doctors specializing in Parkinson's, with one physician who said he was a Democrat telling NBC News that Biden is definitely showing symptoms indicating onset of Parkinson's, and that he should drop out of the race in the interest of the party and the country.The physician, Dr Tom Pitts, said Biden is showing ""classic features of neurological degeneration"" including word-finding difficulties; rigidity, including loss of arm swing; standing up robotically; shuffling gait; and low, hypotonic monotone voice, among others.There will be minute scrutiny for any manifestation of those symptoms over the next three days during which Biden -- older than the NATO alliance itself -- will appear in public several times, including at a concluding press conference on Thursday. Even Biden supporters are wishing for a more forceful and energetic leader to lead them, but it is not certain the 81-year old President can pull it off even if he wants to.Any verbal and physical misstep will be amplified and magnified by tv cameras and talking heads, potentially leading to the end of Biden's bid for a second term -- and possibly of NATO too if his rival wins in November.","US President Joe Biden's re-election bid is in jeopardy on the growing perception that he is infirm and aging rapidly.

Reports claimed Biden's personal physician met Parkinson's expert indicating that Biden is probably under Parkinson's treatment -- a claim that the White House vehemently opposed.Several narratives have been put forward in defense of the 81-year-old president's mental fragility that he is prone to gaffes during the night time and functions perfectly during the day etc. He reportedly told the Democrat governors that he needs more sleep.The WSJ report claims the German officials were aware of Biden's sleep schedule and intentionally kept the meeting early evening so that it could accommodate Biden. but Biden never showed up and Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended the meeting instead and announced that Biden had to go to bed.The report noted that this has been the situation in Biden's inner circle for around two years now with senior White House advisers ""aggressively"" stage-managing Biden's movement and personal interactions.""The White House has limited Biden’s daily itinerary and shielded him from impromptu exchanges.

The appeal was filed after the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected the SIC's plea for awarding its share in the 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly and another 156 in the four provincial assemblies.The SIC became prominent after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party-supported candidates joined the party after winning the elections as jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's PTI could not contest the polls and was not eligible to claim the seats reserved for women and minorities.The seats were awarded to the winning parties based on proportional representation .The ECP had rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats as it had not contested the elections and got strength when PTI-backed independently elected candidates joined after the elections.Its appeal against the ECP decision in the Peshawar High Court was also turned down. Subsequently, the party challenged it in the Supreme Court.A 13-member bench headed by Chief Justice Faez Isa and comprising justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Rizvi, Shahid Waheed, Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the case.Chief Justice Isa announced at the conclusion of the proceedings that the panel decided to reserve the verdict for mutual consultation.He did not give any date for the announcement of the judgment, which is expected this week.""We will see if a short judgment can be announced,"" the chief justice remarked while reserving the judgment.Earlier, the Supreme Court on May 6 in a major relief to the PTI, suspended the Peshawar High Court's decision about rejecting the SIC plea.Following the ruling, the ECP on May 14 suspended the victory notifications of 77 candidates who belonged to other parties and were declared successful on the reserved seats.The final ruling by the top court in the case would decide the fate of those 77 reserved seats. Though it may not change the current power structure, the changes in the overall number game in the assemblies may impact the law-making process in the country.The problem of the PTI began when just before the general election, it was deprived of its symbol of cricket bat by the ECP for failure to hold the intra-party election according to its Constitution. It forced PTI to field its candidates as independents.PTI candidates joined the SIC to secure a due share in the reserved seats, but the ECP rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats by saying that it had not contested elections and also did not provide a list of candidates for the reserved seats within the stipulated time, which was mandatory.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment in a key petition by the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party.

Pakistan has long hosted an estimated 1.7 million Afghans, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation. Since the crackdown started in November, an estimated 600,000 Afghans have returned home.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111603109,imgsize-46582,width-400,resizemode-4/111603109.jpg"
