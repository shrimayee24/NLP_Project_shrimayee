Why are they protesting?



NEW DELHI: Employees of Karnataka’s state-run transport corporations began an indefinite strike on Tuesday morning, disrupting public bus services across the state and causing difficulties for passengers.Buses stopped running from 6.00 am after workers of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation ( KSRTC ), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), and Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC) went on strike.The strike led to long queues and confusion at bus stations, as many people were left looking for other ways to travel.On Monday, the Karnataka high court had directed transport workers to hold off on their strike plan. But all four corporations decided to go ahead with the protest.The strike is being held over demands including the release of 38 months of unpaid salaries, implementation of wage revision from January 1, 2024, opposition to privatisation, end to worker harassment, and a demand that company drivers be assigned to electric buses as well.Talks between the government and transport unions had failed before the strike.The high court had issued an interim stay on the strike on Monday, saying that a complete halt of public transport would cause hardship to the public. However, the unions have decided to go ahead with their protest.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had urged the workers to cancel the strike. However, union leaders said the government’s offer to clear only two years of arrears was not acceptable and that there was no clear assurance on salary revision.KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation president H V Anantha Subbarao said, as quoted by PTI, ""We are not satisfied. We want full 38 months' arrears.""","Buses stopped running from 6.00 am after workers of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and three other corporations went on strike.

HC: Past overstays cannot be reason to deny furlough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-past-overstays-cannot-be-reason-to-deny-furlough/articleshow/123106118.cms,".

Nagpur: In a ruling underscoring the rehabilitative purpose of furlough, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court quashed prison department's refusal to grant leave to a life convict, stating that past overstays on furlough (leave of absence for a specified period to a convict from prison) cannot permanently disqualify a prisoner from exercising the right to temporary release.A division bench comprising Justices Anil Pansare and Mahendra Nerlikar was hearing a plea filed by Shankar Landge, a 38-year-old serving life imprisonment at Nagpur Central Jail, following his conviction by a Wardha court on murder charges in 2010.""The very object of the furlough is reformation and social integration and, therefore, if it is denied for years together, it would frustrate the purpose of incorporation of provisions in the rules,"" the bench stated in its order last week.The judges said the jail superintendent also lost sight of the fact that since 2014, the petitioner had not been granted furlough. ""Merely because he overstayed on earlier occasions, that by itself does not disqualify the petitioner from the grant of furlough leave,"" the HC ruled.The petitioner's furlough request was rejected on March 22 by DIG (Prisons), Nagpur, citing multiple instances of overstay between 2010 and 2014.Landge challenged the decision in high court. Opposing his plea, public prosecutor S Thakur informed the bench that the convict had overstayed his release by 18 days in 2010, 88 days in 2011, 265 days in 2013 and 56 days in 2014.The court, however, noted that Landge had not been granted furlough since Nov 18, 2014. His counsel argued that the past overstays - now over a decade old - should not weigh against him indefinitely. The petitioner also gave an undertaking that he would diligently perform his allotted prison duties, addressing another concern flagged by the prison authorities.Allowing the petition, the court directed Landge to be released on furlough for the period he had applied for, on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the prison authorities."," Bombay high court quashes prison department's refusal to grant leave to a life convict.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying ""Why is Modi afraid"" following US President Donald Trump’s remarks threatening increased tariffs on India over its continued oil trade with Russia.The party questioned PM Modi’s silence, alleging that foreign policy under the BJP government had become more about optics than national interest.Also read: 'They don't care': Trump says he will 'substantially' raise US tariff on India for buying Russian oil Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said, “So much for Howdy Modi. So much for Namaste Trump. So much for Ab ki Baar Trump Sarkar. So much for BJP MPs hailing Narendra Modi as India's trumpcard.”Jairam Ramesh added, “Despite all the hugs, all the handshakes, all the high-decibel bromance — ‘My friend Dolaand’ has delivered yet another jolt.” He questioned what came of the “much-vaunted” front-row seat at Trump’s inauguration or the prime minister being one of the first world leaders to visit the White House. “Tariffs are being slapped. Negotiations are going nowhere,” he said, also referring to Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir’s recent White House visit.“This is what happens when foreign policy becomes about image-building, not national interest,” Ramesh wrote.Also read: Trump tariff threat: No order for refiners from India to stop Russian oil imports despite US pressure, claims report Meanwhile, in a separate post on X, the Congress party directly questioned the Prime Minister, saying, “Now Narendra Modi's friend Trump has openly threatened India. Trump has said that he will impose even more tariffs on India.”“Trump claims India is buying large quantities of oil from Russia and making huge profits by selling it. India doesn’t care about those being killed in Ukraine. Trump is speaking out against India every day, and Narendra Modi is quietly listening to it all. Why is Modi so afraid of Trump?” the post read.The political row comes after Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, said India was profiting from the war in Ukraine and warned of a substantial tariff hike. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,” Trump wrote.The statement follows earlier warnings from Trump about a 25 per cent tariff on India for its energy and defence transactions with Russia.White House deputy chief of Staff Stephen Miller echoed the sentiment in a Fox News interview, accusing India of being “basically tied with China” in oil imports from Russia. “People would be shocked... This is astonishing,” Miller said, alleging India also imposed high tariffs on US goods and had violated immigration norms.Also read: 'Not acceptable': Trump's aide accuses India of financing Russia's war; claims New Delhi tied with China in purchasing crude oil Last week, Trump criticised India’s trade policies, calling its barriers “the most strenuous and obnoxious” globally. He also remarked that India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”While Trump later claimed India may have halted Russian oil imports, he added, “That’s what I heard... but I don’t know if that’s right or not.”India has not confirmed any change in its oil trade with Russia. On Friday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said energy decisions were based on market pricing and global conditions. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament that India will act to protect its national interest.","The party questioned PM Modi’s silence, alleging that foreign policy under the BJP government had become more about optics than national interest.

‘Op Akhal’ Enters Day 3; One Terrorist Killed in Joint Operation in Kulgam

NEW DELHI: Security forces have recovered a cache of arms and explosives including Chinese grenades and an IED manual from a stony cave in the Kalaroos area of Kupwara district following a joint three-day operation, officials said on Monday.The Border Security Force, Indian Army, and Jammu and Kashmir Police carried out the operation between August 2 and 4. According to a statement from BSF Kashmir, “In a 3-day joint search operation in Kalaroos, Kupwara (J&K), BSF, Army and police uncovered a stony cave on 04 Aug 2025. 12 Chinese grenades, Chinese pistol with ammunition, Kenwood radio set, Urdu IED manual and fire sticks recovered from the hideout and foiled the nefarious plan of the terrorist. ”The joint forces said the recovery points to cross-border terror support and efforts to revive militant activity in North Kashmir.In South Kashmir, operations are also underway in the Akhal Devsar area of Kulgam district for the fourth consecutive day.

Suleman was an A-category commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. ”The three were eliminated in the Harwan area near Dachigam National Park, and had been linked to the Pahalgam terror attack.

'Nazi' BJP Targeting 'Bengalis': TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Explosive Interview On Gurugram Crackdown

NEW DELHI: Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee has resigned from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha, news agency PTI reported on Monday, citing party sources. His resignation comes against the backdrop of an ongoing public feud with fellow party MP Mahua Moitra.Just minutes before the news of his resignation emerged, Banerjee, who represents Serampore in the Lok Sabha, took to social media platform X to criticise Moitra over her alleged remarks made during a recent public podcast. He accused her of using ""dehumanising language"" and compared her comments to “outright abuse.”“I have taken note of the recent personal remarks made by Ms Mahua Moitra in a public podcast... comparing a fellow MP to a 'pig' reflects a deep disregard for basic norms of civil discourse,” Banerjee posted.He defended his earlier statements, saying they focused on questions of public accountability and conduct, and were not misogynistic. He added, “Labeling a male colleague as ‘sexually frustrated’ isn’t boldness, it’s outright abuse.”Banerjee further claimed that Moitra was using personal attacks to deflect from questions regarding her performance as an MP. He said, “Those who rely on abuse instead of answers are not champions of democracy, they are its embarrassment.”The fallout between the two senior TMC leaders reportedly began in April, when Moitra confronted Banerjee inside the Parliament building after her name was left out from a party delegation memorandum. That incident reportedly led to a tense exchange in front of other MPs and party members.Following that, Banerjee accused Moitra of asking security personnel to arrest him and described her as ""rude"" and ""uncivilised."" He had earlier also raised personal questions about Moitra’s marital life while responding to her criticisms.TMC has not officially commented on Banerjee's resignation or the ongoing dispute.",Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee has resigned from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha.

SC pulls up Rahul for 'Chinese thrashing our soldiers' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-pulls-up-rahul-for-chinese-thrashing-our-soldiers-remark/articleshow/123104339.cms,".

Were you there on the border?

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, got a rap on his knuckles on Monday from the Supreme Court for his 2022 statement - Chinese are ""thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh"" - while criticising the government for its handling of the Galwan Valley clash at the LAC. ""If you were a true Indian, you would not say all this,"" the apex court told him.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih lambasted Rahul for making allegations that China captured 2,000 sq km of Indian territory and asked him whether he was present there. It made it clear to him that as leader of opposition he cannot go on saying whatever he wants.Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Gandhi, defended him saying, ""if he cannot say these things which are published in the Press, he cannot be a leader of opposition"". However, he agreed that the statement could have been worded better.SC's censure came during the hearing on Rahul's plea for staying a defamation case filed against him over his claim about Indian jawans having been walloped by the Chinese during the Galwan standoff. After the hearing, the court stayed the defamation proceedings against him but not before giving him an earful.""Tell, Dr Singhvi, how do you get to know that 2,000 sq km of Indian territory was occupied by the Chinese? Were you there? Do you have any credible material? Why do you make these statements without any...Ifyou were a true Indian, you would not say all this if there is a conflict at the border,"" the bench said.The senior advocate responded by saying that it was also possible that a true Indian would say that 20 Indian soldiers were beaten up and killed as it was a matter of concern for the country.Singhvi argued that while some people may not agree with the statement, it was not prohibited under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which pertains to the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. He underscored that public interest was involved in the issue and it would be unfortunate if a leader of opposition could not raise and highlight such an issue.“Whatever you have to say, why don’t you say it in Parliament? Why do you have to say this in social media posts?” the bench asked.Challenging the defamation case proceedings, Singhvi said it was done to harass Rahul, and he also pointed out that the trial court did not follow section 223 of BNSS which said prior hearing of the accused was mandatory before taking cognisance of a criminal complaint. The court, thereafter, issued notice on Rahul’s plea and stayed the proceeding in the case, despite senior advocate Gaurav Bhatia, appearing for the complainant, opposing the stay order. The bench asked him to file a response.Rahul moved SC after the Allahabad high court on May 29 rejected his plea for quashing of summoning order passed in Feb by a court in Lucknow. The HC observed that freedom of speech and expression did not include the freedom to make statements which defame the Indian Army. The complaint was filed by former Border Roads Organisation (BRO) director Uday Shankar Srivastava against Rahul for making the allegedly derogatory remarks in Dec 2022 during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.“People will ask about Bharat Jodo Yatra, here and there, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot and what-not. But they will not ask a single question about China capturing 2,000 sqkm of Indian territory, killing 20 Indian soldiers and thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh. But the Indian Press doesn’t ask a question to them about this. Isn’t it true? The nation is watching all this. Don’t pretend that people don’t know,” Rahul had said at a press conference during the yatra.","Supreme Court tells Rahul Gandhi that as leader of opposition he cannot go on saying whatever he wants.

Kerala police on Monday recovered more human remains from a 2.5-acre property in Pallippuram, Cherthala, as part of an ongoing investigation into the disappearance of several middle-aged women over the past two decades.Police sources told PTI that 20 charred bones were recovered from a new spot on the premises, separate from where body parts were first found last week.The discovery is part of an ongoing investigation led by the Kottayam unit of the State Crime Branch.Cadaver dogs and forensic experts were brought in as officers carried out a detailed search across the compound, including ponds and marshland. Some clothing items were also recovered from one of the ponds.The investigation centres around Sebastian, 68, a real estate broker, who was arrested last week in connection with the disappearance of Jainamma, a woman from Ettumanur who went missing in December 2024. He has since been remanded in judicial custody.The remains of a charred body were first recovered from Sebastian’s property as part of the probe into Jainamma’s case. Her siblings’ blood samples were collected for DNA testing, and the autopsy of the remains was conducted at Kottayam Medical College Hospital.Sebastian is also a suspect in the case of Bindu Padmanabhan, 47, a native of Cherthala, and is under investigation for possible involvement in at least three of the four missing women cases from the region between 2006 and 2025. One more person is currently in police custody in connection with the case.Among the women feared to have met with foul play are Ayesha, who went missing about a decade ago, and Jainamma, whose case reopened this chilling trail. Sebastian was brought to the site for evidence collection, but investigators say he has given contradictory statements so far.Police are now considering breaking open the floor of a recently tiled granite room inside the house as the search deepens. DNA testing will be crucial to establishing the identity of the victims.","20 charred bones were recovered from a new spot on the premises, separate from where body parts were first found last week.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Sunday issued a letter threatening that he would remove any Democrats from the House if they do not return to Austin to pass the GOP’s proposed new congressional maps.The Republican governor’s late-night missive came after more than 50 Democrats left the state Sunday afternoon to prevent a vote on a new congressional map favouring Republicans.In a letter, Governor said, ""These absences are not merely unintended and unavoidable interruptions in public service, like a sudden illness or a family emergency. Instead, these absences were premeditated for an illegitimate purpose— what one representative called “breaking quorum.” Another previously signaled that Democrats “would have to go by an extreme measure” of a quorum break “to stop these bills from happening. ” In other words, Democrats hatched a deliberate plan not to show up for work, for the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber’s business.""""That amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office. When the Governor calls a Special Session, our Constitution provides that the “Legislature shall meet.”TEX. CONST. art. III, § 5 (emphasis added). It’s not optional. It’s a duty... This truancy ends now. The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025. For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,"" he added.Texas' Republican majority recently introduced redistricting plans, supported by President Donald Trump, which would establish five additional Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives.A vote requires two-thirds attendance of the 150-member Texas legislature. Fifty-one Democratic legislators have left, primarily to Illinois, preventing the required quorum, BBC reported.They intend to remain absent for two weeks until the special legislative session, called by Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott, concludes.The session aims to approve redistricting, provide disaster relief for recent Texas floods, and prohibit THC, marijuana's primary active component.Each absent lawmaker faces potential daily fines of £380, whilst Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, has issued arrest threats.On X, he advocated using ""every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law"".""Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,"" he wrote.Texas Democrats issue statement, defending their actions""We're not walking out on our responsibilities,"" stated Gene Wu, state legislator and Democratic caucus chairman.""We're walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent.""Whilst Democrats nationwide have suggested reciprocal actions, their options appear limited.In Democrat-controlled redistricting states like Illinois, New Mexico and Nevada, they have engaged in similar gerrymandering practices.Illinois' latest map received an F grade from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project for political unfairness.However, some Democrat-led states, including New York, California, Colorado and Washington, utilise non-partisan, independent commissions for redistricting rather than state legislatures.Texas Republicans currently control 25 of 38 congressional seats. The new maps could increase their representation to 30 seats - all in districts Trump won by over 10 points last November.Before next year's midterms, Texas' redistricting could strengthen the Republican majority in the US House, where they hold 219 seats to Democrats' 212.",Texas Governor Greg Abbott threatens to remove any Democrats from the House if they do not return to Austin.

US envoy's visit fails to halt escalation





In a major development, Israel may come up with a new plan for Gaza Strip that may include the possibility of taking full control of the Palestinian enclave and escalating military action in areas they have refrained from entering, according to local media reports.This signals a dramatic escalation in its nearly two-year-long war against Hamas. Quoting a senior source in Netanyahu's office, prominent Israeli journalist Amit Segal of Channel 12 reported, 'The decision has been made… we are going to occupy the Gaza Strip.""The move comes amid a total breakdown in ceasefire negotiations and growing frustration within the Israeli leadership over the lack of progress on freeing hostages held by Hamas since the conflict's early days.""Hamas will not release hostages without total surrender. If we do not operate now, the hostages will die of starvation, and Gaza will remain under Hamas’ control,"" Segal quoted the official as saying, according to a report from Fox News.The Israeli Security Cabinet is set to convene on Tuesday to finalise the next steps in Gaza. According to The Times of Israel, several ministers confirmed that Netanyahu has privately used the term ""occupation of the Strip"" to describe his intentions, a sharp pivot from the government's previous reluctance to re-enter densely populated zones.A senior official quoted by the Ynet news site said bluntly, ""The die is cast — we are going for a full occupation of the Gaza Strip.""Currently, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) control around 75% of Gaza's territory. The new plan would see Israeli forces enter all remaining areas, including zones where hostages are reportedly being held, a controversial move that could risk the lives of captives and escalate civilian casualties.According to The Times of Israel, the reported shift has exposed internal cracks within Israel's military and political establishment. According to Hebrew media, IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir opposes the occupation strategy. In response, a senior source close to Netanyahu allegedly said, ""If the chief of staff doesn't agree, he should resign.""The rift underscores the deep unease surrounding the operational and humanitarian implications of such a full-scale takeover, especially at a time when Gaza's infrastructure is in ruins, and humanitarian aid remains insufficient.The decision to escalate comes just days after US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff visited Israel to promote a new peace framework. Despite assurances that negotiations were ongoing, both sides now appear to have abandoned diplomatic channels.Netanyahu's reported plan, if approved, could have sweeping consequences for Gaza's over two million residents, as well as for regional stability. Aid agencies have warned that continued fighting, especially in densely populated urban pockets, could trigger a humanitarian catastrophe.","Israeli Security Cabinet set to convene on Tuesday to finalise next steps in Gaza.

‘Direct threat’: Russia walks out of nuclear treaty with US; cites ‘actions of Western countries’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/direct-threat-russia-walks-out-of-nuclear-treaty-with-us-cites-actions-of-western-countries/articleshow/123100966.cms,"



Russia on Monday announced it no longer considers itself bound by the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, blaming “the actions of Western countries” for creating a “direct threat” to its security. In a statement reported by RT, the Russian Foreign ministry said the conditions for maintaining the treaty had “disappeared,” and that the country is no longer observing its previous self-imposed restrictions.“The Russian foreign ministry notes the disappearance of conditions for maintaining the unilateral moratorium on the deployment of similar weapons and is authorized to state that Russia no longer considers itself bound by the corresponding self-imposed restrictions previously adopted,” the statement read. The ministry added that US activity, including the deployment of a Typhon missile launcher in the Philippines and missile firings during the Talisman Sabre exercise in Australia, was a key factor behind the decision.The INF Treaty, signed in 1987, banned ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. It collapsed in 2019 when the United States withdrew from it, citing Russian violations.Moscow has rejected those allegations and in turn accused the US of developing missiles prohibited under the pact. President Vladimir Putin warned the collapse of the treaty would “significantly erode the global security framework. ”The announcement comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said he had ordered the deployment of two nuclear submarines “in appropriate regions” following what he described as “highly provocative comments” by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Trump did not clarify whether the submarines were nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed, nor did he disclose their location.“Russia is very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation. And we believe that everyone should be very, very cautious with nuclear rhetoric,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, as quoted by AFP.The dispute followed Trump’s ultimatum for Russia to end its military offensive in Ukraine or face sweeping new sanctions. Medvedev responded sharply, saying: “Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country.” Trump later told Newsmax: “When you talk about nuclear, we have to be prepared… and we’re totally prepared.”With Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff expected in Moscow this week ahead of the president’s August 9 deadline, the fallout from Russia’s treaty withdrawal may further strain already fragile diplomatic efforts.",Russia says it no longer considers itself bound by the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.

As Kyiv burns, Zelensky demands action





A wounded Ukrainian soldier cycled to safety, who was stuck in the enemy's zone for days. The incident took place after Russia launched an assault that left his fellow soldiers dead. Andriy, stationed near Ukraine's Siversk, was surrounded by enemy, but his team members at the command bunker hatched a plan to save him by delivering a 40 kg e-bike by a drone.A video is doing rounds on social media, where the injured Ukrainian soldier, can be seen identifying himself by his call sign ""Tanker."" He was the sole survivor of a three-man unit ambushed by Russian forces during a skirmish in Siversk, northern Ukraine. Isolated and injured, he held out as Russian troops surrounded him on all sides, according to a report from The Independent.""Every day, I was surrounded, from all sides. I fought back as best I could,"" Tanker said in a video released by Ukraine's Rubizh brigade, according to The Independent. ""They threw two gas cylinders and a lighter into our trench. We caught fire.""Brigade commander Mykola Hrytsenko said driving a rescue team in was impossible, with Russian forces occupying every flank.The tanker couldn't walk the 1.5 km to safety in his condition.So, the brigade turned to a bold, video game-style plan: deliver an electric bike by drone.The first two drone missions failed. Russian forces shot down the first delivery; the second crashed. But on the third attempt, a drone successfully dropped the 40kg e-bike into enemy-held territory, just within reach of Tanker.But even then, the mission was far from over.After pedalling 400 metres, the soldier hit a remote mine. Injured again, he limped 200 metres further before his unit managed to reach him. A second e-bike was then sent, allowing him to ride 15 minutes to an evacuation point under the cover of darkness and precision-planned weather conditions.""To carry out this operation, they had to calculate the right time of day, the right weather conditions that would allow him to do it,"" said Cdr Hrytsenko.News of the rescue comes as Russian forces launched a fresh wave of missile strikes on Kyiv early Thursday, killing at least 16 people, including a six-year-old boy and his mother.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, condemning the brutality, called on allies to pursue ""regime change"" in Russia, escalating diplomatic pressure on Moscow.","A wounded Ukrainian soldier cycled to safety, who was stuck in the enemy's zone for days.

Poll Should airlines implement stricter checks on children's travel documents? Yes, definitely No, it's not necessary





A couple allegedly abandoned their 10-year-old son at the Barcelona Airport after discovering his passport had expired, choosing to board their flight home without him to avoid missing it, reported The Sun.A terminal worker who goes by the name of Lilian has posted a video on social media, criticizing the actions of the parents, garnering over 300,000 views. In her video, she claims that the parents reportedly arranged for a relative to pick their son up so that they could continue their journey.However, their unusual plan unraveled when airport staff discovered the boy alone and alerted the police, according to the air traffic coordinator.""He told them that his parents were on the plane on their way to their home country, going on vacation,"" Lilian said in her video, reported The Sun.""His passport in the country was expired, so the child was travelling with a Spanish passport but the Spanish passport needed a visa. As they did not have a visa, they left the child at the terminal and called a relative to come and pick him up,"" she added.Urgent contact was then made with the plane’s pilot, who then confirmed that the police had informed him about a minor in the car park.Eventually, the parents were located who were accompanied by another, younger child.“I’m an air traffic controller, and as a controller, I’ve seen a lot of things, but this has been completely surreal,” Lilian added, reported the New York Post.""How is it possible for parents to leave their ten-year-old son at the terminal because he cannot travel due to documentation issues? They call a relative but the relative may take half an hour, about an hour, about three hours and they take the flight so calmly and leave the child behind!"" Lililian said.""They saw it as very normal. Obviously I didn't see it as normal and the police didn't see it as normal either,"" she said.Lilian reported that airport police eventually removed the parents’ luggage from the flight and escorted them to the on-site police station for questioning. It remains unclear whether the parents were formally arrested.","A couple allegedly abandoned their 10-year-old son at the Barcelona Airport after discovering his passport had expired.

SRINAGAR: Amid rumours of further bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir a day before the sixth anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370, chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday said “nothing will happen tomorrow”.“I’ve heard every possible permutation & combination about what to expect in J&K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow - fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either (sic.),” Omar wrote on X, as the state remained abuzz that Jammu may become a separate state.“I’m still optimistic about something positive for J&K in this monsoon session of Parliament but not tomorrow (sic.),” Omar said in a veiled reference to restoration of statehood, adding: “And no, I haven’t had any meetings or conversations with people in Delhi. This is just a gut feeling. Let’s see this time tomorrow.”While Omar appeared to dismiss the rumours, PDP’s Iltija Mufti said, “Since a week now, hushed whispers suggest something drastic yet again is in the offing. Insinuations dressed in metaphors & dark humour.”Her mother and former CM Mehbooba Mufti, in a post on X, criticised the abrogation of Article 370, but did not make any reference to the latest speculations.“Aug 4, 2019, we were silenced. Aug 5 our voice, our rights, our Constitution taken without our consent. What was ours by birth and by belonging was stripped away overnight. Not a whisper of warning. Not a shred of justice. Today, we remember. We resist,” she said.Earlier in the day, J&K Police held a high-level security review meeting, chaired by DGP Nalin Prabhat, amid the speculations. A police spokesperson said the DGP was apprised of the prevailing security situation in the UT by the IGs and heads of various wings, including intelligence. Prabhat emphasized the need to enhance the security measures and design effective counterinsurgency strategies for smooth and peaceful conduct of coming events in J&K, including Independence Day. He also directed the officers to increase surveillance on anti-national elements, intensify area domination exercises, and enhance the security of vulnerable targets.The DGP directed the district police chiefs to closely monitor social media platforms to prevent any attempt to spread misinformation impacting public safety and order, the spokesperson said.In the context of the rumours about another big announcement, Lt-General (retired) Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon, who was serving as the 48th commander of 15 Corps in Kashmir when Article 370 was abrogated, said on X: “The peace in Kashmir has come about at a great cost of human lives --- of security forces personnel and innocent civilians. It’s still fragile, as was evident from the Pahalgam terror attack. For the sake of those who laid down their lives in this journey of peace, as also those whose lives are going to be impacted by any decision on it, we should not rush into any hasty decision as consolidation phase for restoration of peace is going on. ”","Rumours of further bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir continue.

MOHALI: A special CBI court on Monday sentenced five former Punjab Police officials — including an SSP and DSP —to be jailed till death for the abduction, torture, and staged killing of seven innocent persons in 1993, three of whom were Special Police Officers (SPOs).The court said only their age had stopped them from going to the gallows but they deserved no leniency as their conduct was ""morally bankrupt and profoundly inhumane"". All the convicts are between 66 and 80 years of age, and one is wheelchair-bound.The verdict was pronounced by special CBI judge Baljinder Singh Sra, who also imposed a fine of Rs 3.5 lakh on each convict, amounting to a total of Rs 17.5 lakh, which will be distributed equally among the kin of the seven victims, said CBI public prosecutor Anmol Narang.Those convicted include former SSP Bhupinderjit Singh, former DSP Davinder Singh, ex-inspector Suba Singh, and ASIs Gulbarg Singh and Raghbir Singh. They were sentenced under various sections of IPC, including murder, criminal conspiracy, causing disappearance of evidence, and fabricating records.The convicts had filed mercy pleas, citing old age and health issues, but the court rejected any leniency on those grounds.In its scathing observations, the court remarked, ""There is no doubt regarding the sheer venality and callousness with which the convicts acted, reflecting an utter disregard for human dignity and life. Their conduct was not only unlawful — it was morally bankrupt and profoundly inhumane. However, in view of their advanced age and the prolonged agony endured during the course of the trial, this court refrains from awarding capital punishment. ""Victims' counsel, advocate Sarabjeet Singh Verka, said the judgment comes after a protracted legal battle that spanned over three decades. ""Justice has been delayed, but not denied. The families waited 32 years for this day,"" Verka said, adding that five other co-accused in the case died during the trial.The case pertains to the killing of seven young men from Rani Willa village in Tarn Taran — SPOs Shinder Singh, Sukhdev Singh and Desa Singh, Balkar Singh alias Kala, Sarabjit Singh alias Saba, Harwinder Singh, and Mangal Singh According to the CBI investigation, the victims were abducted by police teams in June-July 1993 and killed in two fake encounters on July 12 and July 28, 1993.The court accepted CBI's findings that the killings were not genuine encounters, but planned executions involving abduction, illegal detention, torture, and the eventual staging of deaths to pass them off as militant killings. The investigation revealed that inspector Gurdev Singh, then SHO of Sirhali, led the abduction of four victims on June 27, 1993. The other three were abducted by SHO of Verowal, Suba Singh, in July.CBI prosecutor Anmol Narang said the prosecution cited 67 witnesses, but 36 died during the trial. Only 28 witnesses could ultimately testify.Family members of the fake-encounter victims wept upon hearing the verdict. ""It's a moment of justice we thought would never come,"" said one of the relatives outside the courtroom. They expected the death sentence but are satisfied with the verdict.The widows demanded salary arrears and pension according to their husbands' remuneration and demanded govt jobs on compassionate grounds for their sons. The kin of the victims said that they have not conducted last rites or ‘Bhog' of their men killed by Punjab police as their bodies were never found.Most of the women became widows within two to three years of their marriages.","The court said only their age had stopped them from going to the gallows.

Fresh tremor of magnitude 5.1 struck far-east in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia today, reported the US Geological Survey (USGS).The tremor was recorded at 07:17:36 (UTC+05:30), with its epicentre located 144 km southeast of the Kamchatsky region at a depth of 25 km.Tremor follows a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula earlier in the week. According to experts, the quake was caused by intense tectonic activity along a major subduction zone where the Pacific Plate slides beneath the Okhotsk Plate. This zone lies within the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a seismically active belt notorious for frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The vertical displacement of the seafloor during the 8.7-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami, leading to wave alerts in multiple Pacific nations, including Russia, Japan, and the United States.Adding to the region’s turmoil, the Krasheninnikov volcano in Kamchatka erupted overnight for the first time in over 600 years on August 3, 2025. The rare volcanic activity closely followed the July 29 magnitude 8.8 earthquake off the coast of Petropavlovsk, intensifying concerns over tectonic instability in the area.","Tremor follows a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula earlier in the week.

Neither Russian officials nor media have addressed the damage, whilst international nuclear monitoring organisations report normal radiation levels in the vicinity.The base has undergone recent upgrades, with two new floating piers installed since Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion, according to military sources.Constructed during the Soviet era, the base's location in a sheltered cove provides natural protection from severe maritime conditions.Whilst most piers remain functional, tsunami waves from the earthquake affected one structure.The Conflict Intelligence Team told ""The New York Times"" that ""This is unlikely to affect the battle readiness of the base -- and repairs for the pier are probably not going to be costly.""On July 30, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region, generating substantial tsunami waves along the Pacific Coast and triggering worldwide alerts. The epicentre was approximately 80 miles from Rybachiy.The base shares its bay with Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, which sustained minimal damage.Whilst tsunami waves were observed offshore, they did not reach the city centre.Both the submarine base and Rybachiy town maintain strict security protocols limiting public access.Following Ukrainian drone strikes on distant targets including an eastern Siberian airfield, Russia relocated certain military assets eastward this summer.The Kamchatka region experienced multiple seismic events last week, including a significant earthquake, subsequent aftershocks and volcanic activity.","Satellite imagery shows damage to a floating pier at the Rybachiy submarine base, a crucial Pacific Fleet installation on the Kamchatka peninsula.

'Totally unconscionable': Vivek Ramaswamy condemns Downtown Cincinnati attack; slams ‘anti-law enforcement culture’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/totally-unconscionable-vivek-ramaswamy-condemns-downtown-cincinnati-attack-slams-anti-law-enforcement-culture/articleshow/123106189.cms,"



Recently, a video going viral, showing multiple individuals being violently assaulted in downtown Cincinnati, has prompted Vivek Ramaswamy to criticise the prevalent ""anti-law enforcement culture"" in American society.The former 2024 presidential candidate and Ohio Republican gubernatorial hopeful discussed with Fox News Digital exclusively on Monday evening before a Cincinnati town hall focused on violence prevention. He stated that the Cincinnati incident has ""catalyzed a conversation in our state and frankly across the country about this issue of violent crime in the cities of the United States of America.""He described the assault on Holly, a woman in the video who apparently tried to help another victim, as ""totally unconscionable.""The footage shows a group attacking two victims, including Holly, who suffered severe brain trauma. The incident occurred early July 26 at Fourth and Elm Streets, outside a popular nightclub.Ramaswamy mentioned his communication with Holly after initially contacting her about her condition following the assault. He noted that Holly informed him no local elected officials had reached out to her after the incident.The police have identified six victims in total. Six individuals face charges, with four already arrested. The authorities continue searching for two suspects. Police Chief Teresa Theetge reported that among approximately 100 witnesses or participants, only one person contacted law enforcement.The arrested suspects include Jermaine Matthews, 39, Dominique Kittle, 37, Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24.Ramaswamy advocates for Americans to feel secure in their cities without fear of assault. He expressed concern about people becoming indifferent to violence and emphasised the importance of addressing these issues through open dialogue rather than avoiding them.He acknowledged criticism for highlighting the incident but maintained that open discussion is crucial for bringing people together and addressing such problems effectively.Sharing the video from the Town hall, Ramaswamy said, ""We heard from a mother at tonight’s town hall who lost two teenage sons who were shot & killed in Cincinnati. It’s unconscionable & it’s time to actually do something instead of talking about it.""","Vivek Ramaswamy criticises the prevalent ""anti-law enforcement culture"" in American society.

Russiagate 'hoax': Attorney General Pam Bondi orders grand jury probe of Obama officials- Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-hoax-attorney-general-pam-bondi-orders-grand-jury-probe-of-obama-officials-report/articleshow/123105933.cms,"



United States attorney general Pam Bondi directed her staff on Monday to proceed with the criminal referral from director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard concerning the alleged Russia-Trump conspiracy, Fox News Digital reported adding that the department of Justice is initiating a grand jury investigation into this matter.According to a letter reviewed by Fox News Digital and information from a source close to the investigation, Bondi has authorised an unnamed federal prosecutor to begin legal proceedings. The prosecutor will present evidence to a grand jury, potentially leading to an indictment.while declining to comment specifically on the investigation, a DOJ spokesperson confirmed that Bondi is treating Gabbard's referral with utmost importance. The spokesperson indicated that Bondi identified significant reasons for concern and the necessity for further action.The DOJ acknowledged receiving Gabbard's criminal referral two weeks prior. The referral included documentation regarding the Intelligence Community's alleged suppression of evidence showing that Russian and criminal activities did not affect the 2016 presidential election through cyber-attacks.No charges have been filed at this point against any potential defendants.This development follows Gabbard's July declassification of intelligence, which provided fresh perspectives on the Obama administration's alleged assessment that Russia aimed to assist Trump in the 2016 election.According to Gabbard's press briefing, the Obama administration allegedly promoted an artificial narrative about Russian interference favouring Trump's victory. The declassified materials included records of Obama requesting his deputies to prepare a December 2016 intelligence assessment regarding Moscow's electoral influence methods.The assessment concluded that whilst Russian actions aimed to create distrust in democratic processes, they did not affect the election outcome. Gabbard has suggested that Obama and his national security officials established the foundation for allegations of Trump-Russia collusion.The scope and potential charges of the grand jury investigation remain uncertain, particularly given that statutes of limitations have expired for many activities from nearly ten years ago. Former Obama intelligence officials, including John Brennan, James Clapper and James Comey, have faced scrutiny regarding their alleged roles in developing intelligence that challenged Trump's 2016 victory.","US attorney general Pam Bondi directed her staff on Monday to proceed with the criminal referral from director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

Watch: 20-foot-long whale killed after boat collision in New Jersey; passenger thrown overboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-20-foot-long-whale-killed-after-boat-collision-in-new-jersey-passenger-thrown-overboard/articleshow/123087040.cms,"Image: X/@wakeupnj





A boat collided with a minke whale along the Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey, on Saturday, fatally injuring the animal and throwing one passenger overboard.Video circulating on social media shows the vessel rocking sharply after the impact, moments before a passenger is thrown overboard. The 20-foot whale appeared to swim away briefly before succumbing to its injuries.Officials from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center (MMSC) said they were alerted by the New Jersey state police Marine Unit around 2.45 pm (local time) on Saturday after a whale was spotted in Barnegat Bay near the inlet.MMSC staff coordinated with the US Coast Guard, the NJSP Marine Unit, and Sea Tow, while a stranding coordinator was dispatched to the scene, reports CBS News.Authorities received a report from a boater less than an hour later that a vessel struck the whale, nearly causing it to capsize, and threw a passenger into the water. The individual who went overboard was believed to be unharmed, as per officials, reports CBS News.Sea Tow, which remained at the scene to monitor the whale, later confirmed that the animal had died.The whale was located resting at a “very shallow” sandbar just outside the channel by the MMSC stranding coordinator and New Jersey Fish and Wildlife Conservation officers.Officials said plans are in place to tow the whale to a nearby New Jersey state park for a necropsy. However, due to limited access to heavy equipment and tidal timing, the whale will remain in place until Monday morning, when conditions are expected to allow for removal with assistance from Sea Tow.The video of the incident, which is now gaining significant traction on social media, has garnered sympathy for the deceased whale.“Oh, that poor whale. I hate that this happened,” commented a user.“Oh my gosh, this is just heartbreaking! Poor whale, and that passenger must have been terrified. It's such a tragedy that these kinds of accidents keep happening. We really need to do more to protect our marine life and ensure everyone's safety out there. Maybe stricter regulations on boat speeds in whale areas would help? It's just so sad to see nature suffer like this,” said another user.“So sad for the whale. I wonder what distresssed it?” commented another.The MMSC has advised boaters to exercise caution in the area north of Double Creek Channel in Barnegat Bay and to maintain a minimum distance of 150 feet from the whale carcass for safety reasons.","A boat collided with a minke whale along the Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey, on Saturday, fatally injuring the animal and throwing one passenger overboard.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"

Facing limited diplomatic options to resolve the hostage crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a “military solution” to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, an Israeli official was quoted as saying by ABC News on Sunday.Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.The official said that there is an increasing understanding within the Israeli leadership that Hamas is not interested in making a deal for the officials, reports ABC News.""Therefore, prime minister Netanyahu is pushing to expand military operations to release the hostages through a military solution,"" said the official.Tens of thousands gathered in the coastal city of Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand that Netanyahu’s government secure the release of the remaining hostages.""They are on the absolute brink of death,"" said Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, whose video was released by Hamas showing him in what he described as digging his own grave. ""In the current unimaginable condition, they may have only days left to live.""""The prime minister expressed profound shock over the materials distributed by the terror organisations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and told the families that the efforts to return all our hostages are ongoing, and will continue constantly and relentlessly,"" Netanyahu’s office stated late Saturday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist with the hostages held in Gaza, reports AFP.Hamas’s armed wing responded by agreeing to grant the agency access to the hostages, but only on the condition that ""humanitarian corridors"" for food and aid are opened “across all areas of the Gaza Strip.""For months, humanitarian groups and international agencies have warned that Gaza is experiencing ""critical"" hunger levels, with famine ""imminent"" in some areas of the Gaza Strip.Gaza’s health ministry has also reported an increasing number of deaths linked to malnutrition. Around 175 people, including 93 children, have died due to malnutrition, as per the ministry, reports ABC News.Israel has imposed strict limits on the flow of aid into the besieged Gaza Strip, while UN agencies, humanitarian organizations, and analysts report that much of the aid permitted is either looted or diverted amid chaotic conditions.Many Palestinians are forced to risk their lives to access whatever limited aid is distributed through controlled channels.","Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.

Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott on Monday ordered state authorities to arrest dozens of Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois in an effort to block a Republican-led congressional redistricting vote, intensifying a political standoff that has brought the legislative session to a halt.“To ensure compliance, I ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans,” Abbott said.“This order will remain in effect until all missing Democrat House members are accounted for and brought to the Texas Capitol,” he added as quoted by The New York Post.The walkout by 51 House Democrats prevented the Texas legislature from reaching the two-thirds quorum required for a vote, stalling a special legislative session called by Abbott. The session was aimed at advancing redistricting plans, providing disaster relief for recent Texas floods, and banning THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.“Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans,” Abbott said in a statement.“By fleeing the state, Texas House Democrats are holding hostage critical legislation to aid flood victims and advance property tax relief. There are consequences for dereliction of duty.”The Texas house ofrepresentatives voted 85-6 on Monday to approve a motion calling for the Democrats to return. House Speaker Dustin Burrows then directed the chamber’s sergeant at arms “to send for all absentees … under warrant of arrest, if necessary.”Most of the absent lawmakers traveled to Illinois, where dozens joined Democratic Governor JB Pritzker on Sunday night at the DuPage County Democratic Party headquarters.Roughly half a dozen other Democrats joined New York Governor Kathy Hochul in Albany on Monday.“If that’s what’s called for, that’s what’s called for,” Hochul said of the decision to leave Austin. She went on to call Abbott “un-American” and accused him of “rigging” the next congressional election for the GOP, reported The New York Post.“To subvert the will of the people, they’re hellbent on rigging the system. Rigging the system is un-American. Congressional districts are never drawn mid-decade,” she argued.The redistricting proposal, supported by President Trump, could net Republicans up to five additional seats in the US house of representatives—potentially expanding the GOP’s narrow majority in the 2026 midterm elections.","Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott ordered state authorities to arrest dozens of Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois.

The justice department has convened a federal grand jury to investigate officials from former US President Barack Obama’s administration, who are accused of pushing a false scandal about President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia during the 2016 election.The investigation could lead to criminal charges against several prominent figures from the Obama era, including former director of national intelligence James Clapper, former CIA director John Brennan, and former FBI director James Comey, according to The New York Post.The inquiry focuses on claims that these officials conspired to create and promote the Trump-Russia narrative in the early days of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation.The Crossfire Hurricane probe began in July 2016, when the FBI launched an investigation into alleged connections between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. That inquiry later led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose 2019 report acknowledged “links” between Trump associates and Russian individuals but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy.However, subsequent scrutiny raised concerns about the FBI’s conduct, particularly the improper use of FISA warrants against Trump adviser Carter Page.In October 2020, then-attorney general Bill Barr appointed John Durham as special counsel to examine the origins of the probe.Recent reports have highlighted a newly uncovered annex containing intelligence that “predicted the FBI’s actions with alarming specificity,” adding weight to Republican claims that the bureau may have sought to influence the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton.Trump and current director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard have both called for a federal investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Trump has accused the former officials of carrying out a “treasonous and seditious conspiracy” aimed at undermining his first-term agenda.He also acknowledged that Obama is likely immune from prosecution following a 2024 Supreme Court ruling that shields presidents from criminal charges related to official acts.",The investigation could lead to criminal charges against several prominent figures from the Obama era.

Nearly 10 years after her two toddlers disappeared in 2014 and have since not been found, a Maryland mother with a history of severe mental illness has been charged with their murders and rearrested.Catherine Hoggle, 38, was indicted last month by a Montgomery County grand jury on two counts of first-degree murder. She was taken into custody on Friday, according to the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office, reported AP.Hoggle is scheduled to appear in court Monday afternoon for a bail review hearing.Her children, Sarah and Jacob Hoggle, were 3 and 2 years old when they vanished in September 2014. Around the same time, Hoggle also went missing. The children's father, Troy Turner, reported all three missing. Days later, Hoggle was found walking in a nearby town but refused to tell police where the children were.She was initially arrested on misdemeanor charges of child neglect and abduction and sent to a state-run psychiatric facility for treatment. In 2017, she was indicted on murder charges. However, a judge later found her incompetent to stand trial and ordered her to continue court-mandated treatment.Under Maryland law, the state had five years to restore a defendant’s competency before charges must be dismissed. In 2022, a Montgomery County judge dropped the murder charges due to that legal deadline. Despite the dismissal, Hoggle remained involuntarily committed because she was considered a danger to herself or others.Montgomery county state’s attorney John McCarthy said at the time that if Hoggle was ever deemed no longer a threat and released, he was prepared to refile the murder charges.Her recent release from the psychiatric facility raised new questions about her mental health status. It remains unclear why she was released and whether she has been receiving treatment elsewhere, reported AP.Hoggle has a long-documented history of mental illness. Her attorney, David Felsen, has said she suffers from severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, and was treated with antipsychotic medications after her initial arrest.Turner, the children’s father, has acknowledged Hoggle’s condition, telling the Associated Press in 2014 that she had begun showing signs of psychosis and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. However, he later claimed she was feigning incompetency.","Catherine Hoggle, 38, was indicted last month by a Montgomery County grand jury on two counts of first-degree murder.

Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina officially launched her campaign for governor on Monday, entering a crowded GOP primary where candidates are vying for the coveted endorsement of US President Donald Trump.While her opponents tout their connections to Trump, Mace- who describes herself as “Trump in high heels”- says she’s the one best equipped to carry out his agenda in South Carolina, where he continues to hold strong support among Republican voters.Mace made her run official during a campaign event at The Citadel military college in Charleston, the same institution where she made history as the first woman to graduate. She plans to begin a statewide town hall tour this week, starting in Myrtle Beach.“I’m running for governor because South Carolina doesn’t need another empty suit and needs a governor who will fight for you and your values,” Mace said as quoted by Wate News.“South Carolina needs a governor who will drag the truth into sunlight and flip the tables if that’s what it takes.”In an interview with The Associated Press, Mace outlined her campaign priorities.She said her platform will focus on criminal justice reform, ending the state’s income tax, protecting women and children, expanding school choice and vocational education, and improving energy options.Official filing for South Carolina’s 2026 election doesn’t open until March, but the governor’s race is already drawing multiple Republican contenders.Attorney general Alan Wilson, Lt Gov Pamela Evette, and Rep Ralph Norman have all entered what will be the state’s first truly open governor’s race in 16 years.Saying she plans to seek his support, Mace said, “No one will work harder to get his attention and his endorsement. No one else in this race can say they’ve been there for the president like I have, as much as I have and worked as hard as I have to get the president his agenda delivered to him in the White House.”She pointed to her past efforts in defending Trump, including an interview that led to ABC News paying $15 million toward his presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. She also noted that she called Trump earlier this year to help persuade GOP holdouts to support Rep Mike Johnson as House speaker.Mace has had a complex relationship with Trump. Though she worked for his 2016 campaign, she later criticised him after the January 6 Capitol riot — prompting him to support a primary challenger against her in 2022. Mace ultimately won reelection and went on to receive Trump’s endorsement in her 2024 campaign.“I’m going to draw the line, and I’m going to hold it for South Carolina, and I’m going to put her people first,” Mace said as quoted by Wate News.Mace, 47, briefly served in the South Carolina House before flipping the state’s 1st congressional district in 2020. She also made history as the first Republican woman elected to Congress from South Carolina. Her father served as commandant of cadets at The Citadel during her time there.","Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina officially launched her campaign for governor on Monday.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent far-right Republican and close ally of US President Donald Trump , publicly voiced frustration with her own party, saying it is drifting away from policies that support everyday Americans and mistreating women within its ranks.She said she feels increasingly disconnected from the Republican Party as she continues to clash with both party leadership and Trump on several issues.In a recent interview with The Daily Mail, the Georgia congresswoman shared her views. Greene had previously condemned Israel’s war in Gaza, calling it a “genocide,” opposed Trump’s executive order on artificial intelligence, and demanded the release of the Epstein Files.“I don't know if the Republican Party is leaving me, or if I'm kind of not relating to the Republican Party as much anymore,” Greene said, as quoted by The Independent. “I don't know which one it is.”Greene said the party is turning away from priorities that matter to regular Americans. She criticised the lack of action on cutting foreign aid, the diminished use of the department of government efficiency to reduce federal spending, and the lack of progress on inflation.“Like what happened to all those issues? You know that I don't know what the hell happened with the Republican Party. I really don't,” she said. “But I'll tell you one thing, the course that it's on, I don't want to have anything to do with it, and I just don't care anymore.”Greene has consistently opposed US military aid to Ukraine during the Russia–Ukraine conflict, a policy that remains in place. She has also criticised the administration’s involvement in the Iran–Israel conflict.She noted that since Elon Musk , described as the de facto head of DOGE, left the White House, the administration appears to have shifted focus. While DOGE staffers remain in place throughout the government, reports suggest they now have less authority.Greene also expressed concern that the Republican Party is pushing away younger voters by continuing to back unpopular policies. She added that conservative women may also feel alienated by the way they are treated within the party.“I think there's other women in our party that are really sick and tired of the way men treat Republican women,” Greene said.She cited the case of Representative Elise Stefanik of New York. Trump had nominated Stefanik for US ambassador to the UN, but later withdrew the nomination to preserve the Republican majority in the House. Former national security adviser Mike Waltz was nominated instead.Greene said Stefanik got “screwed” by Speaker Mike Johnson and others in the White House, though she made clear she did not blame the president.Despite her dissatisfaction, Greene did not say she plans to leave the Republican Party.","Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is a prominent far-right Republican and close ally of US President Donald Trump. She said she feels increasingly disconnected from the Republican Party as she continues to clash with both party leadership and Trump on several issues. Greene criticised the lack of action on cutting foreign aid, the diminished use of the department of government efficiency to reduce federal spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123099673,imgsize-890340,width-400,resizemode-4/123099673.jpg"
