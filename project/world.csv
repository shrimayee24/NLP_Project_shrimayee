The districts on high alert are Churachandpur, Tengnoupal, Ukhrul, Kamjong and Pherzawl.Singh said traditional combing operations focus on seizing arms, but there was now ""increased scrutiny"" of materials used to manufacture rockets, missiles, drone components, and batteries.""DMs have been alerted and asked to check stocks of explosives with licensed owners. All connected roads and villages within a 5km radius of the hills are also being checked for stockpiles.""The security adviser said that of the 2,681 weapons seized by security forces since the conflict started, one-third were in the hills and two-thirds in the valley.""The availability of weapons in society in both the hills and the valley is not because of looting (from state armouries and police stations).

The situation calmed only after police authorities assured protesters that a case would be registered against the Kanbhar. Kanbhar went into hiding on Tuesday after being accused of insulting Prophet Muhammad and sharing the content on social media.“Dr Shahnawaz Kanbhar was killed mistakenly in a shootout with cops who did not know it was him,” claimed local police chief Niaz Khoso. Kanbhar is the second blasphemy suspect in Pakistan to be shot dead by police in the span of a week.According to the police report, cops in Mirpur Khas had tried to stop two motorcycle-borne men on Wednesday in order to search their bike.Instead of cooperating, the report said, one of the men opened fire. “A gun battle ensued in which Dr Kanbhar was killed. It was only after the shootout that officers learned that the man they had shot was Dr Kanbhar,” the local police chief claimed, adding the second person on the motorcycle escaped. After the “encounter”, the body was handed over to the family, who brought it to his native village for burial. But there a mob managed to grab the corpse and set it on fire. The slain man is survived by three sons, a daughter, and his widow.Earlier, on Sept 11, a police constable had gunned down blasphemy suspect Adul Ali, a hotel owner, inside a police station in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province in the southwest. Ali was killed a day after a mob attempted to lynch him over blasphemy allegations, prompting police to intervene and take him into custody. He was subsequently shot dead by the constable inside the lockup.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), which expressed “grave concern” over the alleged “extrajudicial killing of two people accused of blasphemy,” strongly condemned the deaths.In a statement issued on Friday, the HRCP said “this pattern of violence in cases of blasphemy, in which law enforcement personnel are allegedly involved, is an alarming trend”.Separately, a Christian woman was sentenced to death by an Islamabad court on Thursday in a blasphemy case brought against her for posting offensive material about Islam in a WhatsApp group.

KOLKATA: Former R G Kar Medical College principal Sandip Ghosh ceases to be a doctor with the West Bengal Medical Council ( WBMC ) cancelling his medical practitioner registration on Thursday. Ghosh, an orthopaedic surgeon, will no more be able to practise unless the cancellation is revoked. The striking off of Ghosh's name happened on a day when various doctor organisations demonstrated in front the council's office demanding cleansing of the council that is mired in controversy.""We have cancelled the registration of Sandip Ghosh as he failed to reply to the show-cause notice even after 13 days,"" said a WBMC official.Council registrar Manas Chakraborti had told TOI on Wednesday that a decision on Ghosh's removal from the council's registration as a medical practitioner was taken and the official notice will be issued by Thursday.Ghosh, who is currently behind the bar and was served a show-cause by the council asking him to reply within three days on Sept 6, was already in CBI custody. He was arrested first on Sept 2 on financial irregularity charges to which the investigation agency added evidence destruction charges on Sept 14.The Thursday notice said that Ghosh's registration is cancelled according to provisions under section 25(a)(ii) of the Bengal Medical Act, 1914 and section 37 (iii) of the Code of Medical Ethics adopted by the council.Since Ghosh was already behind the bar when the notice was served, sources said he could contest the cancellation later as he was not available when the show-cause was served to him.In a letter signed by its president Dilip Kumar Dutta and honorary secretary Sanatnu Sen , IMA West Bengal on Wednesday had shot off a strongly worded letter to the WBMC on why it was delaying on the cancellation of Ghosh's registration.The medical fraternity has been alleging that WBMC is the origin of corrupt practices. Various doctor organisations, including the Joint Platform of Doctors West Bengal, IMA West Bengal and Protect the Warriors, held an agitation at the council's office demanding dissolution of the council and fresh polls to elect new members.""We also wanted to know what the council has done to the likes of Avik De, Birupaksha Biswas and Mustafizur Rehaman. What about its president Sudipto Roy and Sushanta Roy who are under the scanner of investigation agencies,"" said general surgery professor Manas Gumta of Joint Platform of Doctors. The protesting doctors cited a host of reasons as to why the medical council should be dissolved.","The West Bengal Medical Council ( WBMC) cancelled Sandip Ghosh's medical practitioner registration on Thursday.

Springfield: Vivek Ramaswamy hints at Ohio governor run at his Springfield town hall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-hints-at-ohio-governor-run-at-his-springfield-town-hall/articleshow/113534560.cms,"Former Republican presidential candidate Ramaswamy hosted a town hall in Springfield , Ohio, addressing concerns about the migrant crisis . During the event he also hinted at the possibility of running for Ohio governor .Springfield, which has seen an influx of Haitian migrants , has become a focal point in the 2024 race.Ramaswamy opened the event by criticising media narratives.""We've been told, mostly by the media, to shut up, sit down, do as you're told, to sweep it under the rug, or else you're guilty of some sin,""Ramaswamy began the town hall Thursday evening. ""And I just think that the truth in this country is we don't have to agree on everything. We really don't. We never have in America. But the beauty of this country is we should be able to talk about it in the open, and that's what we're going to do tonight.""He acknowledged the migrants' desire to come to the US but criticised ‘federal policies’ under the Biden-Harris administration . He argued that these policies were at fault for the struggles cities like Springfield now face.The town hall was attended by around 200 residents, with an additional 100 in an overflow room.Ramaswamy is a Donald Trump supporter and Ohio native who grew up in nearby Columbus. He met with city officials and Haitian community leaders before the event.Several Springfield residents expressed frustration over the city’s response to the migrant situation.Chrissy, a resident of 66 years, criticized local officials for not organizing a public forum to address concerns.Ramaswamy revealed that city officials had been invited to attend the town hall but didn’t show up, attributing their absence to a ‘culture of fear’ in facing the public.Brock, a longtime Springfield resident, raised concerns about a rise in racial slurs and tensions in the town since it became a focal point of national attention.Ramaswamy stated that he doesn't believe the US is a ""racist country,"" but he acknowledged a recent rise in racial tensions that he feels didn't exist when he was growing up. He connected this increase in bigotry to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) ideology, which he argues fuels more racial division.Another attendee recounted how her daughter was chased out of a Walmart by immigrants, one allegedly carrying a machete. She expressed frustration that the police failed to investigate the incident.Other residents voiced concerns that resources were being allocated to migrants at the expense of local homeless and veterans.The event ended on a light note when Ramaswamy was asked if he would consider running for governor of Ohio, to which he humorously replied, “I’m a little more inclined than I was ten seconds ago,” drawing cheers from the crowd.","Former Republican presidential candidate Ramaswamy hosted a town hall in Springfield, Ohio, addressing concerns about the migrant crisis.

Owens, 46, was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of Irene Graves , a convenience store clerk, during a robbery in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1997.The execution began at 6:35 pm (ET), and at 6:53 pm, a doctor checked for Owens' pulse and pronounced him dead at 6:55 pm, according to state officials.Owens, dressed in a green jumpsuit, had an IV in his arm. He declined to make a final statement but mouthed words to his attorney and said ""bye"" in his final moment of consciousness, according to a Fox news report. Family members of the victim, Irene Graves, were present during the procedure.Owens was executed using a single drug, pentobarbital, which South Carolina obtained under a shield law passed in 2023 that protects the identities of those involved in execution planning and implementation.His final meal included cheeseburgers, a ribeye steak, wings, french fries, strawberry sodas, and apple pie.An official, as quoted by Fox News, said, ""The case of South Carolina against Freddie Owens is complete.""The Supreme Court denied Owens' emergency appeal for a stay of execution, and governor Henry McMaster refused mercy on Friday. Earlier on Thursday, the state Supreme Court rejected a new affidavit from Owens' co-defendant, Steven Golden , who claimed Owens was not present during the robbery and killing. This affidavit contradicted Golden’s previous testimonies and statements to law enforcement.Lawyers of Owens sought a stay of execution, citing due process violations, arguing that he was not provided information about the lethal injection drugs or the qualifications of the execution team.Owens' execution was the first lethal injection carried out by South Carolina since the state regained access to the necessary drugs after nearly a decade of supply shortages.Owens was 19 when he killed Graves during a robbery on Halloween night in 1997. He was convicted in 1999, and during the 24-hour period before sentencing, he killed his cellmate, Christopher Bryan Lee.Owens had confessed to the murder of Graves to several individuals, including law enforcement officers and his girlfriend. He was given the option of choosing between lethal injection, the electric chair, and a firing squad, but his attorney, Emily Paavola, selected lethal injection on his behalf.Attorney Gerald “Bo” King called Owens' death “a tragedy” and maintained that Owens did not kill Graves. King added, as quoted by CNN, “The legal errors, hidden deals, and false evidence that made tonight possible should shame us all.”Owens’ execution was initially scheduled for June 2021 but was delayed due to issues with South Carolina’s execution protocols. This year, 14 people in the US have been executed, all but one by lethal injection.","Freddie Owens, 46, was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of Irene Graves, a convenience store clerk, during a robbery in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1997.

Disciplinary measures for certain personnel are also under consideration. Rowe did not disclose the number of staff facing punishment or their roles but said, “These employees will be held accountable, and this agency has one of the most robust penalty systems in the entire federal government.”Rowe also commented on a second assassination attempt on the former president at a Trump golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, saying, “What occurred on Sunday demonstrates the tremendousthreat environment in which the Secret Service operates, with constant risks.” “We’ve been in this heightened, increasingly dynamic threat environment since July 13,” he added.In response to the shooting, the House voted in favor of a bill requiring the same number of agents to protect presidential nominees as those assigned to the president and vice president. Representative Mike Lawyer said, “In America, elections should be decided at the ballot box, not by an assassin’s bullet.”The Secret Service director confirmed the continued use of tactical assets for party nominees and assured that the agency would not lower its hiring standards despite the increased demands. This year, more than 400 special agents have been hired.Rowe did not comment on security arrangements for Trump’s attendance at the Alabama vs Georgia football game on Saturday but noted, “Each event is complex.”In a recent assassination attempt on the Republican presidential candidate, the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, camped outside Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course for nearly 12 hours with food and a rifle. He was allegedly aiming the rifle at the green from a sniper’s nest before being caught by a secret service agent.On July 13, 2024, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, opened fire from a nearby roof, grazing Trump’s ear, wounding two others, and killing one attendee before being shot by a Secret Service sniper at a Pennsylvania rally.","The Secret Service admitted on Friday to communication errors and a lack of diligence when Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally in July.

That’s kind of fun,” he said, explaining that he voted “against crazy,” without revealing his choice for president.This early voting period follows a politically turbulent summer. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, and Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in as the Democratic nominee.Meanwhile, Republican candidate Donald Trump survived two assassination attempts in a span of nine weeks.Voters experienced long queues as they cast their ballots on national, state, and local levels.In Minnesota and South Dakota, voters are only able to submit absentee ballots in person, as mail-in voting is not an option at this stage.The political climate has led election officials nationwide to increase security to protect polling sites and workers, with federal authorities investigating suspicious packages sent to election offices in over 15 states, including Virginia.Minnesota’s Secretary of State Steve Simon, who also leads the National Association of Secretaries of State, emphasised his hopes for a smooth voting process. “If I could wave a magic wand, I’d wish for high turnout and low drama,” Simon said during a press conference.Some voters cited concerns about potential chaos on Election Day.Chris Burda, a 74-year-old Minneapolis resident, voted early for Harris, praising her for defending democracy. She encouraged others to vote early to avoid possible disruptions at polling sites.While Trump has historically criticised mail-in voting, this year he and the Republican National Committee have promoted early and mail-in voting as a way to secure GOP votes.Eugene Otteson, a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran, cast his ballot for Trump, stating, “I don’t like him, but he’s a businessman, and I like someone who can run a business.”In contrast, Rocklyn Faher, a 70-year-old retired Navy aviation electrician from Norfolk, Virginia, voted for Harris.He became emotional as he spoke about the stakes of this election, calling it “the most important election in the last 100 years,” and emphasising the need to protect the Constitution for his grandchildren’s future.Meanwhile, in South Dakota, early voters turned out steadily, with local election officials noting a busier-than-usual first day. Voters in the state will also weigh in on contentious ballot initiatives, including abortion rights and marijuana legalisation.Amid concerns about postal service delays, officials are urging voters to cast ballots early to ensure they are counted on time.","Virginia became the first state to kick off in-person voting on Friday, with early polling sites open until November 2.

"First pagers, now walkie-talkies: Lebanon on edge after new wave of explosions kill 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hezbollah-war-mossad-pager-explosions-walkie-talkies-explosions/articleshow/113474697.cms,"Driving the news

Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The two main devices responsible for the carnage — pagers and walkie-talkies—were in widespread use by Hezbollah operatives.

These seemingly mundane objects detonated across the country in a coordinated wave of attacks, with security experts pointing fingers at Israel.

As per a report in Aljazeera, exploding devices include portable two-way radios, laptops, and even certain solar power setups. ""There are reports of several different devices blowing up.""

A number of vehicles have also reportedly burst into flames. However, it remains uncertain whether these explosions originated from the cars themselves or from objects within the vehicles.

The explosions have not only claimed lives but also unleashed panic and chaos as people fear more devices could still be rigged to explode.

Thousands of Lebanese residents have been directly affected by the blasts, which have targeted Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon.

At the same time, explosions have hit civilian areas, including shops, homes, and even hospitals. This attack represents the largest security breach in Hezbollah’s history, marking a new phase of violence between Hezbollah and Israel, who have been engaged in escalating hostilities for years.

Why it matters

The scale and sophistication of these attacks have exposed Hezbollah’s vulnerabilities in a way that few anticipated. With Israel being blamed for the operation, the explosions have dramatically heightened tensions in a region already on edge due to ongoing conflicts between Israel, Hamas , and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment.

, and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment. As per a news report from Reuters, Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad , was behind serial explosions in pagers.

, was behind serial explosions in pagers. The orchestration of the pager bombings seemed to be an intricate undertaking that required several months of preparation. Numerous specialists suspect that Mossad tampered with the supply chain, planting explosives in hundreds of pagers prior to their importation into Lebanon. However, concrete evidence supporting this theory remains scarce at present.

Gold Apollo , a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction.

, a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction. Kovács further disclosed on X that Hungary's national security services were actively collaborating with international partners in the investigation.

The chaos unleashed by these attacks threatens to destabilize Lebanon further, a country already grappling with economic collapse, political turmoil, and the lingering aftermath of the 2020 Beirut port explosion.

The big picture

The attacks began when thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously across Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

The next day, a second wave of explosions from walkie-talkies and solar panels caused more devastation, killing 14 more and wounding hundreds. Lebanese media have reported that some of the dead include children and civilians who were nowhere near Hezbollah operations at the time of the explosions.

Hezbollah officials have publicly condemned Israel, accusing it of committing “mass murder.” Iran, Hezbollah’s chief backer, has also blamed Israel and vowed retribution. Meanwhile, Israel has remained tight-lipped but has declared the start of a ""new phase"" in its ongoing war with Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflict involving Iran and its allies.

In a Daily Mail report, journalist Hassan Harfoush shared chilling firsthand accounts of the devastation. ""The scenes here in Lebanon are from a horror film—fleshless faces, eyes hanging out. With dozens dead and thousands hurt, none of us feel safe,"" he wrote.

""Beirut has collapsed into panic. The WhatsApp groups are going non-stop. There are wild rumours doing the rounds that solar panels might explode, batteries, fridges – anything. There's fake news saying phones have exploded. I know it's stupid but I even told my parents to get a fire extinguisher, just in case ­something blows up in the house,"" Harfoush wrote in the Daily Mail, echoing the fear that has swept the country.

What they are saying

Lebanese residents, gripped by panic, have taken drastic steps to protect themselves. Some have begun tearing the batteries out of their walkie-talkies and throwing them into the streets, terrified that the devices could explode at any moment. In some areas, residents have turned off Wi-Fi routers and unplugged home appliances out of fear they could also be rigged to detonate.

At Beirut hospitals, doctors are struggling to keep up with the flood of patients. ""We are seeing horrific injuries,"" said Dr Elias Warrak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital. ""In the last 24 hours, we’ve had more than 60 to 70 percent of patients needing at least one eye removed."" Many of the injuries involve gruesome shrapnel wounds to the face, hands, and eyes, leaving many permanently disfigured.

At a funeral for victims of the first wave of explosions, panic struck again when walkie-talkies detonated during the ceremony. Attendees fled in terror as ambulances rushed to the scene. ""The Hezbollah officials present behaved as if nothing had happened, but all of us felt it, heard it,"" Harfoush recalled. This latest wave of violence has shattered any remaining sense of security in Beirut and beyond.

Zoom in

The Lebanese armed forces have been called in to conduct controlled explosions of any suspicious devices. In one instance, soldiers detonated a bag of rice at the American University of Beirut Medical Centre, fearing it had been rigged with explosives. The Lebanese army is also working to neutralize compromised solar panels and radios, but the sheer number of devices in circulation makes the task daunting.

Images of exploded walkie-talkies and pagers show them labeled with “ICOM” and “Made in Japan.” While the devices appear to be from the Japanese electronics firm ICOM, the company has denied any involvement, saying that the specific models used in the attacks were discontinued in 2014. Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo has also distanced itself, saying that its pagers had been licensed to a Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, which acted as an intermediary.

Between the lines

Experts believe the devices were likely tampered with before they were delivered to Hezbollah, indicating a long-term infiltration of the group’s supply chain. Some security sources have suggested that small explosives were hidden inside the devices and remotely triggered, possibly through radio frequencies. This level of sophistication suggests the involvement of a state actor, with Israel’s Mossad being the most likely culprit.

The psychological impact of the explosions has been devastating. ""People used to think that if they were affiliated with Hezbollah but not fighters, they were safe. But this changes everything,"" said a Hezbollah source. Civilians who once believed they were outside the conflict’s direct line of fire are now terrified that their homes, shops, or workplaces could become the next target.

What’s next

The situation remains highly volatile, with Hezbollah vowing to retaliate. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to make a public address, possibly outlining the group’s plans for retaliation.

Meanwhile, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has warned that Israel is just beginning its ""new phase"" of war, which could see more aggressive military actions in the coming days.

There is a growing fear that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into a full-scale regional war, drawing in other countries such as Iran and Syria. Meanwhile, residents in Lebanon are left wondering whether any electronic device could be the next to explode.

Lebanon is reeling from a second wave of deadly explosions targeting electronic devices used by Hezbollah , just a day after hundreds of the militant group's pagers detonated simultaneously. The latest attacks, which are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, have heightened fears of an all-out war between the two sides. The explosions have also raised concerns about the extent of potentially compromised devices, especially given the high number of civilian casualties.(With inputs from agencies)","Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The 37-year-old was believed to have been stabbed to death, and a man has been arrested in connection with the crime, as reported by Georgian media.Abramidze, 37, was one of Georgia 's first openly transgender public figures.The law includes bans on same-sex marriages and gender-affirming treatments, and it allows officials to ban Pride events and censor films and books.The new legislation, which passed its third and final reading in parliament on Tuesday, has been controversial. Critics say it mirrors anti-LGBTQ+ measures in Russia. Civil society groups in Georgia have linked Abramidze's death to a broader state campaign against minorities.""There is a direct correlation between the use of hate speech in politics and hate crimes,"" the Social Justice Center , a Tbilisi-based human rights group, said. The group added, ""It has been almost a year that the Georgian Dream government has been aggressively using homo/bi/transphobic language and cultivating it with mass propaganda means.""Under the Georgian Dream party, which has become more anti-liberal, violence against LGBTQ+ people has increased. Last year, opponents of gay rights disrupted an LGBTQ+ festival in Tbilisi, forcing it to be canceled. This year, a large march promoting ""traditional family values"" took place, attended by the ruling party and the Orthodox church. European Union officials and other critics have warned that the new law could harm Georgia's EU membership aspirations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, urged the Georgian government to withdraw the law. ""It would increase discrimination & stigmatisation,"" he said.Michael Roth, chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee in Germany, said, ""Those who sow hatred will reap violence. Kesaria Abramidze was killed just one day after the Georgian parliament passed the anti-LGBTI law.""The law's passage is seen by some as a potential shift in Georgia's stance toward Russia, especially with parliamentary elections coming up in five weeks. Georgia’s pro-western president, Salome Zourabichvili, is expected to veto the law, although parliament has enough votes to override her veto.Abramidze had a significant presence online and represented Georgia at Miss Trans Star International in 2018. Tributes have been pouring in for her. Maia Otarashvili, a Georgian political scientist, called her ""a trailblazer for Georgia’s trans rights.""President Zourabichvili said Abramidze's murder should be a ""wake-up call"" for society.

The move comes after the couple petitioned the Islamabad High Court to stay the proceedings and sought acquittal.The Al-Qadir Trust case centers on accusations that Khan and his wife caused a loss of over Rs 50 billion to the national exchequer.An anti-corruption court has been overseeing the trial, where so far, the statements of 35 witnesses have been recorded, leaving only the investigating officer to be cross-examined by the defense.A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Amir Farooq heard the plea on Wednesday. Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid. They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing. The case stems from a March 2023 NAB probe into the Al-Qadir University Trust, alleging that Khan and his wife received large sums of money and real estate from Malik Riaz Hussain, a real estate magnate, in exchange for Rs 50 billion. The amount had been part of a settlement with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and later adjusted against a Supreme Court fine imposed on Hussain.","Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seek acquittal.

Shiva Kachi, a Hindu community leader from Hyderabad, said, ""We are getting information about such incidents nearly every week now from different parts of the province and no one seems to care.There is so much fear in the Hindu community now.""Kachi heads the Pakistan Darewar Ittehad , an organisation which is fighting for the recovery of Hindu girls kidnapped, allegedly forcibly converted to Islam and married off to Muslim men who are much older in many instances.In the recent days there have been two incidents in Khairpur and Mirpurkhas of two girls being abducted from their homes by armed men, he said.In the first instance, a 16-year-old girl was kidnapped from her home in Khairpur while a class 7th student was abducted from Digri town near Mirpurkhas.Kachi said in the first case, a Muslim youth claimed she eloped with him and married him after converting to Islam.He said the Pakistan government and provincial authorities needed to place safeguards to ensure the safety of the Hindu community.Ramesh Kumar, a social activist from Hyderabad city, claims once the girls are abducted, even the police don't cooperate and refuse to file FIRs on behalf of the affected families who are mostly uneducated and poor.""There is a nexus between some clerics, policemen and influential Muslims and the Hindu community suffers,"" he claimed.Hindus are not the only minority who claim they are discriminated against and face injustice. On Tuesday, an Ahmadi family (Ahmadiyyas are declared non-Muslims in Pakistan) saw their under-construction house vandalised in Karachi's Shah Faisal colony.""Everything was okay. We've been constructing the house for the last few months but yesterday someone spread the rumour that Ahmadis were building a worship place and today a mob came and badly damaged the under-construction building,"" Shahid Ahmed said.In many instances, the 500,000-strong Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan don't reveal themselves openly for fear of repercussions.Kumar also referred to the incident of firing in a Hindu temple, Rama Par, in Hyderabad city and said so far the police were delaying arresting all those responsible for entering the temple and opening fire during a religious ceremony.Scores of Hindus held a protest on Monday in Hyderabad demanding the arrest of those responsible for the alleged assault on the temple in which five people were injured.""Police have filed complaints against 11 people but made just two arrests,"" he said.A religious ceremony was taking place at the temple when a scuffle broke out between two groups of the Hindu community and this led to the involvement of outsiders who came and opened fire in the temple while the ceremony had not finished.","Two Hindu girls have been abducted from their homes in Pakistan's southern Sindh province in recent days.

Militants in Pakistan used PUBG features to attack police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/militants-in-pakistan-used-pubg-features-to-attack-police-station/articleshow/113390618.cms,"Militants in Swat , Pakistan, utilized features from the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) to plan and execute an attack on a local police station, reported Dawn.Militants targeted the Banr police station in Swat on August 28, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to two others. In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
