Vice President joins the debate

What the Washington Post report said

NEW DELHI: The Congress party has intensified its attack on the BJP, demanding answers over US President Donald Trump’s claim that he gave $21 million to 'friend' Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost voter turnout in India.At a press conference on Saturday, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera ridiculed the BJP’s silence, calling the controversy “a matter between two friends.” He accused the ruling party of benefiting from foreign funds and questioned where the alleged money went.“Trump’s statement proves he sent this money to Modi to influence elections. Since we have been questioning voter turnout trends, is this increase due to foreign funds?” Khera asked, demanding a White Paper on funds received by political parties and cultural outfits.Citing a Washington Post report debunking claims of US funding for India’s elections, Khera alleged that the RSS-BJP ecosystem has been making ""wild allegations"" against civil society while benefiting from USAID funds. He pointed out that USAID disbursed $650 million to India between FY 2021 and FY 2024 and questioned its purpose.The Congress leader further highlighted past USAID disbursements, linking them to key political developments, including the rise of Modi as BJP’s PM candidate and the formation of AAP. “Who benefitted from these funds?” he asked, urging legal action against those spreading ""fake narratives"" to mislead the nation.The controversy erupted after Elon Musk’s DOGE platform claimed it had canceled a $21 million USAID grant supposedly meant to boost voter participation in India. Trump quickly amplified the claim, alleging that US taxpayer money was being used to interfere in India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Despite The Washington Post's findings, Trump has continued repeating the allegations without evidence. He recently remarked, “Why do we need to spend USD 21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they (the Biden administration) were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government.”The Congress has urged that the proposed white paper on foreign funding not be restricted to USAID but should cover all financial assistance from foreign entities operating under law. Congress insisted PM Modi must directly refute what it called ""baseless"" allegations.""The RSS-BJP and their ecosystem are fabricating narratives against credible civil society groups, NGOs, and political parties. These actors must not only be named and shamed but also face legal consequences for misleading the nation,"" said Pawan Khera.Congress also dismissed the BJP’s claims linking a 2012 agreement between the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) to foreign electoral influence.""The IFES was engaged by the ECI to develop a curriculum on election management, not to interfere in Indian elections,"" Khera clarified. ""The training material was used for electoral officials worldwide, not for domestic polls. The ECI’s website states that 69,362 officials from 109 countries have been trained under this initiative.""Earlier, Khera had taken to social media to mock the BJP, saying: “In this latest expose on the so-called US funding to increase voter turnout in India, The Washington Post confirms that no such program existed and no such funding was received. For the BJP and its blind supporters, crow is part of their daily diet. Who else will eat crow after this comedy of errors?”The BJP, on the other hand, has been on the offensive, accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of seeking foreign intervention to unseat Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The party has yet to respond to the Washington Post report dismissing the USAID funding claim.The BJP, however, dismissed the media report as a ""cover-up"" and branded Rahul Gandhi a ""traitor"" for allegedly seeking external influence in India's electoral process. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia alleged that the Congress facilitated foreign interference during its tenure, claiming that over $2,000 million in USAID funding entered India between 2004 and 2013, while only $1.5 million was received under Modi’s rule.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has responded to the controversy surrounding USAID funding in India, calling the allegations concerning and stating that the government is examining the matter. His remarks come amid claims by Trump that $21 million was sent to India to boost voter turnout in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections—a claim dismissed by The Washington Post.“Some information has been put out there by the Trump administration people, and obviously, that is concerning. I think, as a government, we're looking into it. My sense is that the facts will come out,” Jaishankar said.He emphasized that USAID was allowed to operate in India in good faith, but recent allegations from the US suggest otherwise. “USAID was allowed here in good faith, to do good faith activities. Now, suggestions are being laid out from America that there are activities which are in bad faith. It’s worrisome, and if there’s something to it, then the country should know who the people involved are,” he added.On Friday, US President Donald Trump raised the issue of $21 million funding for 'voter turnout in India' for the third day in a row and questioned why such substantial amount was being spent abroad when similar efforts could be made towards boosting voter turnout in United States.Trump, who had earlier hinted that the funds might have been used to interfere in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections without giving any evidence, took the Prime Minister's name in his latest remark. ""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout. We're giving 21 million for voter turnout in India. What about us? I want voter turnout too,"" Trump said.While the BJP has accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of seeking foreign intervention to defeat Modi, the ruling party has yet to respond to The Washington Post’s report debunking the USAID funding claim. The opposition, meanwhile, is demanding answers from Modi and the Election Commission on the matter.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal expressed concerns over foreign interference, stating that authorities were examining USAID’s financial activities. ""We have seen information put out by the US administration regarding certain US activities and funding. These are obviously very deeply troubling,"" Jaiswal said at a press briefing.Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar voiced concerns over foreign funding’s impact on India's electoral process, urging those responsible to be ""shamed and brought to book."" He called the controversy a ""political Covid"" designed to weaken Indian democracy.According to The Washington Post, the false claim originated when DOGE alleged that USAID had allocated $21 million to India as part of a broader $486 million payment to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS), a USAID-funded coalition of non-profits working on democratic governance and electoral processes. However, the report, citing three officials familiar with US aid initiatives, stated that no such program existed in India.“We were all shocked to see that claim from DOGE. We don’t know anything about elections in India because we have never been involved,” a USAID official told The Washington Post.Another US official suggested that Musk’s department might have misrepresented the numbers from other programs, saying, “They seem to be conflating figures from unrelated initiatives.”Despite these clarifications, Trump has doubled down on his claims, repeatedly questioning why US funds were allegedly being spent on voter turnout in India. Earlier this week, he remarked, ""Why do we need to spend USD 21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they (the Biden administration) were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government.""","Congress demands wider probe into foreign funding, calls out Modi on Trump’s claim that he gave $21 million to 'friend' Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost voter turnout in India.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday raised the issue of $21 million funding for ' voter turnout in India ' for the third day in a row and questioned why such substantial amount was being spent abroad when similar efforts could be made towards boosting voter turnout in United States.During his address at the Governors working session, Trump also criticised funding of $29 million to a firm to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh .""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout. We're giving 21 million for voter turnout in India. What about us? I want voter turnout too,"" Trump said.""$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh went to a firm that nobody ever heard of. Got 29 million. They got a check. Can you imagine? You have a little firm, you get 10,000 here, 10,000 there, and then we get 29 million from the United States government. There are two people working in that firm. Two people. I think they're very happy, they're very rich. They'll be on the cover of a very good business magazine pretty soon for being great,"" he added. Bharatiya Janata Party IT cell chief Amit Malviya shared Trump's remarks in a social media post on X and took a swipe at the opposition.""For the third day in a row, US President Donald Trump reiterated his claim about USAID funding efforts to promote voter turnout in India. But what does he know about his own country’s spending? "" Malviya said.This comes amid Trump's ongoing attack on the USAID to strengthen democracy by giving aides to different countries. Earlier, Trump claimed that US was trying to get somebody else elected in India.""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected,"" Trump said.""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.A day later, Trump called the alleged funding a kickback scheme and said that nobody has any idea of what is going on there.""And $21 million for voter turnout in India. Why are we caring about India turnout? We got enough problems. We want our own turnout, don't we? Can you imagine all that money going to India? I wonder what they think when they get it. Now, it's a kickback scheme. You know, it's not like they get it and they spend, they kick it back to the people that send it. I would say in many cases, many of these cases, anytime you have no idea what we're talking about, that means there's a kickback because nobody has any idea what's going on there,"" he said.Also read : 'Deeply troubling': India investigating US funding claims amid foreign interference concerns, says MEA ""$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.

MANGALURU: In an alleged case of medical negligence, a doctor at a Mangaluru hospital left a surgical mop inside a woman's stomach during a C-section, putting her life in danger and requiring an emergency, life-saving surgery at another hospital two months later, after a CT scan exposed the doctor's carelessness. She is still not able to breastfeed her newborn.""We have undergone tremendous stress. We have posted the issue on National Consumer Grievance portal and Department of Consumer Affairs. We have spent lakhs of rupees on her treatment,"" the woman's husband said.Dakshina Kannada district health and family welfare officer Dr Thimmaiah H R said that a thorough probe would be conducted into the complaint.Recounting the ordeal, the husband posted on X that his wife underwent a C-section on Nov 27 at a private hospital, but a week after she was discharged on Dec 2, she developed a high fever and had to be readmitted to the hospital. Concerned about an unusual sensation on one side of her stomach, the couple insisted on an ultrasound scan, which revealed a 10 cm mass.However, the radiologist allegedly refused to disclose its details to the patient or communicate with the treating doctor in their presence. The doctor, in turn, dismissed their concerns, claiming it was a hematoma rather than a foreign object.As the discomfort persisted, the couple requested a CT scan for clarification, but the doctor reportedly disregarded the suggestion, insisting the condition would resolve over time. Although the woman's fever eventually subsided, follow-up ultrasounds showed no reduction in the mass. Meanwhile, she began experiencing severe joint, wrist, and leg pain, making it difficult for her to walk, stand, or even lift her baby to feed.A CT scan later confirmed the presence of a surgical mop inside her stomach. By then, the infection had spread to her lungs, blood, and other organs, putting her life at grave risk, her husband alleged. When the couple confronted the doctor who had performed the C-section, he allegedly refused to take responsibility.Ultimately, an emergency surgery was performed at another private hospital in Mangaluru's Puttur on Jan 25 to remove the mop. She was discharged on Feb 15, though she is still on medication.","A doctor at a Mangaluru hospital left a surgical mop inside a woman's stomach during a C-section, putting her life in danger.

RANCHI/KOCHI: A Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) exam topper whose career got caught in a protracted legal tangle and a CBI probe into the fairness of the selection process was found dead with her IRS officer brother and their mother in a govt accommodation in Kerala's Kochi on Friday, six days after she failed to appear for a court hearing in Ranchi.Shalini Vijay , assistant director in the Jharkhand social welfare department, was on leave since 2020. She and her brother Manish Vijay, additional commissioner of central excise and customs in Kochi, are suspected to have entered into a suicide pact along with their mother Shakuntala.The matriarch's body was found covered in a white cloth with petals sprinkled all over, leading investigators to presume she died before the siblings purportedly took their lives in separate rooms of Manish's official quarters at Eechamukk in Kochi's Kakkanad neighbourhood.Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility of Shakuntala dying of any natural cause before her son and daughter hanged themselves. ""We will know the details for sure, including the time of death, only after the autopsies,"" said assistant CP (Thrikkakara) P V Baby.Manish's colleagues were the first to find the bodies when they visited the house to check on him as he was supposed to resume work the previous day after a period of leave but was incommunicado.Police found a note in Manish' diary, dated Feb 15, with an instruction to hand over some documents to his younger sister, who is currently in Dubai. The note mentions her phone number. ""She will be arriving soon after the autopsies, which most likely will be done on Saturday,"" a police officer said.Shalini was the topper among 64 civil servants recruited through JPSC's first combined exam in 2003.Some candidates who didn't make the cut challenged the recruitment process soon after, pointing out that many of those who cleared the exam were linked to politicians or officials. As the state probe dragged on, Jharkhand HC had the case transferred to CBI in 2022.CBI filed charges against Shalini and the other recruits under sections 420 (cheating), 423 (fraudulent documentation) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC, among other offences, along with 13(2) and 13(1)(D) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The next hearing is scheduled for Feb 27.The Vijay family lived in a rented house in Ranchi until 2013.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also attacked the Congress party for ""resorting to conspiracies"" and ""maligning India's democracy"".""When people don’t vote for them (Congress), they resort to conspiracies, using foreign money to influence India’s elections. They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" The BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.

BERLIN: German voters head to the polls on Sunday, with the conservatives the strong favourites after a campaign rocked by a far-right surge and the dramatic return of US President Donald Trump.Frontrunner Friedrich Merz has vowed a tough rightward shift if elected to win back voters from the far-right anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is eyeing a record result after a string of deadly attacks blamed on asylum seekers.If he takes over from embattled centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as widely predicted given a yawning poll gap, the CDU leader has promised a ""strong voice"" in Europe at a time of chaotic disruption.The pivotal vote in the European Union's biggest economy comes amid tectonic upheaval in US-Europe ties sparked by Trump's direct outreach to Russian President Vladimir Putin over their heads to end the Ukraine war.Across Europe, NATO allies worry about the future of the alliance, nowhere more than in Germany which grew prosperous under the US-led security umbrella.However, it may take Merz many weeks to negotiate a coalition government, spelling yet more political paralysis in Berlin during such fraught time.In a strange twist to the polarised campaign, the AfD has basked in the glowing support lavished on it by Trump's entourage, with billionaire Elon Musk touting it as the only party to ""save Germany"".Trump, asked about the elections in Germany, which he has berated over its trade, migration and defence policies, said dismissively that ""I wish them luck, we got our own problems"".Merz, in his final CDU/CSU campaign event in Munich on Saturday, said Europe needed to walk tall to be able to ""sit at the main table"" of the world powers.Voicing strong confidence, the 69-year-old former investment lawyer told supporters that ""we will win the elections and then the nightmare of this government will be over"".""There is no left majority and no left politics anymore in Germany,"" Merz told a raucous beer hall, promising to tighten border controls and revive flagging Germany Inc.- Trade war feared -For the next German leader, more threats loom from the United States, long its bedrock ally, if Trump sparks a trade war that could hammer Germany's recession-hit economy.Scholz will stay in charge as caretaker until any new multi-party government takes shape -- a task which Merz has already said he hopes to achieve by Easter in two months.Polling stations open at 8:00 am (0700 GMT) with more than 59 million Germans eligible to vote and first estimates based on exit polls expected after polls close at 6:00 pm (1700 GMT).Up to 30 percent of voters remained undecided last week, among them Sylvia Otto, 66, who said that ""I still find it difficult to make a decision this time"".Speaking in Berlin, she said she wanted ""a change -- but now a change to the right. That's very important to me"".At an AfD rally elsewhere in Berlin, a 49-year-old engineer, who gave his name only as Christian, praised the party's leader Alice Weidel as a ""tough woman, stepping on the toes of the other parties"".These, he said, ""are now adopting the AfD's programmes and passing them off as their own. So she is doing something right.""- 'Save Germany' -Germany's political crisis was sparked when Scholz's unhappy coalition collapsed on November 6, the day Trump was re-elected.Scholz's SPD, the Greens and the liberal FDP had long quarrelled over tight finances.The SPD's historically low polls ratings of around 15 percent suggest Scholz paid the price for policy gridlock and Germany's parlous economic performance at a time the Ukraine war sent energy prices through the roof.Frustration with the leadership fuelled the rise of the AfD, which has been polling at 20 percent but looks set to stay in opposition as all other parties have vowed to keep it out of power.The AfD, strongest in the ex-communist east, is on track for its best-ever result after Germany was shocked by a series of high-profile attacks in which the suspects were asylum seekers.In December a car-ramming through a Christmas market crowd killed six people and wounded hundreds, with a Saudi man arrested at the scene.More deadly attacks followed, both blamed on Afghan asylum seekers: a stabbing spree targeting kindergarten children and another car-ramming attack in Munich.On Friday, a Syrian man who police said wanted to ""kill Jews"" was arrested after a Spanish tourist was stabbed in the neck at Berlin's Holocaust memorial.While Merz has vowed to shutter German borders and lock up those awaiting deportation, the AfD has argued that Germans will ""vote for the original"".","German voters head to the polls on Sunday, with the conservatives the strong favourites.

AHMEDABAD: A dispute over a Rs 50,000 loan escalated into an attempted murder case, with Madhavpura police registering a complaint after a man was stabbed. The incident stemmed from the borrower's failure to repay the debt.In a complaint filed on Saturday, a 34-year-old man stated that he had borrowed Rs 50,000 in cash from a local moneylender residing in Dudeshwar. He had initially agreed to repay the loan in instalments.

Colourful coalitions

BERLIN: Germany holds elections on Sunday after its three-party ""traffic light"" coalition collapsed last year and could soon have a ""black-red"" government while a ""Jamaica"" or ""blackberry"" alliance is less likely.Confused? Here is a cheat sheet for Germany's colour-coded party politics ahead of the pivotal vote in Europe's most populous country and biggest economy.Every German party is traditionally associated with a colour, and national flags and other imagery are commonly used as shorthand for possible coalition combinations.Here are Germany's main parties, their colours, leaders and what they stand for:The centre-left party of embattled Chancellor Olaf Scholz, 66, is Germany's oldest with origins in a labour association founded in the mid-1800s.Its key demands are fair wages, safe pensions and social benefits, and its symbol is a red rose.The SPD prides itself on its principled opposition to the Nazis before it was banned and its members exiled.Party lore says that dialogue with Moscow, rather than confrontation, helped end the Cold War.Prominent former SPD chancellors include Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder.Germany's main conservative party, led by former corporate lawyer Friedrich Merz, 69, prioritises boosting the economy, law and order and traditional social values.Merz has promised to steer the party back to its right-wing roots, away from the more centrist course charted by former chancellor Angela Merkel.He has vowed to strongly restrict irregular immigration and perhaps bring back nuclear energy, phased out under Merkel.The CDU is in a permanent alliance with Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) led by Markus Soeder.Well-known former CDU chancellors include the first post-WWII leader Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, dubbed the father of Germany's 1990 reunification.The FDP, which promotes liberal economic policies and small government, was long Germany's main ""third party"" and has had a key role in building and bringing down governments.Its leader, former finance minister Christian Lindner, 46, provoked the government crisis that came to a head when Scholz fired him on November 6.The turmoil recalled a 1982 power play when the FDP switched sides, bringing down Schmidt, who was replaced by Kohl.The FDP is sometimes mocked as the party of the rich but sees itself as a watchdog against government overreach, bureaucracy and red tape.The Greens emerged from the environmental, anti-nuclear and peace protest movement of the 1970s.Its first MPs were elected in the early 1980s and they shocked the staid Bundestag when they showed up in knitted pullovers and put their feet on the benches.However, the party has since firmly entered the mainstream and advocates strong military support for Ukraine against Russia.The current alliance was built in 1993 with activist groups from the formerly communist East Germany.Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, 55, is the top election candidate of the Greens, which is also the party of Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.The far-right party started off a decade ago as a eurosceptic fringe party but has since embraced a virulent anti-immigration agenda.It railed against Merkel's 2015 green light to allow in more than a million migrants, many from war-torn Syria.AfD politicians tend to doubt climate change, hold pro-Moscow positions and support US President Donald Trump whose ally Elon Musk has strongly backed the AfD.Some AfD key figures have used Nazi-era phrases, and the domestic security services consider elements in the party to be extremists, fuelling calls to ban it.With its top candidate Alice Weidel, 46, the AfD has been polling at around 20 per cent, with most of its support in the ex-communist east.All other parties have committed to an anti-AfD ""firewall"" of non-cooperation, although Merz breached this in late January when he accepted AfD support in parliament to pass a motion calling for an immigration crackdown.Germany's two far-left parties have hovered around the five-percent cutoff mark for reentry into parliament.Die Linke has enjoyed a late poll surge above that mark, boosted by a spirited anti-fascist speech by its top candidate Heidi Reichinnek, 36.The Linke's former leading figure, Sahra Wagenknecht, 55, left last year to form her own ""left-wing conservative"" BSW, which is sceptical of immigration.Wagenknecht, who grew up in the communist East, promotes anti-capitalist views and opposes NATO, has struggled to maintain the initial buzz around her new party.Scholz's collapsed red-yellow-green coalition was dubbed the ""traffic light"" government.In 2017 Germany almost got a black-yellow-green ""Jamaica"" coalition, before the FDP pulled out of talks.Polling suggests Germany could next be headed for a CDU-led ""black-red"" grand coalition with the SPD that may need a third partner.If the FDP were to join in, their colours would match the national flag of a ""Germany"" coalition.If instead, the Greens joined, this would lead to a black-red-green ""Kenya"" coalition.Also seen at the state level before, but highly unlikely at the national level, is a black-red-violet alliance of the CDU, SPD and BSW, dubbed the ""blackberry"".","Every German party is traditionally associated with a colour, and national flags and other imagery are commonly used as

A boat carrying 19 South American migrants blocked from entering the United States sank off the coast of Panama as they returned to their home countries, leaving an 8-year-old Venezuelan girl dead, authorities said Saturday.The boat went down Friday night ""due to strong waves caused by bad weather"" in Caribbean waters off northeast Panama, the country's Senafront border service said.Aboard were migrants from Venezuela and Colombia, and two crew members. Aside from the girl who died, the others were all rescued, Senafront said.""The event occurred in the context of the reverse migratory flow ,"" the agency said.The migrants were returning home from Mexico and Central American countries after giving up on trying to enter the United States amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal entries.They were traveling by boat to avoid crossing Panama's treacherous Darien jungle, with dangers including fast-flowing rivers, wild animals and criminal gangs.UN children's agency UNICEF expressed its ""solidarity"" with those affected by the incident, stressing in a statement ""the importance of safety in transit through Panama.""On Friday, AFP witnessed several boats departing from a rudimentary dock at the port of Carti in northern Panama, with dozens of migrants onboard.""What else were we going to do but return (home)?"" a Venezuelan migrant said of the decision.""We've been stranded for over 15 days, going round and round from Mexico to here (Panama) and scraping together money out of nowhere.""Senafront said the doomed boat was in a group of three bound for La Miel, a Panamanian town on the border with Colombia. Two suspended their trips due to bad weather, but one continued ahead.""That decision led to the unfortunate incident,"" the border police said.Since Trump took office on January 20, hundreds of South American migrants denied entry to the United States have begun the arduous journey back home, traveling in stages by foot, bus or boat and passing through shelters along the way.","The boat went down Friday night ""due to strong waves caused by bad weather"" The migrants were returning home from Mexico and Central American countries.

US President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday, where he discussed mass deportations and his efforts to reshape the federal government.Addressing a packed hall near Washington, Trump said he was removing government officials and sending back undocumented immigrants.""The fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists, and Deep State bureaucrats are being sent packing. The illegal alien criminals are being sent home. We're draining the swamp and restoring government by the people, for the people,"" he said.Trump was welcomed with chants of ""USA!

Wearing a blue suit, he stood before supporters wearing red hats with the slogan of his "" Make America Great Again "" (MAGA) movement.He spoke about his efforts to change the structure of the federal government, including firing federal workers and making changes to international development agencies.""For years, Washington was controlled by a sinister group of radical left Marxists, warmongers and corrupt special interests who drained our wealth, attacked our liberties, obliterated our borders and sucked our country dry— not any longer,"" he said.""We have escorted the radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and have locked the doors behind them,"" he added.

Newly appointed FBI chief Kash Patel is set to be appointed to lead US bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosive (ATF), Fox News reported citing two sources.This comes after attorney general Pam Bondi dismissed ATF general counsel Pamela Hicks on Thursday following US President Donald Trump ordered the removal of all remaining Biden-era US Attorneys.Hicks confirmed her exit from ATF in a Linkedin post and said, “I was served official notice from the Attorney General of the United States that I was being removed from my position as the Chief Counsel of ATF and my employment with the department of justice terminated.”Hicks left the department after completing her 28 years of service. She has also served as the attorney for the Department of Justice.“Serving as ATF Chief Counsel has been the highest honor of my career and working with the people at ATF and throughout the Department has been a pleasure. I thank my colleagues for their friendship and partnership over the years,” Hicks further said in her social media post.Patel's nomination for FBI chief faced opposition from Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, however, he received backing from the rest of the Republican Party, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had previously opposed other Trump nominees.The confirmation passed with a narrow 51-49 vote, as all Senate Democrats voted against him.In his swearing-in remark, Patel spoke about the American Dream and how a first-general Indian kid has his American dream fulfilled.""Anyone who thinks the American Dream is dead, look right here. You're talking to a first-generation Indian kid who is about to lead the law enforcement community in the greatest nation on God's Earth,"" Patel said.""I know the media is in here.

I can't talk about that publicly, but, you know, President Trump has given a very strong directive, and that's going to be followed.""""Donald Trump doesn't make empty promises. I think promises made, promises kept, and that's why we're all there to carry out his directive about making America safe and prosperous,"" she added.During the run-up to the presidential elections, Bondi called for the release of names in the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein case files and said that those seeking to keep their identities hidden in Epstein's case have ""no legal basis"" to do so.Epstein, an American financier linked to numerous high-profile individuals, died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The extent of these individuals' involvement in the case remains unclear.Bondi expressed frustration over delays in releasing related documents and stressed the significant scope of human trafficking in the US .""These documents were so slow to come out. Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar business in this country. And Jeffrey Epstein is dead.

Many other underage girls later alleged similar abuse. However, in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge involving one victim and served 13 months in jail under a work-release program.Despite his conviction, Epstein continued to mingle with wealthy and influential figures, often through charitable endeavors, for another decade. The scandal resurfaced after a Miami Herald investigation, prompting federal prosecutors in New York to charge Epstein with sex trafficking in 2019.Following Epstein's death, his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was prosecuted for her role in recruiting underage victims. She was convicted in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.","US attorney general Pam Bondi assured that Trump administration will not let the 'predators' like Jeffery Epstein and P Diddy get a pass.

Giorgia Meloni: 'Left is nervous with Trump’s victory': Italian PM Meloni slams liberal 'double standard' in CPAC address,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/left-is-nervous-with-trumps-victory-italian-pm-meloni-slams-liberal-double-standard-in-cpac-address/articleshow/118493946.cms,"Italy's Meloni at CPAC

Italian Prime Minister GIORGIA MELONI'S Full Speech at CPAC 2025

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has claimed that the Left is panicking over US President Donald Trump ’s victory, accusing liberals of hypocrisy and global conservatives of being unfairly called a “threat to democracy.”Speaking via videolink at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington DC on Saturday, Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.The Italian PM argued that the Left’s frustration had turned into “hysteria” following Trump’s return to power, not only because conservatives were winning elections but because they were now working together internationally. “When Bill Clinton and Tony Blair created the global leftist liberal network in the 90s, they were called statesmen,” she said.“Today, when Trump, Maloni, Millay or maybe Modi talk, they are called a threat to democracy. This is the last double standard, but we are used to it, and the good news is people no longer believe in their lies, despite all the mud they throw at us. Citizens keep voting for us,"" she added.Meloni backed Trump as a strong leader, dismissing any suggestion that his presidency would create rifts within the conservative movement . “Our adversaries hope that President Trump will move away from us, but knowing him as a strong and effective leader I bet that those who hope for divisions will be proven wrong,” she said.Meloni also defended JD Vance, who faced criticism for his speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he said Europe’s greatest threat came “from within.” Meloni dismissed the backlash, claiming liberal elites were uncomfortable with conservatives speaking openly about identity and democracy. “Vice President Vance was discussing something deeper: identity, democracy, freedom of speech,” she said.Meloni’s participation in CPAC came amid calls from Italian opposition leaders to cancel her appearance. The controversy followed former Trump advisor Steve Bannon’s speech at the event, during which he appeared to make a Nazi-style salute. Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein condemned CPAC as a “neo-fascist gathering” and urged Meloni to disassociate from it. However, Meloni went ahead with her speech, aligning herself with the conservative movement and dismissing left-wing criticism.She reiterated her belief in a conservative vision of leadership and said that, “We serve the people, we do not rule over them.”","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.
