'People have learned to take disorder as order': VP Dhankar's jibe at MPs after Parliament ruckus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-have-learned-to-take-disorder-as-order-vp-dhankars-jibe-at-mps-after-parliament-ruckus/articleshow/116582931.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reiterating his disappointment over the chaotic Parliament session, vice president and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday warned lawmakers not to mistake 'disorder' for 'order.' His message comes against the backdrop of a winter session that has proven to be the most unproductive in more than a year.The session, held from November 25 to December 20, was marred by violence, protests, and a significant drop in productivity. It operated for roughly half its scheduled time, with the Lok Sabha functioning for 57% of its scheduled time and the Rajya Sabha for 43%.Calling for accountability, Dhankhar said, ""Make no mistake, I am referring to parliamentarians. People have learned to take disorder as order. There is no sense of revulsion.""""Hopefully, people will write and their thoughts will move. People will force you to think, 'Why did you go there (Parliament)?'"" the RS chair added.The dissatisfaction over the lack of productivity in both Houses was echoed on the last day of the session. Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar urged political parties to rise above political differences and restore the dignity of parliamentary discourse. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla skipped the customary valedictory speech, instead issuing a stern warning just before 'Vande Mataram' was played to mark the session's end.""It is improper to hold any protests or demonstrations at any of Parliament's gates. You must follow the rules in this regard. I urge you once again to take this warning seriously,"" LS Speaker Om Birla said on Friday.""The world watches our democracy, yet we fail our citizens through our conduct. These Parliamentary disruptions mock public trust and expectations. Our fundamental duty to serve with diligence lies neglected,"" the Rajya Sabha chairman said in his address to the House before it was adjourned on Friday.Referring to the unabated disruptions since the session began, Dhankhar lamented, ""Where reasoned dialogue should prevail, we witness only chaos."" The Vice President, against whom the opposition submitted a no-confidence motion, urged every parliamentarian from all parties to ""examine their conscience.""""The citizens of our democracy – one-sixth of humanity – deserve better than this spectacle. We squander precious opportunities that could serve the greater good of our people. I hope Members will introspect deeply, and citizens exercise their accountability. These hallowed chambers deserve conduct that honours our oath, not theatrics that betray it,"" he concluded.","Jagdeep Dhankhar urges political parties to rise above political differences and restore the dignity of parliamentary discourse.

But during cross-examination, she claimed to have moved out due to a ""helpless situation"".However, even after the wife moved out of the husband's Kolaghat house in 2008, her family and a friend kept staying there.

Police sources said they have requested detailed information regarding rules and regulations governing the transport of petroleum, oil, and gas products on roads from relevant companies. The SIT was constituted to investigate the cause of the accident.The accident occurred when an LPG tanker, carrying gas from Mundra Port in Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh via the Ajmer-Jaipur National Highway, attempted to make a U-turn in Bhankrota area. Shortly after, at 5.44am, a truck filled with blankets and bedsheets, approaching from the opposite direction, collided with the tanker while it was negotiating the turn.Officials said the driver of the tanker involved in the accident was identified. He had managed to escape the impact zone. ""We contacted the vehicle's owner on Friday and tried reaching him again on Saturday, but he was untraceable. SIT is now looking for whereabouts of the driver,"" the official said.""The nozzles and what appear to be safety valves could not withstand the pressure and broke. However, we have to check if the nozzles and valves broke because of the crash with the truck,"" officials said. ""Our primary assessment is that the tanker driver is the only person who escaped unscathed from the impact zone,"" the official said.Sources said while there have been prior incidents of LPG and CNG tankers overturning on highways, this is the first time that the city police have seen safety valves and nozzles come undone immediately after a crash. The SIT requested the tanker's fitness certificates and details of the LPG content at the time of the accident, among other things. ""We will also approach BPCL regarding their regulatory policies concerning transportation of LPG via roads,"" an official said.""Modern tanks are designed to withstand shocks encountered during transport, but for valves to break off is a cause of concern,"" an official remarked.","The special investigation team (SIT) of Rajasthan police is working to piece together events leading up to Friday's accident.

Why some are angry with Allu Arjun



Telangana CM vs Allu Arjun



NEW DELHI: Hyderabad police detained 6 people in custody who claimed to be affiliated with Osmania University Joint Action Committee (OUJAC), unlawfully entered Telugu actor Allu Arjun 's Jubilee Hills residence and vandalised flower pots and other things.Hyderabad DGP said that the case has been registered against the 6 persons and others who were involved in the said offences and stringent action as per law is being initiated against them all.""Today at around 4.45 pm, some persons holding placards in their hands suddenly rushed to the residence of actor Allu Arjun in Jubilee Hills and started sloganeering and one of them mounted the compound and started throwing tomatoes. When the security staff objected and persuaded them to get down from the wall, they got into an altercation. They climbed down the wall, manhandled the security staff and damaged some flower pots kept along the ramp,"" DCP West Zone, Hyderabad said.""On receiving the information, Jubilee Hills Police reached the place and took the 6 persons into custody. They all claim to be part of the Osmania University Joint Action Committee (OU-JAC). A case has been registered against the 6 persons and others who were involved in the said offences and stringent action as per law is being initiated against them all,"" DCP West Zone, Hyderabad added.The intruders climbed over the property's boundary wall and pelted tomatoes at the residence. They proceeded to enter the grounds and damaged ornamental plants whilst shouting slogans, creating a tense atmosphere.The protesters raised slogans against the actor and sought justice to the woman who died in a stampede at a movie theatre here earlier this month on the occasion of screening of the actor's latest film 'Pushpa-2'.Law enforcement officers subsequently arrived and detained the protesters.On December 4, the actor went to the Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre to attend the premiere of his movie Pushpa 2: The Rule.A massive crowd gathered to catch a glimpse of the star. The situation escalated when Arjun waved to fans from the sunroof of his vehicle, leading to the tragic death of a woman named Revathi in the ensuing chaos.Following the incident, Allu Arjun was arrested but released the next day after being granted bail by the Telangana High Court upon furnishing a Rs50,000 bond.On Saturday, chief minister A Revanth Reddy expressed criticism towards the actor for attending the theatre despite police withholding permission for the film's cast to visit the venue.In response to AIMIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi's query in the Assembly, Reddy highlighted concerns about Allu Arjun's interaction with large crowds, citing circulating videos as evidence.According to Reddy, the theatre management had requested security arrangements on December 2 for prominent actors' visits scheduled for December 4. The police declined the request, citing crowd management challenges and the venue's limited access points.Following Reddy's criticism, Allu Arjun promptly organised a press conference to deny the accusations, stating that police officers facilitated his arrival at the venue.The actor specifically contested claims about conducting a roadshow or engaging with crowds.""Had there not been permission, they would have told us to return and I am a law-abiding citizen. I would've followed that. Nothing of that sort of information was given to me. I was following as per their guidance and it was not a roadshow. There was no procession. It was just a crowd a few meters away from the theatre,"" he said, adding it was the police who were clearing the way for him and he reached the venue under their directions.The chief minister asserted that the actor greeted fans through his car's sunroof whilst entering and leaving the theatre, drawing thousands of enthusiastic supporters.Reddy noted that the actor's arrival attracted massive crowds due to multiple theatres in the vicinity.Reddy reported that the situation became precarious when the actor's security personnel pushed back fans, nearly causing a stampede.", Hyderabad police detained 6 people in custody who claimed to be affiliated with Osmania University Joint Action Committee (OUJAC) The intruders unlawfully entered Telugu actor Allu Arjun's Jubilee Hills residence and vandalised flower pots and other things.

This town is 360km from Bhopal and barely 20km from the Rajasthan border. It seems to have travelled 50-60km out of Kuno's protected perimeter and is around 70km from Ranthambore.The forest department is closely monitoring its movements. The cheetah is currently establishing its own territory outside Kuno National Park, said officials. They have opted not to tranquilize the animal, hoping it will return safely to Kuno.Residents of Sheopur were thrilled to catch a glimpse of the cheetah as it moved through the area. Locals excitedly shared videos on social media, celebrating this rare sighting outside the protected habitat.It seems to be following in the footsteps of cheetah Pawan aka Oban, the original ghumakkad, who kept wandering beyond Kuno's confines, keeping foresters on the tenterhooks. It was tranquillised in April 2023 to stop it from crossing over to Uttar Pradesh. This April, female cheetah Veera was rescued by foresters after going for a stroll in Jaura, Pahargarh, and Kailaras areas of Morena for 25 days.Rajasthan's forest officials have been alerted to the wandering cheetah's movements.

Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones while patrolling the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month.A Coast guard member, speaking anonymously, shared his disbelief, stating, “It’s the implication that’s insulting.”“It’s implying we’re making things up, when the ones making up things are down in Washington, DC.”The sailor’s comments came shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed temporary flight restrictions over parts of New Jersey and New York. He was among 12 crew members aboard the 47-foot rescue vessel that encountered the drones on the evening of the sighting.“We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings,” the sailor explained. “Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us.”According to the sailor, the drones appeared suddenly around 9 pm and followed the vessel for about 15 minutes. The drone swarm mirrored the boat’s movements, shifting direction as the boat did. “They had four propellers, about seven feet across, with festive red, green, and white flashing lights,” he said. The drones flew at an estimated 80 to 100 feet above the vessel.The swarm kept pace with the Department of Homeland Security boat, which was travelling at around 20 knots (just over 20 miles per hour). The drones eventually ascended, climbing an additional 100 feet before veering left towards the shoreline and disappearing from sight.The sailor is adamant that these were no ordinary commercial drones. “Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. We know what drones look and sound like,” he said.However, White House spokesman John Kirby downplayed the Coast Guard’s account, suggesting the drones could have been a mix of commercial, hobbyist, and law enforcement drones, as well as aircraft and even stars mistakenly identified as drones. Kirby stated that the sightings presented no national security or public safety threat, and suggested that the Coast Guard might have confused incoming airliners with drones.The Coast Guardsman disagreed, saying, “I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, but those weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones.”The sailor added, “I don’t care what Kirby or [DHS head Alejandro] Mayorkas say — they’re full of sh-t.” He stressed that while their orders were to observe and not engage with the drones, they would have taken defensive action if the drones had acted aggressively.Local officials, including Representatives Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have criticised the federal response, demanding a clear explanation for the mysterious drone activity, the New York Post quoted.Since November 18, more than 1,000 drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey, with dozens more in New York’s airspace, raising growing concerns over the presence of drones in civilian airspace. Federal authorities, however, maintain that the sightings pose no security threat.","Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones.

"Wisconsin Female Shooter: Wisconsin shooter Natalie Rupnow was a new student, joined less than 4 months ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-shooter-natalie-rupnow-was-a-new-student-joined-less-than-4-months-ago/articleshow/116544793.cms,"Natalie Rupnow was a new student at the school where she opened fire before shooting herself.



What are the newest revelations in the Wisconsin school shooting

Natalie Rupnow had two guns with her when she opened fire. She used a handgun to carry out the attack after which she shot herself. The other gun was not used in the attack. Natalie Rupnow's parents -- Jeff Rupnow and Melissa Rupnow -- may face criminal charges but the police did not comment on it. Investigators are looking at if the parents were negligent. Rupnow's parents have been married to each other and divorced from each other twice which resulted in a very chaotic custody battle with Natalie switching between her mother and father. Natalie was in therapy over her turbulent family life. Both her parents had other children from other partners. Natalie's gun attack lasted for just about eight minutes. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the motive appears to be a combination of factors. FBI detained Alexander Paffendorf, a 20-year-old man in California because he was in connection with Natalie Rupnow. Paffendorf admitted to discussing plans with Rupnow to arm himself with explosives and target a government building. A TikTok account believed to belong to Natalie Rupnow has been deleted after the shooting. The account posted a range of very generic white supremacist and antisemitic memes. ABC News reported that Rupnow also had an X account through which she shared footage of a 2015 stabbing at a school in Sweden and a video of a person killing themselves at a shooting range.

Natalie 'Samantha' Rupnow, the 15-year-old, who opened fire at the Abundant Life Christian School in Wisconsin killing a teacher and a student was new to the school and joined only four months ago indicating that she probably did not have any grudge against the school specifically. The alleged manifesto, however, spoke about her being picked on, bullied, and ignored in school which might also refer to other schools she attended.At this school, Rupnow was in her first semester. The school was working with her family on attendance, but teachers had no significant concerns, the school authorities said.","Natalie Rupnow had two guns with her when she opened fire.

The purpose behind the construction of Stonehenge, a monument dating back roughly 5,000 years, has long puzzled historians and archaeologists. However, a new study may have shed light on its origins, suggesting it served as a symbol of unity among the peoples of ancient Britain , according to the news outletResearchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University claim that Stonehenge was created to represent the unification of communities from different regions of Britain. They claim that people from Scotland and Wales contributed local stones to the construction as a gesture of goodwill.The study, published in, highlights Stonehenge as an early example of a political and symbolic effort to unify diverse communities. The researchers describe the monument as a ""monumental expression of unity between people, land, ancestors, and the heavens.""In the paper, the researchers argue that Stonehenge’s long-distance links support the theory that the Neolithic monument had a unifying purpose in ancient Britain, alongside its symbolic value.""The fact that all of its stones originated from distant regions, making it unique among over 900 stone circles in Britain, suggests that the stone circle may have had a political as well as a religious purpose,"" said lead author Professor Mike Parker Pearson from UCL's Institute of Archaeology.""[It was] a monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos.""The study posits that the Scottish and Welsh contributions symbolized alliances and shared efforts, embodying a sacred or political unity . Additionally, similarities in architectural styles between northern Scotland and the Stonehenge region suggest strong connections between these areas.""[This was] perhaps to cement an alliance or to take part in the extraordinary long-distance collaboration that building Stonehenge represented and embodied,"" the authors added.Evidence shows that many of the individuals buried at Stonehenge lived outside Salisbury Plain, indicating it was a site that drew people from across Britain.The study aligns with earlier research suggesting Stonehenge was used for rituals and ceremonies tied to the solstices. During the winter solstice, the setting sun aligns with the Altar Stone, further emphasizing its celestial significance.Theories about Stonehenge's purpose have ranged from its use as a solar calendar to a center for healing, ancestor worship, or burial rites. Despite ongoing debates, this new research strengthens the idea that Stonehenge was a profound symbol of unity and collaboration among ancient British communities.",A new study suggests Stonehenge was created to represent the unification of communities from different regions of Britain.

Similarly, Harris canceled her planned flight to California and stayed in the capital.

Social media abuzz with speculation

Budget crisis speculation

Earlier conversations with

Harris' recent public appearance

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris abruptly canceled their holiday plans on Friday, fueling speculation about an ongoing emergency at the White House , as per various reports. Neither has issued a public statement , leaving the nation guessing about the sudden changes.Biden, who was expected to spend Christmas in Delaware, reportedly returned to Washington, DC, taking his motorcade directly from the airport to the White House late in the evening. Similarly, Harris canceled her planned flight to California and stayed in the capital.Harris had planned to be in LA until Monday, but her office provided no reason for the last-minute cancellation, leaving many to wonder if the political turmoil over the government’s funding was the cause. As the deadline for a potential government shutdown looms on Friday, Harris' absence from the West Coast has fueled further uncertainty about the Biden administration’s strategy in handling the budget impasse.The abrupt schedule changes have sparked widespread speculation on social media. One user noted discrepancies in the president’s official schedule, saying, “The official schedule for Biden does say he was to return to the White House at 5:30 pm, but as you can see, it has recently been updated.”Another user posted, “Kamala Harris canceled her trip, rushing back to the White House…WHAT IS HAPPENING?” The lack of clarity has left many questioning whether the cancellations are tied toHurricane Helene briefings or another undisclosed matter.Meanwhile, some social media users circulated images of an alleged White House press release stating that the ""Vice President will not travel to Los Angeles, CA, and will remain in Washington, DC.""Republicans are embroiled in an internal battle over a budget deal brokered between Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democrats, aimed at averting a government shutdown. Critics have slammed the bill for being rushed through Congress, arguing that members were not given enough time to fully review the proposal.Meanwhile, the deal was further complicated when Republicans, led by President-elect Donald Trump and entrepreneur Elon Musk, introduced an alternate funding bill. That plan was swiftly rejected in the House, with many Republicans voting against it, creating a partisan standoff.Democrats, particularly those close to Harris, expressed frustration that the bipartisan agreement, which was seen as a potential compromise, was derailed after Musk publicly campaigned against it on X, the social media platform he owns. The showdown has added to the tension on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers race to find a resolution before the shutdown deadline.While Harris has not publicly commented on the situation, insiders close to her suggest that she is carefully weighing her political future, reported the Blaze. Following the aftermath of a challenging election, Harris has reportedly told allies that she intends to remain an influential figure in American politics.Some speculate that she may consider a campaign for governor of California, though others believe she will take on a more prominent role opposing the incoming Trump administration, reported the Blaze.“She is not someone who makes rash decisions,” said former Harris aide Brian Brokaw. “She takes, sometimes, a painfully long time to make decisions. So I would pretty much guarantee you she has no idea what her next move is.”With the deadline for a government shutdown fast approaching, all eyes will be on Harris and her next steps as the political drama continues to unfold in Washington.Before his return, Biden had a conversation with Pope Francis to discuss efforts to promote peace during the holiday season. According to a White House readout, the president thanked the pope for his advocacy on global issues and accepted an invitation to visit the Vatican next month.Harris’ last public event was on Tuesday, where she addressed high school and college students in Largo, Maryland. During her speech, she urged supporters to remain committed to their values despite the challenges ahead. “Yes, there is disappointment, but there is also resolve for the future. We must stay in the fight,” Harris said, referencing the aftermath of her election loss to Donald Trump.","Biden reportedly returned to Washington, DC, taking his motorcade directly from the airport to the White House late in the evening.

Videos of the Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian city of Kazan, showing strikes on several residential high-rise buildings, went viral on social media and Telegram channels on Saturday.Russian state media confirmed the attack, reporting eight drone impacts, with six hitting residential buildings in Kazan, located about 800 kilometers east of Moscow.Local officials reported no injuries or fatalities from the incident, which prompted emergency services to respond and evacuate residents.Russia's aviation watchdog, Rosaviatsia, announced via Telegram that Kazan airport had temporarily suspended all flight arrivals and departures.The Kazan airport in Russia temperarirly suspended all incoming and outgoing flights on Saturday, as announced by Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation authority, through Telegram, following a Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle strike on the city.The Baza Telegram channel, known for its connections to Russian security organisations has also shared an unconfirmed video content depicting an aerial device striking a tall building, resulting in a significant explosion.Rosaviatsia additionally implemented temporary flight limitations at Izhevsk airport, located in a smaller urban centre northeast of Kazan.Earlier on Friday Russia and Ukraine traded accusations over deadly missile strikes. Moscow reported that a missile attack on its Kursk border region killed five people, while an earlier strike on Kyiv left one man dead.According to news agency Reuters, Governor Alexander Khinshtein said that Ukraine targeted Rylsk, a small town in Russia's Kursk region, resulting in five deaths and twelve injuries.Khinshtein stated that Kyiv employed US-provided HIMARS rocket systems to strike civilian facilities, including a school and a pilot training college dormitory.Last year, Russia accused Ukraine of using cluster munitions to attack a town of approximately 15,000 residents located about 20 miles (30 km) from the border.Ukrainian military officials reported successfully intercepting and destroying 57 Russian drones during a nighttime assault. Additionally, they confirmed that 56 other Russian drones failed to strike their intended destinations.Ukraine's air force also reported that Russia launched five Iskander missiles at Kyiv, all of which were successfully intercepted. However, falling debris caused damage in several districts.Although Russian aerial attacks frequently target the capital, significant damage is rare due to Kyiv’s robust air defense system, nearly three years into Russia's invasion.The Ukrainian foreign ministry confirmed damage to a building housing multiple embassies, including those of Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal, Montenegro, and Albania's diplomatic mission.Earlier during a press conference on Thursday, Putin proposed testing his assertion about Russia's new Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile's defence-penetrating capabilities over Kyiv.""Let them set some target to be hit, let's say in Kyiv,"" he said, Reuters reported.""They will concentrate there all their air defences.

2011 cleric murder

KOLKATA: A Pakistan-trained member of banned terrorist group Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TuM), wanted by Jammu & Kashmir Police for the 2011 murder of a cleric in J&K, was arrested late Saturday by the Bengal special task force (STF) from Canning in South 24 Parganas, 60km from Kolkata.IED expert Jawed Munshi was acting under Lashkar-e-Taiba's (LeT) instructions, police said. He was apprehended in a joint raid by STF and J&K cops on a building called Gulshan House, near Canning Sub-Divisional Hospital. Munshi reached Canning two days ago, posing as a shawl seller. He planned to escape to Bangladesh, the cops said.A court in Kolkata’s Alipore allowed the J&K police team to take Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TuM) member Jawed Munshi — who was caught late Saturday from Canning — on transit remand to Jammu & Kashmir, where he is to be charged under UAPA , by Dec 31.Munshi has been handed over to the J&K cops, said Indrajit Basu, SP (operations), Bengal STF .“Munshi, a known IED expert and weapons handler, is affiliated with the banned terrorist organisation Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TuM),” according to a statement released by the Bengal police , which adds, “Munshi has a history of involvement in terror-related activities, including alleged participation in the 2011 murder of Showkat Ahmad Shah, a leader of the Ahl-i-Hadith, and has served multiple jail terms under terrorism-related charges.”Shah, an Islamic cleric, was murdered in 2011 by an IED fitted in a bicycle. Eight people were accused of the murder. In Feb 2020, during the trial, Abdul Gani Dar alias Abdullah Gazali, a former TuM chief then out on bail, was found murdered near the same mosque, where Shah had been killed. Six others who faced trial were acquitted by a special NIA court in Dec 2020 for lack of evidence. Munshi was on the run and was being tracked by agencies.Bengal police said that Munshi, after preliminary interrogation, had “admitted to” multiple visits to Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan on instructions of his handlers, using fake Pakistani passports. The cops also confirmed that Munshi had been acting under instructions of LeT.Mushi’s arrest follows the recent arrests of eight suspected members of terrorist outfit Ansar-al-Islam Bangladesh. Two of the eight arrested were from Murshidabad.Gulshan House, from where Jawed was held, is temporary home to Tabassum Biwi and her husband Golam Mohammad, both from J&K, who take this place on rent between Nov and Feb each year to sell Kashmiri shawls. Tabassum told TOI that Jawed was her brother-in-law, who got married to her sister 25 years ago. “He wanted to visit us, so we agreed. I have no idea what he does,” she said, adding that he was arrested the day he arrived at their home.Munabbar Piyada, the owner of Gulshan House, could not be reached for comment.","IED expert Jawed Munshi was acting under Lashkar-e-Taiba's (LeT) instructions, police said.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul faced intense criticism after touting the safety of the city's subway system in a social media post, just hours after a horrific incident where a woman was set on fire and burned to death aboard a train.Hochul, who has been vocal about her efforts to improve subway safety, shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that crime in the city’s subway system had decreased following her deployment of National Guard troops in March. The governor highlighted the addition of security cameras on subway cars and the presence of 750 National Guard members stationed in the subway system since the beginning of the year as part of efforts to curb crime.""In March, I took action to make our subways safer for the millions of people who take the trains each day,"" Hochul wrote. ""Since deploying the @NationalGuardNY to support @NYPDnews and @MTA safety efforts and adding cameras to all subway cars, crime is going down, and ridership is going up.""However, the timing of the tweet raised eyebrows, as it came just hours after a brutal attack on the F train at the Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn, where a woman was set on fire by a man identified as 33-year-old Sebastian Zapeta.Hochul's post was even hit by a community note on X that spoke for the victim whose life ended tragically in the allegedly intentional attack.Police sources stated that the victim, a woman believed to have been sleeping at the time, was engulfed in flames after Zapeta threw a lit match on her. The woman, whose identity has not been confirmed, was later pronounced dead at the scene.The viral spread of a video showing the incident left many shocked, with several social media users quick to point out the stark contrast between Hochul's tweet and the brutal reality of subway violence.Some even responded to her post with graphic footage of the attack, highlighting the lack of sensitivity in her messaging. The tweet was briefly flagged with a community note on X, referencing the tragic incident.Former Governor Andrew Cuomo's secretary, Melissa DeRosa, joined the growing chorus of critics, condemning Hochul for her tone-deaf response. ""2 people were murdered in the subway today,"" DeRosa wrote. ""The governor of the state of NY is a tourist who can’t even bother to read a newspaper while she’s in town.""The backlash didn’t stop there. The advocacy group AntiSemitism also weighed in, suggesting that Hochul’s communications team needed a revamp. “She needs a new social media team,” they wrote in response to the tweet.Lori Mills, the vice chair of the Ventura County Republican Party, was also blunt in her reply, saying, ""You must have missed today’s news.""Meanwhile, sources have identified the suspect in the attack as Sebastian Zapeta, a 33-year-old man who allegedly entered the US from Guatemala about a year ago. The details of his immigration status remain unclear, and authorities have yet to confirm whether he entered the country legally. Fox News Digital has reached out to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for more information regarding Zapeta's status.The incident, which adds to the growing concerns over subway safety, has reignited debates on how effective the current measures are and whether Hochul’s strategies are truly addressing the city’s violent crime problem.","New York Governor Kathy Hochul faced intense criticism after touting the safety of the city's subway system in a social media post.

How the deadly Christmas market attack in Germany ?

Suspect appear in court in deadly Christmas market attack

A car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on Friday killed five people and injured over 200. The German government promised a full investigation into potential security failures.Suspect Taleb al-Abdulmohsen , a 50-year-old Saudi psychiatrist, drove a car into the crowded market. Authorities are examining prior online death threats and his past legal troubles.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and intelligence officials will testify before a parliamentary committee on December 30.Faeser said the investigation will leave “no stone unturned” in determining what security services knew before the attack. She noted the attacker's unusual profile, saying he acted “like a terrorist although ideologically he was clearly an enemy of Islam”.Abdulmohsen previously identified as a “Saudi atheist” and criticized Germany's refugee policies online. He also expressed support for far-right theories about “Islamisation” of Europe.A car plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on Friday evening, killing five people and injuring 200. The dead include four women aged 45, 52, 67, and 75, and a 9-year-old boy named Andre Gleissner. Forty-one of the injured are in serious condition.A 50-year-old Saudi doctor living in Germany is in custody, suspected of murder, attempted murder, and bodily harm. A judge ordered him held pending a possible indictment. Media identified him as Taleb A., a psychiatry and psychotherapy specialist residing in Germany since 2006. His online presence reveals anti-Islam sentiments and criticism of German authorities. “straightforward labels like 'Islamist terrorism' or 'extreme right-wing' don't fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see,” observed Ken McCallum, head of Britain's MI5. Prosecutors suggest a possible motive is ""dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi refugees in Germany.""German authorities are facing criticism for security lapses. The Federal Criminal Police Office received an unspecific warning from Saudi Arabia in November 2023 about the suspect. He was known for numerous online posts, contact with authorities, and making threats but was not considered violent. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also received a warning about him last year.The attack prompted some German towns to cancel Christmas markets. Berlin increased police presence at its markets. Chancellor Olaf Scholz faced criticism during a visit to Magdeburg on Saturday. This attack follows other extremist incidents in Germany, including a knife attack in Solingen in August and a 2016 truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market. The market in Magdeburg reopened on Sunday, with residents paying respects at a makeshift memorial.A suspect in the deadly Christmas market attack is in custody after a judge’s order on Saturday. German authorities are facing criticism for their possible role in the attack's prevention. The suspect appeared in court late Saturday night. The court ordered the suspect held pending trial. More details about the attack and the suspect have yet to be released.","A car plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on Friday evening, killing five people and injuring 200.

A bridge connecting two Brazilian states collapsed Sunday, killing at least one person and causing a sulfuric acid spill. The incident occurred on the BR-226 highway between Estreito, Maranhão, and Aguiarnópolis, Tocantins.As per Reuters report, it was the central section of the 533-meter Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira Bridge that gave way as vehicles crossed.A city councilman from Aguiarnópolis, Elias Junior, was filming a video highlighting safety concerns about the bridge when it suddenly gave way. During his recording, Junior was appealing to authorities to address the structural issues of the bridge, emphasising its inability to support heavy lorry traffic. As he was demonstrating a significant crack along the bridge's shoulder, the whole structure started to crumble forcing him to retreat hastily.As a result of the collapse, a tanker truck carrying sulfuric acid fell into the Tocantins River, according to the National Department of Transport Infrastructure.Rescue workers confirmed one death and rescued one survivor. Preliminary reports quoted by Reuters indicate two trucks, a car, and a motorcycle also plunged into the river, which is over 50 meters deep, potentially involving 11 people.Divers suspended their search Sunday evening after discovering a submerged tanker leaking sulfuric acid, the Tocantins fire department reported.The bridge, opened in 1960, is a reinforced concrete structure. It forms part of the BR-226 highway linking Brasília to Belém, the planned host city for next year's UN Climate Change Conference.","A bridge connecting two Brazilian states collapsed Sunday, killing at least one person and causing a sulfuric acid spill.

His second term doesn’t start for a month, but Donald Trump is already sending shockwaves around the world.His trade threats helped set off a cabinet crisis in Canada that has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau teetering. In Europe, tariff fears have weakened already-wobbling governments.Allied leaders are racing to find ways to keep up support for Ukraine as Trump drives for a quick deal to end Russia’s invasion. The prospect of talks has both sides pushing on the battlefield, with Moscow using its most sophisticated missiles and Kyiv taking the fight to the Russian capital with the brazen assassination of a general.In the Middle East, the Trump-friendly leaders of Israel and Turkey are pressing for advantage as Iran, a perennial target of the incoming president, reels from setbacks for its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas and the abrupt fall of the dictator it backed in Syria.China, which has largely avoided Trump’s post-election social media spotlight so far, is shoring up its trade defenses ahead of what’s expected to be an onslaught from the new administration.“We’re on Trump time and we want to get stuff done in a hurry,” Keith Kellogg, the retired general Trump has named as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Fox Business on Dec. 18 as he prepared for his first trip to the region - even before the inauguration. “He made promises on the campaign trail and we’re going to fulfill those promises.”While it’s not unusual for political leaders at home and abroad to jockey for the ear of an incoming president, the scale of Trump’s pre-inauguration influence is vast.“There’s new light all over the world, not just here,” Trump claimed in a Phoenix speech Sunday.That came after he’d warned Panama that the US objects to rates to use the Panama Canal and is concerned about growing Chinese influence over the conduit — going so far as to say he might demand its return to American control.Domestically, he spent the last week steering talks on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers are beginning to factor in some of the president-elect’s potential moves, such as tariffs. The US stock market and bitcoin have rallied since the election, something Trump likes to take credit for. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has all but vanished from the stage.For the world, the turmoil is a taste of what the new Trump term is likely to bring, as the incoming president pushes his “America First” agenda without many of the guardrails that constrained his first term. Populist forces are on the rise in many countries, with Trump allies challenging establishment leaders.Fresh from a tweet storm that influenced the spending-bill talks in Washington, billionaire Trump confidant Elon Musk Friday turned his attention to Europe, endorsing the far-right AfD party as the only way to “save Germany.”That earned him a rebuke from embattled Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who faces snap elections in February with support for his party dropping amid deepening economic woes. Musk stepped up the pressure Saturday, calling on Scholz to resign after a deadly attack on a Christmas market.In the UK, Trump’s ascent has emboldened Nigel Farage of the populist Reform UK party, who met with Musk at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate last week. UK lawmakers are weighing changing donation rules to prevent Musk from barging in.The stakes are possibly highest for Ukraine, where Russia’s full-scale invasion is nearly three years old and allied support for Kyiv is showing signs of flagging.Trump isn’t promising to deliver a deal to end the fighting even before he takes office as he did on the campaign trail, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already given up his earlier demand that Russia cede all the land it’s taken as part of any ceasefire deal.Germany’s Scholz held his first direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in two years last month, drawing fierce criticism from Zelenskyy. Until now, it’s largely been Hungary’s Viktor Orban — a Putin sympathizer whom Trump is fond of - seeking to act as an intermediary.On Sunday, Trump himself left the door open to meeting the Kremlin leader, who he claimed “wants to meet me as soon as possible.”Scholz said this month he’s “confident that we can develop a joint strategy for Ukraine.” He has continued to decline to provide Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles, breaking from Biden’s policy — one Trump thinks is a mistake.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with Trump by phone and picked Peter Mandelson, a Labor Party veteran and trade specialist, as envoy to Washington. That choice drew criticism from Trump’s former campaign co-manager, Chris LaCivita, who called Mandelson “an absolute moron.”Trump’s impending arrival has also buoyed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has aligned himself with Trump, who faces fewer political pressures than Biden over the death toll from fighting in Gaza.Netanyahu also sent troops further into Syria after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Turkey, whose leader is another Trump ally, is expanding its reach Syria through groups it supports.“All of these leaders in the Middle East, they know the former president, now the president-elect, they know his team, so it’s kind of a unique moment in history where you have two presidents, and their teams, working on the ceasefire at the same time,” Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman during Trump’s first term, said on Bloomberg Television’s Balance of Power, referring to talks on a deal in Gaza.In India, Trump’s arrival has coincided with an emboldened Narendra Modi preparing to host Putin for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. Modi is one of the world leaders Trump has cultivated through praise and shows of friendship.China has embarked on something of a charm offensive, including with US allies, ahead of Trump’s return — while also preparing tools for a potential trade war in the form of limits on exports of critical minerals to the US and by signaling a warming with both Japan and India.“In 2016, there was this constant sense of uncertainty, of alarm,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Now there’s a fairly robust data set of how Trump behaved and how other countries behaved in reaction to him, and what worked well and what didn’t.”But leaders are already learning that the carefully crafted strategies for dealing with the incoming president don’t always play out as planned.After Trump threatened to slap a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, Trudeau hopped on a plane to Trump’s Florida estate to talk the issue over at dinner. Then he offered a border-security plan to assuage Trump’s concern (even though Canadian officials say migrant flows across the frontier are tiny).Trump’s camp touted that as an early victory. “President Trump is already acting as the president,” Karoline Leavitt, his incoming press secretary, told Fox Business on Sunday.For his part, Trump offered no concessions and has spent the weeks since the dinner trolling Trudeau, suggesting Canada should become the 51st US state and complaining about the trade imbalance between the countries.Now, Trudeau’s government is at risk after his top lieutenant quit, citing in her resignation letter a disagreement over spending and how to prepare for a potential Trump trade war.","Donald Trump is already sending shockwaves around the world.

A calm yet chilling attack

A swift arrest

Elon Musk’s fiery response

A shaken city

A city on edge

The New York City subway witnessed one of its most horrifying incidents on Sunday morning when a sleeping passenger was set on fire aboard an F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station . The attack, which NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch described as “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit,” left the victim dead and stunned commuters and authorities alike.At 7:30 am, as the F train idled at the station, a man approached the victim—a woman seated quietly at the end of the subway car. Without hesitation, he used a lighter to ignite her clothing, as reported by the New York Post. “The suspect calmly walked up to the victim … and used what we believe to be a lighter to ignite the victim’s clothing, which became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,” Tisch explained during a press conference.Patrolling officers, drawn by the smell and sight of smoke, found the woman engulfed in flames. Though they quickly extinguished the fire, she succumbed to her injuries at the scene. Chilling video footage showed the suspect watching the horrifying spectacle unfold, his demeanor disturbingly detached.The suspect fled the scene but was soon apprehended, thanks to quick-thinking officers and observant citizens, reported the Post. He was found riding another train, still wearing the same gray hoodie and paint-splattered pants from the attack. Tisch credited the public for their role in the arrest, saying, “I want to thank the young people who called 911 to help. They saw something, and they said something, and they did something.”The man, identified as a migrant from Guatemala, had previously entered the US in 2018 through Arizona. Authorities are still determining his immigration status. Police confirmed that he did not know the victim and had no prior criminal record in New York City.The brutal attack even caught the attention of Tesla and X owner Elon Musk, who took to his platform to express outrage. Responding to a post on X that read, “The man who set an innocent woman on fire on the New York Subway, Sebastian Zapeta, is a recent ‘MIGRANT’ from Guatemala. The Biden regime REFUSED to deport him, and an innocent woman lost her life as a result. MASS DEPORTATIONS NOW!” Musk commented, “Enough is enough.”The tech billionaire’s statement has added fuel to an already heated debate about immigration policies and crime rates, with critics and supporters engaging in fiery exchanges online.The crime scene became a somber spectacle for commuters and MTA workers. Around 1 pm, the woman’s charred body was removed from the train, leaving witnesses in shock. “It just looked like all the clothes were burnt off,” one MTA worker recounted. Another commuter, Alex Gureyev, lamented, “It’s scary … Everybody keeps saying it’s going back to the seventies. It’s a frequent occurrence—muggings, killings, fighting, shootings. Very bad.”The attack has reignited concerns about subway safety. Governor Kathy Hochul had recently deployed 1,000 National Guard troops to patrol the subway system during the holiday rush, but crime continues to surge. Subway murders have risen by 60% this year, with eight people killed as of September, compared to five during the same period last year.The heinous attack capped off a violent 24-hour period on the subway. Earlier that day, separate incidents included a deadly stabbing during an argument on a Queens-bound 7 train and an assault on a conductor on a northbound D train.","A sleeping passenger was set on fire aboard an F train at the Coney Island- Stillwell Avenue station.

Panama Canal and foreign policy

Praise for Elon Musk

and TikTok

Closing rhetoric

President-elect Donald Trump, during his fiery speech at the AmericaFest in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday, took a direct swipe at ""woke culture,"" calling it ""bullshit"" and blaming it for undermining America’s strength. The 78-year-old’s comments sparked widespread reactions on social media, including an endorsement from Elon Musk, who tweeted “YES!” alongside a viral clip of Trump’s remarks.“Woke has to stop. It’s destroying our country. Woke is bullshit,” Trump declared, referencing the renaming of US military bases that previously honored Confederate leaders. He pledged to reverse such changes, including restoring the original name of Fort Bragg in North Carolina, now called Fort Liberty.Trump also vowed to end critical race theory and “transgender insanity” in schools, promising a hardline approach to culture war issues as part of his post-inauguration agenda.“I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military, and out of our elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools,” Trump said, signaling his administration's hardline stance.Trump also promised to “keep men out of women’s sports,” emphasizing that “it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.”The president-elect’s remarks come amid a growing political divide in the US over transgender rights , with states moving in opposite directions on issues such as medical treatments for minors and access to LGBTQ-themed books in public and school libraries. Republican-controlled states have sought to restrict access, while Democratic states have moved to safeguard transgender rights.In his first rally-like speech since the November election, he also threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, pushed back on criticism of Elon Musk’s influence, and suggested he could soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump outlined his plans for his first day in office, which he referred to as ""liberation day."" He vowed to crack down on illegal immigration, expand domestic energy production, and eliminate ""woke ideology"" from public institutions.In a broader policy statement, Trump criticized the renaming of Mount McKinley to Denali during the Obama administration. He promised to restore the mountain’s original name, saying, “McKinley was a very good, maybe a great president. He deserves that honor.”The former president surprised many by suggesting he might seek to reclaim control of the Panama Canal, calling it a “vital national asset.” He criticized Panama’s handling of the canal and demanded it be returned to the US, warning Panamanian officials to “be guided accordingly.” Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino swiftly rebuffed the comments, asserting the canal’s sovereignty and emphasizing cooperation on mutual security issues.Trump also floated the possibility of an early meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. “Bringing the war to an end is one of the things I want to do quickly,” he said, noting that Putin had expressed readiness for talks.Responding to claims that Elon Musk was acting as a “shadow president,” Trump dismissed the idea but praised Musk’s contributions to technology and space exploration. “No, he’s not going to be president. He wasn’t born in this country,” Trump quipped, adding, “I like having smart people.”Trump defended his controversial choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary, hinting at possible investigations into vaccines and their links to autism despite a lack of scientific evidence. “We’re going to find out a lot,” Trump said, emphasizing his goal to “make America healthy again.”On TikTok, Trump expressed openness to allowing the app to continue operating in the US, citing its role in reaching young voters during the 2024 election. “Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,” he said.Trump concluded by reiterating his commitment to fulfilling his campaign promises and tackling culture wars head-on. “We’re going to stop woke,” he declared, signaling a combative presidency ahead.","President-elect Donald Trump took a direct swipe at ""woke culture,"" calling it ""bullshit"" and blaming it for undermining America's strength.

The announcement, made on Trump’s social media platform, follows reports that the offer was extended to Feinberg earlier in December.Feinberg serves as co-CEO of Cerberus Capital Management , an investment firm with interests in hypersonic missile development and a former owner of the private military contractor DynCorp , which was acquired by Amentum in 2020.During Trump’s first term, Feinberg chaired the president’s Intelligence Advisory Board , which advises the president on intelligence and counterintelligence matters. Trump praised Feinberg as “an extremely successful businessman” who would contribute to “Making the Pentagon Great Again.”The role of deputy defence secretary involves overseeing the daily operations of the defence department, a vast organization comprising over three million military and civilian personnel. The appointment carries heightened significance amid debates over Trump’s nominee for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth , a former Fox News contributor who has faced controversy.Hegseth’s past includes an allegation of sexual assault in 2017 by a woman who claimed he raped her at a California Republican women’s event. While no charges were filed after a police and prosecutor review, Hegseth’s attorney stated the encounter was consensual and described the woman as the initiator, adding that Hegseth had been “visibly intoxicated” at the time.Trump also nominated additional defence-related appointments on Sunday. He nominated Elbridge A. Colby , a former deputy assistant secretary of defence known for his hawkish stance on China and advocacy for defending Taiwan in potential conflicts, as undersecretary for policy. Keith Bass, a retired Navy officer who previously led the White House Medical Unit under both the Obama and Trump administrations, was named as the pick for assistant secretary of defence for health affairs.","Stephen Feinberg is co-CEO of Cerberus Capital Management and a former owner of private military contractor DynCorp.

In a significant move to shape his incoming administration, President-elect Donald Trump has named Katie Miller to an advisory board tasked with slashing government regulations and trimming federal agencies. But who is Katie Miller, and why has she emerged as a key figure in this effort?Miller, a veteran of Trump’s first administration, served as deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and later as press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence. She is also the wife of Stephen Miller , Trump's incoming deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser.

Musk has already outlined ambitious plans to shrink the number of federal agencies from over 400 to just 99. The initiative aims to ""slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,"" Trump said in earlier remarks.While Miller is one of the first named members, Musk and Ramaswamy have yet to unveil the full team.

Musk's growing influence in Washington

A controversial agenda

Concluding with familiar flourish

At AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, President-elect Donald Trump addressed swirling rumors about ceding his presidency to tech billionaire Elon Musk . Speaking to a lively crowd, Trump dismissed the claims with his trademark candor, joking, “I’m safe, you know why? He wasn’t born in this country.” The remark, referencing Musk’s South African origins, drew laughter and applause from the audience.Rumors had gained traction in some media outlets, but Trump dismissed them outright. “They’re on a new kick,” he said. “All the different hoaxes. The new one is that President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk. No, no, that’s not happening,” Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying.Despite the speculation, Trump praised Musk, a significant donor to his campaign, for his intelligence and contributions. “Isn’t it nice to have smart people we can rely on? Don’t we want that? But no, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” Trump reiterated.Musk, whose companies heavily interact with federal regulations and contracts, has become a polarizing figure in US policymaking. His influence was evident last week when the Republican-controlled House passed legislation, avoiding a government shutdown, a move attributed partly to Musk’s efforts.Trump recently appointed Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly formed Department ofGovernment Efficiency , a temporary agency headquartered at SpaceX's Washington office.In his first rally-style appearance since winning the 2024 election, Trump unveiled a sweeping agenda. Promising to rebuild urban centers , cut taxes, and increase wages, he declared January 20 as “liberation day.”On cultural issues, Trump called for a “commonsense revolution” and condemned progressive policies. “Woke needs to come to an end. It’s ruining our nation,” he said, vowing to remove critical race theory and transgender policies from schools and military settings.Trump also pledged to address “transgender madness” on his first day in office, promising executive orders to ban transgender Americans from military service and women’s sports. “With the stroke of my pen, on day one, I will stop the transgender lunacy,” he declared.Trump ended the rally with his signature phrase, “Together we will fight, fight, fight, and together we will win, win, win!” The event concluded with Trump dancing to the Village People’s “YMCA,” a hallmark of his campaign appearances, as supporters cheered.","President-elect Donald Trump addressed swirling rumors about ceding his presidency to tech billionaire Elon Musk.

He claimed that the Panamanian authorities “haven’t treated us fairly” in their operation of the Panama Canal and criticised the fees for using the waterway as “ridiculous.”He also stated that if the principles behind the 1970s treaty, which granted Panama full control of the canal, were not followed, “then we will demand” that it be returned to the United States “in full, quickly and without question.” The canal is a key route for thousands of ships every year, making it critical for US and international trade.Trump, who regularly blames migrants from Latin America for America’s drug problems, reiterated his vow to immediately launch “the largest deportation operation in American history” upon taking office. He went further, stating he would “immediately designate the (drug) cartels as foreign terrorist organisations,” and promised that “this criminal network operating on American soil will be dismantled, deported, and destroyed.”During his first term in 2019, after the killing of nine American citizens from a Mormon community in Mexico, Trump had vowed to apply the terrorist designation to Mexican cartels. However, he later relented following a plea from then-Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.","Donald Trump pledges to'stop the transgender lunacy' from day one of his presidency.

"At least 3,100 Native Americans died in US boarding schools, higher than govt figures: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-3100-native-americans-died-in-us-boarding-schools-higher-than-govt-figures-report/articleshow/116576966.cms,"The actual death toll of native American children in US boarding schools is at least three times higher than the government’s official count, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.From 1819 to the 1970s, hundreds of Indian boarding schools were established across the US with the aim of forcibly assimilating native children into European settler culture. This included the forced conversion of children to Christianity.The investigation found that between 1828 and 1970, 3,104 indigenous students died at these schools, which is thrice the number reported by a recent government assessment. The schools, described by experts as having conditions similar to “prison camps,” were sites of high mortality, with children dying from disease, malnutrition, accidents, and sometimes under mysterious circumstances.Many of the children who died were buried in cemeteries near the schools, often far from their families and tribes. The bodies of these children were rarely returned home. As time passed, poor record-keeping has made it difficult to pinpoint the full extent of the deaths, with some gravesites either hidden, neglected, or paved over. The Post’s conclusions were drawn from “hundreds of thousands” of government documents.President Joe Biden sparked widespread attention in October when he issued a historic apology for what he called one of the nation’s ""most horrific chapters"": the forced removal of Native American children from their homes and their placement in these often abusive institutions. His apology followed a government report that documented the deaths of nearly 1,000 children, though the actual number was believed to be much higher.The Biden administration has since committed to significant support for Native American communities, investing in tribal autonomy, protecting sacred ancestral lands, and tackling gender-based violence. However, Native Americans remain among the poorest groups in the US, a direct result of centuries of marginalisation.In Canada, where more than 4,000 children are thought to have died or disappeared from similar residential schools, a government commission condemned the institutions as ""cultural genocide.""","Washington Post investigation finds 3,104 indigenous students died at boarding schools between 1828 and 1970.

'It’s scary': Woman burned alive while sleeping in subway train in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-scary-woman-burned-alive-while-sleeping-in-subway-train-in-us/articleshow/116575933.cms,"Violent Weekend in NYC Transit

Queens Stabbing: Just after midnight on Sunday, a fight among five men on a southbound 7 train at Woodside Avenue and 61st Street turned deadly. A 69-year-old man allegedly stabbed one person in the chest and another in the face. The victim stabbed in the chest died at the hospital. The suspect is in custody and awaiting charges.

Assault on D Train: At 4:30 am, a passenger threw a can at the conductor of a northbound D train, forcing it out of service. The 38-year-old conductor was hospitalized in stable condition. The attacker remains at large.

In a horrifying turn of events a woman was burned to death aboard an F train in Coney Island, New York, on Sunday morning after a man allegedly threw a lit match at her, causing her to catch fire, according to police sources.NYPD officers responded to reports of a fire at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station shortly before 7:30 am and found the woman engulfed in flames on an idling train. Emergency services declared her dead at the scene.Alex Gureyev, 39 year old Brooklyn construction manager said, “It’s scary.”Sources said the victim was surrounded by liquor bottles, though it is uncertain if they played a role in the fire. The woman appeared to have been sleeping when a man in his 20s, seated across from her, approached and threw the match. The suspect fled the station and the motive behind the attack remains unclear.In a video that has captured the incident, the man accused of setting the passenger on fire can be seen calmly on a bench, watching as she burned to death. Disturbing footage obtained by The Post shows the suspect nonchalantly observing the flames engulf the woman, who was standing by the door of the subway car as the train idled.A transit officer walks by the open door and appears to briefly speak into his radio as he continues down the platform. After the officer passes, the suspect, described as a 25- to 30-year-old man, approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighing around 150 pounds, stands up, seemingly to leave. The video then cuts off.The suspect was last seen wearing a grey hoodie, jeans, brown boots, and a dark knit hat with a red band, according to the NYPD. Authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for any information that could lead to his arrest.The incident had shocked commuters as the woman’s body was carried out of the station inside a black body bag just after 1 pm, as per the New York Post.“It’s incredible,” a commuter said.An MTA worker described the scene to The Post, saying the woman's clothes appeared to have been completely ""burned off.""“I was just walking by. The cops was there already. I didn’t see her in flames but that’s what I heard. It was out. They shut the lights off [in the car] so nobody could see,” the worker said.Commuters continuously paused in their tracks while transferring trains to take in the horrific scene.Gureyev said, “It’s going down hill a bit. Everybody keeps saying it’s going back to the seventies. It’s a frequent occurrence — not like this, setting people on fire — but like the mugging, the killings, the fighting, the shootings, they’re really common nowadays. [It’s] very bad.”The incident comes as New York Governor Kathy Hochul has increased National Guard patrols in the city’s subway system for the holiday season. The deployment brings the total number of guards to 1,000 as part of a $100 million security initiative. While Governor Hochul claimed a 10 per cent drop in transit crime since March, the murder rate in the subway system has risen by at least 60 per cent this year.These incidents underscore ongoing safety concerns in New York City’s subway system, even as millions of holiday visitors descend upon the city.","A woman was burned to death aboard an F train in Coney Island, New York, on Sunday morning after a man allegedly threw a lit match at her.

Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

It added that the claims were ""unfounded"" and warned that such allegations could damage the positive relationship that has existed between Pakistan and the US since 1954.The foreign office stressed that Pakistan has ""never had any ill-intention towards the US"" and that this reality remains unchanged. It further pointed out that Pakistan has made significant sacrifices for this relationship and continues to suffer the consequences of US policies in the region.It also expressed regret that the US official had seemingly equated Pakistan with adversarial nations, and addressed concerns over Pakistan’s missile capabilities, which it said were being raised ""at the behest of others"" to destabilise the already fragile strategic balance in the region. In a veiled reference to India’s missile programme, the statement highlighted the discrepancy in US concerns over Pakistan’s capabilities, which are intended solely for the defence of the country’s sovereignty and regional peace.The office reaffirmed Pakistan's right to develop its strategic capabilities to maintain credible minimum deterrence and respond to evolving threats. ""Pakistan will not tolerate any intrusion into its missile programme,"" the statement said, stressing that there is strong national consensus on this issue.Despite these concerns, Pakistan reiterated its willingness to engage constructively with the US on all matters, including security and regional stability, building on the longstanding history of cooperation between the two nations.","US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer accused Pakistan of developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities.

Pakistan military jails 25 Imran Khan supporters over May 9 violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-military-jails-25-imran-khan-supporters-over-may-9-violence/articleshow/116546778.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years. Convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites.
