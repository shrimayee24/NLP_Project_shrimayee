PATNA: In a moment that highlights both continuity and political longevity, JD(U) president Nitish Kumar will take oath as Bihar chief minister for the 10th time on Thursday, Nov 20, a senior party leader told TOI on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new NDA govt. At least one deputy CM is also likely to be appointed.“The swearing-in ceremony will be organised at the sprawling Gandhi Maidan. Many top NDA leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, other central ministers Rajnath Singh, Dharmendra Pradhan, Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, and the chief ministers of other NDA-ruled states, will attend the grand event,” a senior BJP leader said.State administration officials on Sunday began preparations to turn the Gandhi Maidan event into a major public spectacle.“The Gandhi Maidan will remain closed to the general public from Nov 17 to 20. There will be a complete ban on the entry of common people into the Gandhi Maidan during this period,” the Patna district administration said in a notice issued on Sunday.“The Maidan has been closed for four days to make preparations for the upcoming swearing-in ceremony of the new govt,” a senior official said.Sources said the formula for distributing cabinet berths among allies has been finalised. Along with JD(U) and BJP, the smaller allies – Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV), Manjhi-led HAM-S and Upendra Kushwaha-led RLM – will also join the govt.“The LJP (RV) is likely to get three berths in the new state cabinet while the HAM-S and RLM one berth each. A maximum of 16 ministers from the BJP and 14 ministers and the chief minister from JD(U) will take oath on Thursday,” a senior BJP leader said.According to a notification issued by the cabinet secretariat department on Sunday, the last cabinet meeting of the outgoing govt will be held at 11.30am on Monday.“The cabinet meeting, to be chaired by Nitish, would pass a resolution to make a recommendation to the governor for dissolving the current assembly. From the cabinet meeting, the CM and other senior ministers of the outgoing govt would drive to the Raj Bhavan, where Nitish would submit his resignation and urge the governor to dissolve the assembly,” sources in the NDA said.After submitting his resignation, Nitish will attend a meeting of the newly-elected JD(U) legislators, where he will be formally elected leader of the JD(U) legislators’ party.A senior BJP leader said the saffron party has called a meeting of its newly elected legislators in Patna on Tues. This will be followed by a combined meeting of the NDA legislators’ party. Nitish will then be formally elected as leader of the NDA legislators’ party in the presence of senior BJP leaders. After that, Nitish, accompanied by leaders of all five NDA allies, will go to the Raj Bhawan to stake claim to form the new govt, a senior BJP leader said.The state’s chief electoral officer, Vinod Singh Gunjiyal, on Sunday handed over the list of 243 newly elected members of the state assembly to governor Arif Mohammed Khan at the Raj Bhavan, marking the completion of the electoral process. Later in the evening, the Election Commission lifted the model code of conduct from across the state.Earlier in the day, activity continued at Nitish’s official residence for the second consecutive day.

Rohini Acharya's Controversial Claims Ignite Family and Political Tensions in Lalu Yadav's Dynasty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rohini-acharya-row-lalu-yadavs-sprawling-family-tree-7-daughters-2-sons-and-political-fault-lines/articleshow/125374377.cms,"Inside the Political Dynasty of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi

1. At the top of the sibling line-up is Misa Bharti (49), the eldest daughter. Armed with an MBBS degree, she entered public life early and went on to serve as a Member of Parliament from Patliputra. Married to computer engineer Shailesh Kumar, Misa’s name itself has historical resonance, drawn from the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) under which Lalu was jailed during the Emergency.

2. The second daughter, Rohini Acharya (46), is also a doctor. Based in Singapore with her husband Samresh Singh, she earned widespread admiration for donating a kidney to her father, a gesture she once described as giving “just a small chunk of flesh.” In recent years, however, she has chosen to step back, publicly declaring that she was distancing herself from both politics and the family.

Among the other daughters, several have pursued quieter paths.

3. Chanda Singh, married to pilot Vikram Singh, keeps a low public profile.

4. Ragini Yadav, who studied engineering, is married to Rahul Yadav, a Samajwadi Party figure.

5. Hema Yadav, believed to have a BTech background, is married to Tej Yadav and remains largely out of public view.

6. Anushka “Dhannu” Rao, whose academic interests include interior design and possibly law, is married into a politically active Haryana family through Chiranjeev Rao.

7. The youngest daughter, Raj Lakshmi, an engineering graduate, married Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, extending the family’s ties to yet another political lineage.

Among the sons, the dynamics were always more intense.

8. Tej Pratap Yadav (37) has served as a minister in Bihar and held various public roles. His journey, however, took a dramatic turn in 2025 when Lalu expelled him from both the family and the party, citing “irresponsible behaviour.”

(37) has served as a minister in Bihar and held various public roles. His journey, however, took a dramatic turn in 2025 when Lalu expelled him from both the family and the party, citing “irresponsible behaviour.” 9. The youngest, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav (35), emerged as Lalu’s political successor. Despite leaving formal education after Class 12, he rose swiftly to serve as Bihar’s deputy chief minister. Married to Rajshree Yadav, he is also the father of two children.





PATNA: The family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former chief minister Rabri Devi has long been central to Bihar’s political landscape.Married in 1973, the couple raised nine children, seven daughters and two sons each carving out a distinct identity within and beyond politics. Together, they form one of India’s most recognisable political dynasties.Together, these nine siblings form a complex and far-reaching family network — blending politics, professional careers, and cross-state alliances.Tensions had been quietly accumulating over the years as Tejashwi consolidated control within the RJD, increasingly relying on a coterie of advisers, a move that some siblings viewed as exclusionary. The party’s poor showing in the recent Bihar assembly elections — winning only 25 of the 143 seats it contested — intensified scrutiny of this leadership style.The situation escalated this week when Rohini Acharya publicly alleged that she had been mistreated at the family home and unfairly targeted by individuals close to Tejashwi. Her remarks prompted three of her sisters — Ragini, Chanda, and Raj Lakshmi — to leave their parents’ Patna residence, adding to the perception of a widening divide.Tej Pratap, who had himself fallen out with the party and was publicly disowned by Lalu last year, came out strongly in Rohini’s support, saying her treatment was unacceptable. His reaction underscored the emotional and political complexity of the family’s evolving dynamics.The RJD’s top leadership, including Lalu and Tejashwi, has so far maintained a deliberate silence. Party insiders suggest that the emerging questions around decision-making and the role of Tejashwi’s advisers have been simmering for months and are now surfacing as the organisation grapples with its electoral setback.Amid the uncertainty, JD(U) leaders have publicly urged Lalu to address the matter, arguing that the unfolding discord has broader implications for Bihar’s political landscape.","The family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former chief minister Rabri Devi has long been central to Bihar’s political landscape.

Delhi Police file new FIR; uncovers 'deeper conspiracy' in Red Fort car blast; doctor module used ‘spycraft’ tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-car-blast-probe-intensifies-fir-uncovers-deeper-conspiracy-doctor-module-used-spycraft-tactics/articleshow/125340660.cms,"Delhi Blast: Security Forces Demolish House of Red Fort Bombing Accused Umar Nabi in Pulwama





NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has filed an FIR to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near Red Fort.The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA. The special cell has invoked sections of criminal conspiracy in this FIR and will reportedly make arrests soon.The blast was so powerful that the ground nearby shook, intelligence sources said on Friday, citing fresh CCTV footage of underground areas of Red Fort metro station. It shows the entire station experiencing a significant tremor causing goods on a cart to shake and rattle. The footage also reveals widespread chaos as panic-stricken commuters run for safety.Explosive experts who picked up samples from the spot are yet to give their report detailing the nature of the bomb, though police maintain Umar Un Nabi, who was behind the wheel when the car blew up, possibly used military grade explosives.Sleuths examined new CCTV footage of the route taken by Umar. “While travelling on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but didn’t eat anything and slept in his car, the footage shows.On the day of the explosion, Umar stopped at a small shop in Wazirpur and had tea. He was there for around 15 minutes but didn’t talk to anyone,” said a cop.Meanwhile, two doctors were detained for questioning from Haryana’s Nuh district on Thursday night, sources said. One of them pursued an MBBS course from China and recently finished an internship at Al-Falah University. Police informed his family that he was detained for questioning after he allegedly talked to some terror suspects.Suspicious numbers were found on his mobile phone, the cops claimed. The person recently appeared for a job interview at a prestigious medical institution in south Delhi. The other doctor also interned at Al-Falah.Haryana’s Nuh district has come under the radar of intel agencies following the blast. In the last week, five suspects — three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam — were taken into custody from the area. Multiple raids have been conducted in the district, which was earlier known as Mewat.Sources in the agencies suggest ammonium nitrate, which could have been used in the explosion, was purchased from Nuh. This suspicion is fuelled by reports that past locations of Umar and his doctor colleague, Muzammil, have been traced to Mewat on multiple occasions.The probe has revealed members of the ‘doctor module’ would draft emails in a shared account without sending them. The recipient would log in, read the draft and delete it to avoid leaving digital evidence. This method is generally used in spycraft. The module also used the Threema app, which operates without phone numbers or email IDs, and possibly created a private server to share maps and locations.","The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA.

Bangladesh witnessed a series of crude bomb explosions in Dhaka on Sunday, police confirmed to Reuters, heightening tensions across the capital ahead of Monday's verdict in a case against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over alleged violence during last year's street protests.No casualties were reported, but the incidents added to the anxiety already gripping the city after days of unrest. Security was tightened overnight across Dhaka and other regions amid sporadic arson attacks and crude bomb blasts.Hasina, 78, is being tried in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering a deadly action against student demonstrators in mid-2024. She denies all allegations and has been in India since fleeing there following her ouster in August last year.Security agencies - including military, paramilitary and police units - were placed on heightened alert after reports that Hasina's now-defunct Awami League had announced a two-day shutdown ahead of the International Crimes Tribunal–Bangladesh (ICT-BD) verdict.On Sunday night, unidentified assailants set fire to a vehicle dumping corner inside a police station complex and detonated two crude bombs outside the residence of an advisory council member of interim government chief Professor Muhammad Yunus.Several intersections across Dhaka also witnessed explosions.The Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) issued strict orders to crack down on violent mobs, authorising personnel to shoot if necessary. ICT-BD prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for the former leader.“I stated over the wireless that anyone who sets a bus on fire or throws crude bombs with intent to kill should be shot. This authority is clearly provided in our law,” Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner SM Sazzat Ali said late Sunday.Since November 10, the capital has seen a wave of mostly predawn attacks, including crude bombs detonated at the entrance of the Grameen Bank headquarters in Mirpur, founded by Yunus. Several branches of the bank were also targeted with coordinated petrol bomb and arson attacks, officials said.Multiple buses were torched during the week, resulting in the death of a sleeping driver.Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal are facing trial in absentia, while the third accused — former police chief Abdullah Al Mamun — appeared in person and has turned “approver”, apparently seeking leniency.“We have sought the highest possible sentence for Hasina. We also requested seizure of the convicts’ property for distribution among families of martyrs and injured victims of last year’s violent street protests,” ICT-BD prosecutor Gazi MH Tamim said.He added that under ICT-BD law, Hasina cannot appeal to the Supreme Court’s Appellate Division unless she surrenders or is arrested within 30 days of the judgment.The verdict is expected to be broadcast live on state-run BTV, with screens installed at multiple locations in Dhaka. Select parts will be aired after tribunal clearance, and live streaming will also be available on ICT-BD’s official Facebook page.In an audio message posted on the Awami League’s Facebook page, Hasina dismissed the charges and urged supporters to remain calm. “We have seen enough of these attacks and cases, this is just a matter of time,” she said.Interim government home affairs adviser, retired lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said the verdict, “whatever it is, will be executed”.Authorities remain on high alert nationwide to avert unrest.Hasina and several senior Awami League leaders face accusations ranging from murder to corruption and abuse of power. Monday’s verdict relates to five counts of alleged crimes against humanity during the July Uprising of 2024, including killings, attempted killings, torture, use of lethal force against unarmed student protesters, deployment of heavy weapons and drones, and specific killings in Rangpur and Dhaka.Hasina insists she is being targeted, accusing interim government chief Yunus of plotting her ouster. She labelled him a “usurper”, saying, “Let them try me, I don’t care… The verdict will not be able to gouge my mouth.”Calling the charges “entirely false”, she added, “If someone makes a false complaint in court, he is tried under law, and one day it will happen.” She also cited Article 7(B) of the Constitution, saying, “If someone by force removes the elected representatives from power, they will be punished. Yunus just did it.”","Sheikh Hasina, 78, is being tried in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity.

SRINAGAR: Inspector Asrar Ahmad Shah called his cousin at 10.50pm on Friday, asking him to wait on the highway so they could drive home to Kupwara together after work. Thirty minutes later, an explosion ripped through Srinagar's Nowgam police station, killing Asrar and eight others. The victims were police officers, forensic personnel, revenue officials and a tailor, all between 30 and 45.The cousin who had waited for Asrar spent the night visiting Srinagar hospitals before finding his body in the police mortuary the next morning. By then, social media was flooded with hashtags of heartbreak and outrage over yet another of Kashmir's recurring tragedies.Asrar, 37, was an MBA from the University of Kashmir who joined J&K Police in 2010. He was a father of three.A video of a young man playing with his infant daughter at home bore the caption, ""His daughter's giggles still echo in that room…She waited for her father to return.""That was 33-year-old Arshad Ahmad Shah, a Crime Branch photographer from Kulgam. Arshad, a father of two, lost his brother in a road accident. His father is a retired cop.Javaid Mansoor Rather, 40, from Tral, was an MA from the same university who changed tracks to specialise in crime photography and join the police force as a constable four years ago.Naib tehsildar Muzaffer Ahmad Khan, 33, from Soibug, did his postgraduation in sports physiotherapy at Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia before joining govt service in 2020. Another colleague in the revenue department, Suhail Ahmad Rather, was killed in the explosion.Constables Aijaz Ahmad and Mohammad Amin were both old hands in forensic investigation at FSL, Srinagar. Showkat Ahmad Sheikh worked as a laboratory assistant there.Tailor Mohammad Shafi Parray was the odd one out. He had been called to Nowgam police station, located in Srinagar's Sheikh Ul Alam neighbourhood, to assist in ""sample collection"".The blast occurred at 11.20pm Friday, tearing through the building and wounding 30 others, including 27 cops, two revenue officials and three civilians. The station had been probing the appearance of Jaish-e-Mohammad posters in the Bonpora area of Nowgam on Oct 19, an investigation that led to the unravelling of an inter-state terror module involving several doctors from J&K and UP.Asrar, posted with the Special Investigation Agency, was to take over the JeM posters case from Nowgam police.As his body arrived wrapped in the Tricolour for his funeral at Shahwali in Kupwara on Saturday afternoon, about 100km north of Srinagar, his neighbour and former Army Captain Mohammad Shafi recalled a poem by Mosiah Lyman Hancock that his ""brother"" had shared on social media in Aug 2020, urging loved ones to remember a person's virtues and happier moments after death.J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat and other senior officers visited the family on Sunday, hailing Asrar as a ""committed, upright and compassionate officer who performed his duties with exceptional professionalism and dedication"".Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said the process of ""sampling"" explosives seized during the probe into the Delhi blast had been underway for two days. ""There is no suggestion of any terrorist conspiracy or external interference in what happened at the police station,"" he said.","Inspector Asrar Ahmad Shah called his cousin at 10.50pm on Friday, asking him to wait on the highway so they could drive home to Kupwara together.

NIA Arrests Alleged Aide Of ‘Suicide Bomber’ Umar Nabi In Delhi Terror Attack

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday said it has arrested an aide of suicide bomber Umer un Nabi who had carried out the Nov 10 car blast, for allegedly facilitating purchase of the car in Delhi and conspiring with the bomber to carry out the terror attack.Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora, Pampore in J&K and in whose name the car involved in the attack was registered, was arrested from Delhi by the NIA, which had launched a massive search operation after taking over the case from Delhi Police.NIA described the arrest as “a major breakthrough” in the Red Fort area car bomb blast case.NIA investigations so far have revealed that accused Amir had come to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the Hyundai i20 car used in the blast. NIA has forensically established the identity of the deceased driver of the vehicle-borne IED as Umer Un Nabi. Dr Umer hailed from Pulwama district of J&K and was working as an assistant professor in the general medicine department of Al Falah College of Medical Science and Research Centre, while also working for a Jaish terror module purportedly planning major, pan-India terror attacks. The massive recovery of over 2,900 kg of explosives foiled these plans.NIA on Sunday said it has seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi. The vehicle is being examined for evidence in the case.The central anti-terror agency has so far examined 73 witnesses, including those injured in the blast that had rocked the national capital on Nov 10 and claimed a dozen lives.“Working in close coordination with Delhi Police, Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, UP Police and various sister agencies, NIA is continuing its investigation across states.

Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar Sparks Row By Singing RSS Anthem In Assembly, Then Clarifies

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Sunday asserted there is “no need” for him to step down as the state Congress president, stressing that his health is “good” and that he has several responsibilities to discharge as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief.“I have worked to build the party day in and day out, and I will continue to do so. My mental, physical and political health is good,” he told reporters in Bengaluru, according to ANI.Shivakumar noted that he must oversee the laying of foundation stones for 100 Congress party offices in Karnataka and is scheduled to meet Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. “We have to celebrate the Congress foundation day (December 28). Who will do all this? I have to do it. Why should I resign from the KPCC presidency? There is no need for it,” he remarked.Describing himself as a “loyal soldier” of the party, he added that he would continue as KPCC chief for as long as the leadership wants him to remain in the role.On whether he would raise rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle during his meeting with Kharge, Shivakumar distanced himself from the matter. “That is left to the CM (Siddaramaiah). He will discuss it with the high command.I am meeting Kharge only to finalise dates for laying the foundation for the new Congress offices. I would like both Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi to lay the foundation stone. I am requesting a date before December 1 as the Parliament session starts that day,” he explained.Shivakumar’s reaffirmation of loyalty comes amid a renewed push from a section of the Karnataka Congress for him to be elevated as chief minister under the so-called “2.5-year formula” that party leaders had reportedly agreed upon after returning to power in May 2023, defeating the BJP."," DK Shivakumar says there is ""no need"" for him to step down as state Congress president.

The warning, first communicated to railway officials in Bhopal, prompted heightened security measures and multiple checks along the train’s route as it travelled from Jabalpur toward Delhi.The 12192 Jabalpur–Hazrat Nizamuddin Shridham Express was halted at several stations for inspections before reaching Mathura Junction, where a full-scale search operation was launched.Station director NP Singh said teams from the Railway Protection Force (RPF), Government Railway Police (GRP), and a dog squad boarded the train shortly after it arrived at platform number two at 10.02am to scan seats, luggage and other areas of the general coach.Security personnel combed through the compartment for any signs of explosives, but no suspicious item was found during the detailed inspection. Officials said the alert had specifically mentioned the general coach, leading to an intensive check that delayed the train’s schedule.With the threat confirmed as a hoax, the Shridham Express was cleared to resume its journey toward Delhi. Railway authorities said investigations are underway to trace the source of the false alarm, which triggered widespread concern among passengers and staff.","Authorities received an alert suggesting a bomb had been planted in one of the train's general coaches.

‘Not a big issue’: Karnataka HM Parameshwara says ‘only cabinet reshuffle’; day after Rahul–Sidda meet spark CM change rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-a-big-issue-karnataka-hm-parameshwara-says-only-cabinet-reshuffle-day-after-rahulsidda-meet-spark-cm-change-rumours/articleshow/125364960.cms,"NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Sunday said there will only be a cabinet reshuffle quashing rumours about a possible leadership change in the state.His remarks came a day after chief minister Siddaramaiah met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, sparking fresh talk about impending changes. While reports suggested that the high command had begun considering a reshuffle, Siddaramaiah dismissed those claims, saying there were “no discussions on the reshuffle” and that the meeting focused solely on the Bihar election outcome.Speaking to reporters, Parameshwara said the matter rests entirely with the chief minister and the party leadership. “It is said that the high command has given permission for a reshuffle. Media is saying it and this subject is coming out in the open. Now you can guess what's happening with regard to the change of guard. Normally, leadership changes do not happen when the Cabinet reshuffle takes place,” he said, as quoted by PTI.He added that several Congress legislators have been pushing for ministerial berths. “Now, after getting permission for a reshuffle, the CM and the high command will do it. To me this is not a big issue,” he said.Public works minister Satish Jarkiholi echoed the position, saying the decision lies with the party leadership. “On Saturday, the chief minister met the party high command. Only he knows what discussion took place with the high command. The decision on the Cabinet reshuffle is left to him and the party top brass,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah reiterated that his meeting with Rahul Gandhi was strictly political and connected to the Bihar results. “Yes, I met Rahul Gandhi. We only discussed the Bihar election. He's our leader, so we encouraged him after a setback in the Bihar election. He said he's not worried about it. We have told him not to lose his spirit. There was no discussion about a cabinet reshuffle at all. I will meet the PM on Monday if I get an appointment,” he said.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar, who previously said he would “follow” Siddaramaiah’s word amid leadership rumours, distanced himself from Saturday’s meeting. “I don't know about the CM's meeting with Rahul Gandhi. I don't know about a cabinet reshuffle discussion... If you want to ask anything about a reshuffling of leadership change issues, speak to CM. We have to follow what the party says,” he said.","Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara says there will only be a cabinet reshuffle.

NEW DELHI: The Lalu Yadav family feud drew reactions from several National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders as they demanded answers from Tejashwi Yadav , who has been accused of hurling ""filthy abuses"" by his sister Rohini Acharya.BJP leader Nitin Nabin said that is Tejashwi had ""become so unpopular in his own family, so how can you think he will be able to move things forward in society?""""It's a family matter, but the way Lalu Yadav has brought his entire family into politics is a bad outcome. Tejashwi Yadav has become so unpopular in his own family, so how can you think he will be able to move things forward in society? Tejashwi Yadav should come forward and answer,"" Nabin, who won from Bankipur Assembly said.Meanwhile, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal said that Acharya was being made ""scapegoat"" for RJD 's crushing defeat in the Bihar polls.""It is their family matter. It (election results) was the responsibility of Tejashwi Yadav, but his aide, Sanjay Yadav, told Rohini to take responsibility. And if his sister was asked to take responsibility for that defeat, how painfully did she take that responsibility? That's why she is talking about retiring from politics, even distancing herself from her family.If they can't take care of their family, how will they take care of society?"" he said.Echoing similar sentiments, BJP leader Dr Guru Prakash Paswan said, ""This is an internal matter of his family. However, if someone is involved in politics or social life, nothing remains private; everything becomes public. The way political questions are raised, first by Tej Pratap Yadav and then by Rohini Acharya, someone must take responsibility for the defeat. Lalu Prasad Yadav has had a long political career. He claims to represent the so-called socially disadvantaged. Yet, with the clouds of an existential crisis looming over him following election results, I believe his party definitely needs to determine its own course.""Tej Pratap Yadav, who himself has been ousted from the family and party, extended support for sister Rohini and said, “Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances. Listen, traitors— If you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away. ”He urged his father Lalu to take action against ""traitor"" who had ""clouded Tejashwi’s judgment.""“Father, give just one signal… just one gesture, and the people of Bihar themselves will bury these traitors. This is not a fight of any political party — it is a fight for the family’s honour, for the dignity of daughters, and for the self-respect of Bihar,” he said.Acharya’s social-media posts on Sunday, alleging humiliation, abuse and expulsion from her parental home, have intensified scrutiny of deepening power struggles within the Yadav family. She said she was “disgraced, abused, and even hit” after raising questions about the RJD’s poor showing in the Assembly polls.""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, filthy abuses were hurled at her, a slipper was raised to hit her. I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not surrender the truth, and solely because of this, I had to endure this insult... Yesterday, a daughter, out of compulsion, left behind her crying parents and sisters and came away; they tore me away from my maternal home... They left me orphaned,"" she said.In another post, referring to her kidney donation to Lalu, she said, ""I did what I did to save my God -- my father -- and today, the kidney is being called 'dirty'... May none of you ever make a mistake like mine, may no family ever have a daughter like Rohini.""Acharya also named RJD leader Sanjay Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav’s close aide Rameez Khan as key figures behind the rift, alleging that their actions drove her to quit politics and leave her parents’ home.","BJP leader Nitin Nabin said that is Tejashwi had ""become so unpopular in his own family, so how can you think he will be able to move things forward in society?""

""Climate change is a lie""— a person who never opened a science book.

Over 99% of climate scientists globally endorse the reality and human causation of climate change, based on the most comprehensive recent literature reviews. This near-unanimity underscores the urgency for action, as affirmed by bodies like the IPCC and national academies.

Karoline Leavitt stirred a fresh row after claiming that climate change is “based on a fallacy."" Environmental activists were not very happy with White House Press Secretary's comments.Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Leavitt accused him of damaging the state with environmental policies she mocked as the “Green New Scam”. She said, “Gavin has done so much damage to his state, with the ‘Green New Scam’ and with this utopian pursuit of climate change that is just so false, it's built on a fallacy, and he's built up energy costs [so much] that people are fleeing the state. ” Her comments run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming.Recently, Congress released tens of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein’s emails, which implicated that US President Trump knew about Epstein and the 'underage girls' in the sex trafficker's house. Democratic lawmakers have also advanced a petition to the White House demanding that even more related records be made public.","Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.

Sakurajima volcano on Japan’s southwestern island of Kyushu erupted several times early on Sunday, sending a plume of ash and smoke up to 4,400 metres (2.73 miles) into the air and causing around 30 flight cancellations, reported Reuters, citing local media.While large volcanic rocks fell as far as the fifth station of the volcano, no pyroclastic flows or injuries were reported.The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) said the first eruption occurred at 12:57 a.m. local time at the Minamidake crater, followed by further eruptions at 2:30 a.m. and 8:50 a.m. Ash from the volcano drifted northeast, prompting forecasts of ashfall in Kagoshima and neighbouring Miyazaki Prefecture.The alert level remains at three on a scale of five, restricting access to the mountain, according to ANI.Sakurajima, located on the southern tip of Kyushu near the city of Kagoshima, is one of Japan’s most active volcanoes. Eruptions of varying intensity occur regularly, including a 2019 event that sent ash as high as 5.5 km (3.4 miles).According to Kyodo News, Sunday’s volcanic activity marks the first eruption to reach 4 km or more in nearly 13 months.","Sakurajima volcano on Japan’s southwestern island of Kyushu erupted several times early on Sunday.

BLAST Rocks Srinagar; Nowgam Police Station Linked To Delhi-Faridabad Jaish Probe Heavily Damaged

NEW DELHI: Nine people were killed and several others sustained injuries after an explosion at the Nowgam police station in the outskirts of Srinagar.According to PTI, the blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives recently seized in connection with the 'white-collar' terror module case.The material had been brought from Faridabad, Haryana, and was part of the 360 kg of explosive chemicals recovered from the rented residence of arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie, officials said, PTI reported.The bodies have been shifted to the Police Control Room in Srinagar. At least 24 police personnel and three civilians have been admitted to various hospitals across the city, the officials said.Five of the injured are in critical condition, and officials warned that the toll may rise.The massive explosion shattered the quiet of the night and caused significant damage to the police station building. Ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the scene, with sirens piercing the air as the injured were taken to nearby hospitals.Small successive explosions after the initial blast briefly delayed rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad. While some of the seized explosives are stored at the police forensic lab, officials said the bulk of the 360 kg cache was being kept at the Nowgam police station, where the primary case linked to the terror module is registered.The terror module was uncovered after threatening posters targeting police and security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. Srinagar Police registered a case on October 19 and formed a special team to investigate.A detailed CCTV analysis led to the arrest of Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, all previously booked in stone-pelting cases—who were seen pasting the posters.Their interrogation pointed to Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian, accused of supplying the posters and radicalising the doctors.The probe eventually led police to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested, and where investigators seized the 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Earlier this week, a powerful blast ripped through a Hyundai i20 near Delhi’s Red Fort, leaving at least 13 dead and several others injured.","The blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives.

Explained: Why MAGA firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene apologised after her public clash with Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-maga-firebrand-marjorie-taylor-greene-apologised-after-her-public-clash-with-donald-trump/articleshow/125375244.cms,"The background: One of MAGA’s earliest shock troops



She backed Trump on every major issue from impeachment to immigration.

She used her social media accounts to amplify Trump’s claims about the 2020 election.

She regularly attacked Republican leaders who distanced themselves from Trump.

The first cracks: Greene challenges the “America First” line



By mid-2025, Greene began voicing public discomfort with Trump’s foreign policy .

. She complained about rising defence spending and criticised military actions abroad.

She said the administration’s focus on external conflicts was “not America First”.

She signalled that MAGA had drifted from the economic populism that energised its base.

October 2025: Full-scale divergence



November 2025: Trump finally hits back



Trump withdrew his support for Greene.

He accused her of “changing sides” and “giving comfort to the Left”.

MAGA-aligned commentators and activists began attacking her online.

Greene says she forgives Trump but president calls her 'traitor', 'disgrace'.

The apology: A rare moment in US politics



Why the apology matters



1. It signals internal unease within MAGA

2. It shows Trump’s control is still absolute

3. It reopens the debate on MAGA’s future

The big picture



Who is Marjorie Taylor Greene?







For years, Marjorie Taylor Greene was the most reliable avatar of Trumpism. She wore “Trump Won” masks on the House floor, called the 2020 election stolen, attacked Republican colleagues who questioned Trump, and turned congressional hearings into performance art for the MAGA base. Which is why the sudden unraveling of the Trump–Greene alliance in November 2025 landed like a small political earthquake. A figure once seen as the movement’s loudest fighter had become its newest traitor. Within forty-eight hours, Greene had criticised Trump’s agenda, received a furious presidential counterattack, and issued a public apology for her own role in toxic politics.This is the story that explains how a loyalist became a liability.When Greene entered Congress in 2021, she arrived as a Trump-world celebrity. Her identity as a political figure was inseparable from the MAGA brand.Inside the movement, she was seen as someone who would never break ranks. Which is what made the first signs of friction so noticeable.These comments were small on their own, but coming from Greene, they suggested the earliest ideological split inside the movement.Through October, Greene sharpened her criticism. She accused Trump’s inner circle of ignoring domestic issues such as inflation and healthcare.She also argued that MAGA had turned into a personality cult rather than a policy movement. Trump’s aides wrote this off as attention-seeking, but the rumblings were enough for MAGA influencers to begin turning on her.The breaking point came in mid-November.Greene responded by suggesting that Trump’s posts had triggered threats against her. She linked the escalation to her renewed push for the release of sealed Epstein files, a cause she claimed invited hostility from all political camps.On 16 November 2025, Greene appeared on national television and apologised for a political career built on outrage. She said the atmosphere in Washington was “poisonous”. She also referenced the assassination of commentator Charlie Kirk as a warning of how political rhetoric could spark real-world violence.Her statement was brief but remarkable. Few MAGA figures have ever apologised for rhetoric or behaviour that fuelled division, and even fewer have done so while directly at odds with Trump.The Trump movement has long enforced loyalty as its most important virtue. If a founding loyalist like Greene can walk back her tone, it suggests that parts of the movement are rethinking the cost of perpetual confrontation.Greene’s downfall was swift because Trump still dictates the boundaries of acceptable behaviour on the Right. Once he withdrew support, Greene’s political insulation vanished.Her criticisms, especially on foreign policy, reflect a growing tension between populist isolationism and Trump’s more aggressive projection of American power abroad. This division is likely to shape Republican politics through 2026 and beyond.The Trump–Greene split is more than a personal feud. It reflects a movement that is changing character. MAGA began as a populist revolt against the Republican establishment. It is now a consolidated governing machine that tolerates no internal dissent. Greene’s apology, while framed as a call for civility, is also an acknowledgment that even the most strident supporters cannot survive outside Trump’s approval.For Trump, the episode reinforces his dominance. For Greene, it is a political reset. For the Republican Party, it is another chapter in the story of a movement that continues to reshape itself around one man.Marjorie Taylor Greene is a Republican congresswoman from Georgia who built her political identity as one of the most uncompromising figures in the Trump era. Elected in 2020, she quickly became known for her confrontational style, viral outrage videos and intense loyalty to Donald Trump . Before entering Congress, Greene ran a CrossFit gym, embraced fringe conspiracies online and cultivated a grassroots following that loved her defiance of political norms.

Sonbhadra mine collapse: Toll rises to 4; rescue operations continue as several still trapped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/sonbhadra-mine-collapse-death-toll-rises-to-4-rescue-operations-continue-as-several-still-trapped/articleshow/125375548.cms,"



VARANASI: The death toll in the Sonbhadra mine collapse rose to four after three more bodies were recovered during rescue operations on Monday, officials said. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon at the Billi Markundi mining site while workers were drilling, burying several labourers under rocks and debris.On Saturday night, the body of 28-year-old Raju Singh Gaud was recovered. Following the subsequent recovery of three more workers, the total number of confirmed fatalities has reached four, while officials continue to search for any others trapped in the mine.An FIR has been lodged by Obra police against Krishna Mining Works, the firm holding the lease for the site, and two of its staff members, Madhusudan Singh and Dilip Keshri, under Section 105 (culpable homicide).The complaint was filed by a local resident, Chhotu Yadav, whose brothers, Indrajeet Yadav (31) and Santosh Yadav (29), remain missing. He alleged that the collapse occurred due to negligence in adhering to worker safety standards.District authorities, including District Magistrate Badrinath Singh, ADG Piyush Mordia, Mirzapur Divisional Commissioner Rajesh Prakash, and IG RP Singh, have been monitoring the rescue operations on-site since Saturday evening.The NDRF, SDRF, and police teams have been working around the clock to remove debris, with arrangements in place to continue operations during night hours.Locals claim that 18 labourers were working at the site at the time of the collapse, though officials suggest that seven or eight may have been trapped under the debris. Authorities confirmed that the mine has a valid lease until 2026 and permission for blasting. The District Magistrate stated that the incident occurred while drilling to create holes for blasting, and a detailed investigation will determine any lapses or negligence.Tensions flared on Sunday when Samajwadi Party MP Chhotelal Kharwar and his supporters attempted to reach the site. Police prevented them from entering and used mild force to disperse the crowd. Kharwar alleged that illegal mining, allegedly under political patronage, contributes to frequent accidents in the area. Officials, however, reiterated that the company’s lease and blasting permissions are valid.Focus remains on the ongoing rescue efforts, with authorities prioritizing the safe recovery of all trapped workers.","The death toll in the Sonbhadra mine collapse rose to four after three more bodies were recovered during rescue operations on Monday.

NEW DELHI: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday launched attack on the Centre over the Red Fort suicide blast, accusing the government of projecting a false sense of normalcy in Jammu & Kashmir while ignoring growing radicalisation and insecurity across the country.""You told the world that everything is alright in Kashmir, but the troubles of Kashmir echoed right in front of the Red Fort.

Ali had travelled to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the Hyundai i20 car that was later turned into a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED), the agency said.The car was registered in Ali’s name.Investigators also confirmed the identity of the deceased bomber as Umar Un Nabi, an assistant professor in the general medicine department at Al-Falah University in Faridabad.His second vehicle has also been seized for forensic examination.The NIA has examined 73 witnesses so far, including several of the injured. Working with Delhi Police, J&K Police, Haryana Police, UP Police and other agencies, it is tracking multiple leads to uncover the broader network behind the attack.During the probe, investigators recovered three 9mm cartridges—two live and one empty—from the blast site, an unusual find in a suicide bombing. Police are examining how the ammunition reached the spot, given that 9mm cartridges are prohibited for civilian use.The agency has also come across online chats linked to the module, including attempts to influence other youths“including women” towards extremist actions.The high-intensity blast in a Hyundai i20 car near the Red Fort metro station on 10th November evening left at least twelve people dead and several vehicles charred.","Mehbooba Mufti accuses Centre of projecting a false sense of normalcy in Jammu & Kashmir while ignoring growing radicalisation and insecurity across the country.

Dhaka Burns Ahead Of Sheikh Hasina Verdict; Yunus Govt Struggles To Contain Unrest Across Bangladesh





Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina ’s son Sajeed Wazed said on Sunday that his mother is “upset, angry, outraged” as the country awaits a crucial court verdict that could sentence her to death.He warned that supporters of the Awami League will block next year’s national election if the party’s ban is not lifted. Hasina’s son also stressed that his mother was emotionally distressed by the situation“She’s upset, angry, outraged. And we are all determined to fight back by whatever means necessary,” Wazed said in an interview with Reuters.He added that the protests in Bangladesh could escalate into violence if the interim government continues to bar the Awami League from participating in political activities.The remarks came ahead of a televised court verdict due on Monday. Hasina faces charges of crimes against humanity over a deadly crackdown on student protesters in 2024.Hasina denies the charges and says the case is politically motivated.“We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,” Wazed said. He added that demonstrations inside Bangladesh were growing.“Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger, and we will do whatever it takes.Unless the international community does something, eventually there's probably going to be violence in Bangladesh before these elections ... there's going to be confrontations.”Hasina, 78, fled Bangladesh in August 2024 after being ousted from power following weeks of unrest. She has since lived in exile in New Delhi.According to Wazed, India is offering full protection. “What can they do to my mother? My mother is safe in India. India is giving her full security,” he said.The International Crimes Tribunal–Bangladesh is expected to convict Hasina in absentia and prosecutors have demanded the death penalty.Wazed claimed the outcome was predetermined. “We know exactly what the verdict is going to be. They’re televising it. They’re going to convict her, and they’ll probably sentence her to death,” he said.The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, rejects accusations of political interference.A spokesperson said the trial process “functioned transparently, allowing observers and publishing regular documentation” and described any calls for unrest as “deeply irresponsible and reprehensible”. The spokesperson added there were “no plans to lift the ban on the Awami League,” news agency Reuters reported.Political tensions are already high in Dhaka, where crude bomb explosions and arson attacks have been reported on Sunday.Security forces have tightened controls and warned of strict action to prevent violence. Shutdowns called by Awami League supporters have disrupted daily life in several regions.Bangladesh, home to more than 170 million people and a major garment exporter, saw its worst political violence since independence during last year’s protests.A United Nations report estimated up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands injured between July 15 and August 5.Hasina has previously called the charges a “politically motivated charade” and insists she is being targeted for her long rule. She secured a fourth straight term in 2024, in an election boycotted by the main opposition after many of its leaders were jailed or fled abroad.As the country waits for the verdict to be broadcast, authorities remain on high alert across Bangladesh.",Sheikh Hasina faces charges of crimes against humanity over a deadly crackdown on student protesters in 2024.

“sicko mode”

AdrianahLee’s emotional response fuels skepticism as fans debate Wurstfest’s decision

“crocodile tears,”

“sicko mode”





Kick streamer AdrianahLee became the center of intense online debate after an unexpected confrontation at Wurstfest led to an emotional breakdown on her livestream. The streamer, who had been hyping her visit throughout the day, was abruptly stopped by security upon arrival and informed she would not be allowed into the venue. The denial triggered panic and tears on stream, with viewers watching in real time as excitement turned into confusion. The moment spread quickly across X, TikTok, and Kick, sparking competing narratives about what truly happened at the Texas festival.AdrianahLee told her viewers that the situation escalated because she had said on stream that she was going to goat the festival, something she believed security misinterpreted. According to her account, Wurstfest staff viewed the comment as a potential safety concern and issued her a criminal trespass warning on the spot, barring her from entry. She insisted she meant it playfully and had no intention of causing trouble, but the sudden confrontation overwhelmed her. The emotional moment set off immediate reactions, with supporters expressing sympathy while critics questioned the authenticity of her tears.The most heated discussion now revolves around the divide between viewers who believe AdrianahLee was unfairly targeted and those who argue her on-stream meltdown felt exaggerated. Some fans labeled her tears assuggesting she dramatized the moment, while others defended her reaction as a natural response to being unexpectedly trespassed in front of thousands of viewers. Meanwhile, IRL streamers have long faced pushback from venues concerned about crowd behavior, filming issues, and unpredictable situations, making it plausible that staff acted out of caution when hearing herremark.With Wurstfest offering no public statement, the community has been left piecing together context from AdrianahLee’s stream and viral clips. The incident highlights growing tensions between IRL streamers and real-world event policies, especially as venues become increasingly wary of disruptions tied to live broadcasts.In conclusion, AdrianahLee’s Wurstfest fallout has sparked a broader conversation about livestream culture, event security, and audience expectations. Whether her breakdown was a genuine reaction or perceived performance, the incident underscores how quickly IRL moments can escalate, and how fiercely online communities respond when they do.Also Read: Stable Ronaldo says Poggers drama gets ignored while FaZe faces harsh labels","Kick streamer AdrianahLee became the center of intense online debate after an unexpected confrontation at Wurstfest.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

Amid the latest sex scandal, social media went all in after newly leaked Epstein emails hinted that Donald Trump might have had a scandalous connection to someone called “Bubba” — a nickname long associated with former President Bill Clinton.The outrage went viral when many interpreted the phrase as a crude, sexual reference: “Trump blowing Bubba.”Democrats accused Trump of scrambling to deflect blame. He called the controversy a “hoax” on Truth Social and called for the DOJ to investigate Clinton’s ties to Epstein, insisting the outrage was a politically motivated attack. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the MAGA chief.The White House recently shared a photo of President Trump with First Lady Melania, captioning them as the “power couple.” Social media users quickly noted the timing, pointing out that these posts often appear whenever Trump is linked to Bill Clinton in the newly leaked Epstein documents.

Some tried to defend Trump, proposing ‘Bubba’ might simply refer to a non-Clinton individual. Many left-leaning observers called it blatant hypocrisy, seeing it as just another Trump scandal tangled in sex and power.Rather than deny or explain the emails, Trump doubled down in public, demanding probes about other high-profile figures like JPMorgan and Chase.","The White House recently shared a photo of President Trump with First Lady Melania, captioning them as the “power couple.” Social media users quickly noted the timing, pointing out that these posts often appear whenever Trump is linked to Bill Clinton in the newly leaked Epstein documents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125371477,imgsize-1318312,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Scott Bessent grilled after giving wild reason for soaring beef prices in US: 'Cows climbing over Trump’s wall',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scott-bessent-grilled-after-giving-wild-reason-for-soaring-beef-prices-in-us-cows-climbing-over-trumps-wall/articleshow/125370786.cms,"



Scott Bessent stirred a row after claiming that soaring beef prices in US are not linked to economic policies but to an alleged “invasion of cows” across the southern US border.The Treasury Secretary laid out his theory during a Sunday interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News. Bartiromo asked about the rising cost of meat and wanted Bessent’s perspective on the issue. He argued that the beef industry is in a “perfect storm” inherited from the former President Joe Biden administration. But he then blamed migrants from Latin America, saying, “Because of the mass immigration, a disease that we’d been rid of in North America made its way up through South America as these migrants brought some of their cattle with them. We’re not gonna let that get into our supply chain.”Earlier this year, the Department of Agriculture announced a suspension of live cattle, horse, and bison imports across the southern border due to an outbreak of New World Screwworm in Mexico. However, there is no credible evidence that migrants travelling to the US have been transporting livestock at a scale that could affect domestic beef prices, according to the Daily Beast.Likewise, there have been no confirmed cases of the disease in US since the outbreak began in Mexico last November.Bessent’s explanation went vital. Social media users pointed out how unlikely it is that migrants would carry cattle while making such a dangerous journey and noted that there is no verified link between border migration and US meat prices. Beef prices are affected far more by supply chain problems, feed costs, and economic factors than by disease outbreaks or migration.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the beef industry is in a “perfect storm” inherited from the former President Joe Biden administration.

Jon Voight warns of a dark future for New York



A divided reaction from celebrities



Mamdani’s rise and the political backlash





Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight has launched a blistering attack on New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani , warning that the 35-year-old will turn the nation’s largest city into a “socialist crap city” and urging President Donald Trump to intervene before it is “too late.” The Oscar-winning actor made the remarks in a video message posted on X, calling Mamdani a “communist fool” and saying only Trump can “stop this horror. ”In his video address, Voight said Mamdani would “take down the city that never sleeps,” warning that New York could become “a forbidden place of darkness.” He claimed the incoming mayor poses a grave threat to the city’s values, prosperity, and security. “This mayor will destroy this city,” Voight declared, urging residents to stand up for their businesses, property, and “private sanctuary.”He argued that Mamdani has “no right dictating the rules of socialism” for a city built by hardworking Americans and insisted that his mayoralty “should be terminated immediately.”Voight went further, insisting that only President Donald Trump can prevent what he described as New York’s slide into socialist ruin. “He, and only he, can stop this horror,” Voight said, accusing Mamdani of plotting to “destroy New York’s wealth.” The actor described the United States as the “land of our greatest achievement” and called on citizens to defend the “honour of our flag” and the American dream.In the video, Voight portrayed Trump as the final barrier between New York and political catastrophe, urging residents to take his warning seriously.“Let this be a warning to the people — and may God bless,” he said.Mamdani’s election victory on 4 November — defeating independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa — has triggered sharply divided reactions among public figures.

Democrats are going to have to find a new fake leftist to shame people into “voting blue no matter who.” Long live every leftist who doesn’t sell the people out to either capitalist party.

Seems pretty f****d up that Noam Chomsky is staying at Epstein's NY apartment and New Mexico home.

It’s not really surprising as Jeffrey was a world renowned intellectual in mathematics, finance, politics and distinguished professor with solid credentials.

Noam Chomsky secretly loves Israel. He's a Jewish supremacist piece of garbage.

I have repeatedly found over the last decade I no longer can justify having any heroes.





Leaked emails from late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein have revealed a rare relationship between the famed linguist Noam Chomsky and Epstein.Chomsky held multiple meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, according to The Wall Street Journal. Epstein’s private calendar, obtained by the WSJ, shows that the two met on several occasions between 2015 and 2016.The 96-year-old philosopher has faced backlash from some socialists who accused Chomsky of ""manufacturing consent for a child rapist.""The documents were released by Democrats earlier this week. The docs show exchanges between Epstein and Chomsky between 2015 and 2017. According to the BBC, many discussions were academic or personal, covering topics such as politics, world affairs, and linguistics. Some emails also mentioned US President Donald Trump and his incoming administration in 2016. Chomsky said that Epstein donated at least $850,000 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for decades.In one email from December 2016, Chomsky wrote to Epstein: ""I notice your prediction was right about Trump avoiding the White House as far too primitive.""Also read: Epstein emails: List of celebrities named in latest files Chomsky has previously commented on his limited association with Epstein, saying he knew the financier and met him occasionally. He said Epstein helped him move money between his accounts without Chomsky receiving ""one penny from Epstein.""The entire document release includes over 20,000 pages detailing Epstein’s connections to high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, US President Donald Trump, Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon, billionaire Peter Thiel, and many others. Trump has maintained that he parted ways with Epstein around 2004, years before Epstein’s first arrest, and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.The political left on social media was surprised to see Chomsky's appearance in the emails, given his ideological stance against most of the other figures mentioned in the documents.","Chomsky held multiple meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump blowing Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

Marjorie Taylor Greene issued a rare apology for her role in America’s “toxic politics”, speaking on CNN as her public split with President Donald Trump deepens and tension inside the Republican Party rises over issues ranging from H1-B, America First agenda, and the release of Epstein files.The MAGA Congresswoman appeared on CNN on Sunday and was pressed by anchor Dana Bash about attacks from Trump aimed at others in the GOP. Bash said that Greene had not spoken out about such behaviour until the remarks were directed at her. Greene replied, “Dana, I think that's fair criticism, and I would like to say humbly I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics. It's very bad for our country and it's been something I've thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated. .. I'm only responsible for myself and my own words and actions and I am going, I am committed and I've been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics.”Her public apology comes after Greene posted on X on Saturday that she was facing threats from POTUS and that the warnings were “fueled by the most powerful man in the world... The man I supported and helped get elected.”The rift between the two increased in recent weeks as they clashed over issues such as rising healthcare costs during the government shutdown.Greene also took a strong stance in favour of releasing the Epstein files, which reportedly include references to Trump and knowledge of Epstein’s activities.Trump responded on Friday in a lengthy Truth Social post, announcing that he was withdrawing his support for Greene. He called her “wacky” and a “ranting lunatic”, adding that she had “gone Far Left, even doing The View, with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors.”Greene rejected Trump’s claims, saying he “attacked me and lied about me.” She insisted she had not been calling him, but had sent him text messages about the Epstein files which she believes “sent him over the edge.” She added that Trump was coming after her aggressively in an attempt to make an example of her and intimidate other Republicans ahead of next week’s vote on releasing the Epstein files. Despite the fallout, Greene insists she has not changed politically. She continues to promote her “AFAO” slogan, standing for America First America Only.The row erupted when Trump faced a backlash from the MAGA base for saying in a Fox News interview that the United States lacks enough talent and needs more foreign skilled workers. The comments angered supporters who argued it contradicted his “America First” message. Greene was among the first to criticise the president, insisting America already has enough talent and promising to release a plan to ban H1 B visas permanently.","Marjorie Taylor Greene issued a rare apology for her role in America’s ‘toxic politics’ The MAGA Congresswoman appeared on CNN on Sunday and was pressed by anchor Dana Bash about attacks from Trump aimed at others in the GOP.

Democratic candidate Amy Acton attacked Republican rival Vivek Ramaswamy , accusing him of being out of touch with the people he wants to govern in Ohio. Speaking to voters, Acton said she rejects Ramaswamy’s past comments about Americans and Ohioans being “lazy” and “mediocre,” and said he does not see the real challenges facing families in the state.“I’m running against a guy, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has said that people are struggling in Ohio because they’re lazy, they’re mediocre, they’re not working hard enough. And I can absolutely tell you that is not the Ohioans I know or see,” Acton said. She added that “he’s hardly ever in Ohio. He’s flying around in his private jet.”Acton told supporters she entered the governor’s race because “people in my state are struggling” and that she refuses to ignore the influence of “bad actors, special interests, and lobbyists” who she believes have taken Ohio in the wrong direction.The rivalry between the two candidates has picked up a year before the state heads to the polls. Acton has repeatedly brought up Ramaswamy’s 2024 remarks on H-1B visas and his earlier comments about Americans lacking drive. “Vivek Ramaswamy told us how he really feels when he said that Ohioans aren't succeeding because they're lazy and mediocre and watching too much TV,” she wrote in a recent post. “Ohioans are working harder than ever, they're doing everything right, and they just can't get enough breathing room.Ramaswamy hit back by calling Acton “Dr Lockdown,” blaming her for Ohio’s early school closures during Covid. “Dr Lockdown led Ohio to be the first state in the nation to shut down public schools during Covid. Students suffered. Small businesses suffered. Families suffered,” he said.Critics in the MAGA base still grumble about Ramaswamy’s Indian origin and his past H-1B remarks, but President Donald Trump has given him a full endorsement.",Democratic candidate Amy Acton attacked Republican rival Vivek Ramaswamy.

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s daughter is worried about her mother’s safety as the MAGA congresswoman locks horns with President Donald Trump over both the Jeffrey Epstein files and his recent stance on H1-B, foreign skilled workers.Lauren Greene reposted her mother’s warnings, which are being fuelled by the “most powerful man in the world”, on X with the message, “Please pray for my mom’s safety!”The scare comes after MGT said she had begun receiving alerts from private security firms about rising threats following her criticism of Trump.In an X post, she wrote, “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected.”She added that, like herself, several others who opposed Trump had faced danger in the past because they supported anti-Trump rhetoric: “Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now. This time by the President of the United States.”Furthermore, Greene said, “As a woman I take threats from men seriously,” before comparing her experience to the “fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.”She argued that her support for Trump’s agenda makes the president’s “aggression” particularly shocking, saying it “also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls (many of whom are paid).” She added, “My phone is blowing up with constant amazing support. I’m so thankful. The Political Industrial Complex and the toxic violent nature of American politics must end.”The fallout between Greene and Trump became visible on Friday when she slammed his decision not to release more Epstein files, calling it “insanely the wrong direction to go.” Within hours, Trump withdrew his endorsement in a Truth Social post that read, “I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of 'Congresswoman' Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia.” By Saturday morning, he posted, “Marjorie 'Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!”The row intensified as Trump faced a backlash from the MAGA base for saying in a Fox News interview that the United States lacks enough talent and needs more foreign skilled workers.

Senator John Fetterman shared a close-up recovery selfie on X on Saturday, two days after a fall near his home in Braddock, Pennsylvania, sent him to a Pittsburgh hospital with a facial injury caused by a ventricular fibrillation flare-up.The image showed a stitched gash across his cheek as he held an iced coffee. “Twenty stitches later and a full recovery, I’m back home,” he wrote, thanking doctors at UPMC for “putting me back together” and supporters for their well-wishes. He posted the image just two days after he was hospitalised early Thursday.A spokesperson said the senator was out for a morning walk near his home in Braddock when he suddenly became light-headed, collapsed and struck his face. Doctors later determined the fall was triggered by a flare-up of ventricular fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can cause dizziness or sudden loss of balance.Fetterman remained at UPMC for observation and medication adjustments before being discharged and returning home. His office said he was “doing well” and recuperating with his wife, Gisele, and their children.He tried to joke about the incident in a statement on Thursday, saying, “If you thought my face looked bad before, wait until you see it now!”The stitched-up selfie spread quickly across social media, drawing a wave of sympathy, political commentary and fresh attention to Fetterman’s health, something he has addressed openly since suffering a debilitating stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign.Fetterman became one of the most outspoken lawmakers during the ongoing govt shutdown fight, breaking with most Democrats this week to vote with Republicans to reopen the federal govt. He was seen leaving the chamber as the Senate worked to end the longest govt shutdown in U.S. history after a bipartisan compromise at the Capitol in Washington on November 10-2025, and was photographed heading to a lunch meeting with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol on November 15-2022.Members of both parties have faced high-profile health issues this year, prompting renewed scrutiny over medical transparency on Capitol Hill. Fetterman has argued that being candid about recovery and setbacks can help normalise discussions about mental and physical health in public life.He closed out Saturday’s post with a simple promise: “See you back in D.C.”","Senator John Fetterman shared a close-up recovery selfie on X on Saturday, two days after a fall near his home in Braddock, Pennsylvania.

Stephen Bryant, 44, was executed by firing squad at a prison in Columbia on Friday, the South Carolina Department of Corrections said. He pleaded guilty to three murders committed during a 2004 crime spree in which he killed three people and scrawled the message ""catch me if u can"" in the blood of one victim.Bryant was shot by a three-person firing squad of volunteers and was pronounced dead at 6:05 pm (2305 GMT). South Carolina executed three convicted murderers by firing squad this year, the first such executions in the United States in 15 years, AP reported.Since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the vast majority of executions in the country were conducted by lethal injection. A man convicted of raping and murdering a six-year-old girl was executed by lethal injection in Florida on Thursday. It was that state’s 16th execution in 2025, the most in the nation. There were five each in Alabama and Texas.The South Carolina Department of Corrections said Bryant was restrained in a metal chair with a hood over his head 15 feet away from a wall with a rectangular opening. All three rifles had live ammunition and an ""aim point"" was placed over the condemned man’s heart.There were 43 executions in the United States this year, the most since 2012, when the same number of inmates were put to death.Thirty-five of this year’s executions were carried out by lethal injection, three by firing squad and five by nitrogen hypoxia, which involved pumping nitrogen gas into a face mask, causing the prisoner to suffocate. The use of nitrogen gas as a method of capital punishment was denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others—California, Oregon and Pennsylvania—have moratoriums in place. President Donald Trump is a proponent of capital punishment and, on his first day in office, called for an expansion of its use ""for the vilest crimes.""","Stephen Bryant, 44, was executed by firing squad at a prison in Columbia on Friday.
