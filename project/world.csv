He mentioned that around 2.45am on Sunday (after the accident ), the builder (father of the boy) called him up.

The builder told him to claim that he was behind the wheel of the car when the accident had occurred.

The builder’s wife, too emotionally requested him to own up the responsibility of the accident.

The family members gave him different enticements for owning up the responsibility.

After the accident, the minor, his friends and the driver were taken to the police station. Initially, the driver went on claiming that he was behind the wheel. The police did not believe in him and registered the case against the minor, according to Pune police.

The CP said, “Late in the night of May 19, the builder and his family members followed the driver when he was going home. They forced him to sit in their car and drove him to their bungalow in Wadgaonsheri.

The driver was forced to sit in a room and his phone was confiscated by them. No one was allowed to meet him.

The next day, the driver’s wife went to the builder’s bungalow searching for her husband. But she was not allowed to meet him. The builder’s family members made many ‘promises’ to her and requested her to cajole her husband to own up the responsibility of the accident after she created a scene there.

Later in the day, the driver was allowed to return home with a warning. Following this, he was ‘underground’ for two days and resurfaced on Thursday. When we took him to the crime branch for questioning on Thursday, things unfolded on this aspect of the case.

PUNE: The grandfather of the 17-year-old boy, who was at the wheel of the Porsche Taycan car that killed two techies last week, was arrested on Saturday morning on the charge of abducting, threatening and confining their family driver in their Wadgaonsheri residence in a bid to force him to own up the crime.Shocking details have surfaced about the ordeal faced by the driver behind the scenes.

Army chief General Manoj Pande gets a month's extension amid intense speculation on successor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-chief-general-manoj-pande-gets-a-months-extension-amid-intense-speculation-on-successor/articleshow/110444811.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a highly unusual move that could impact the line of succession in the 12-lakh strong force, the government on Sunday granted a month’s extension to Army chief General Manoj Pande just six days before his slated retirement on May 31.The inordinate delay in announcing the successor of Gen Pande, who took over as the 29th Army chief in April 2022 and turned 62 this month, had already triggered wide-spread speculation that a supersession in the military hierarchy is in the offing, amid the continuing confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh as well as the impending move to create integrated theatre commands.The extension by the PM-led appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC) will add further grist to the mill since the next senior-most Army officer, vice chief Lt-Gen Upendra Dwivedi (Jammu and Kashmir Rifles), as well as the one after him, Southern Command chief Lt-Gen Ajai Kumar Singh (Gorkha Rifles), are both slated to retire on June 30.The Army, Navy and IAF chiefs can serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier, while a Lt-Gen rank officer retires at 60 unless he is approved for the four-star rank.A top government official, however, told TOI that “any speculation or controversy is unwarranted” because it had been decided that no senior post would be filled before the election process is completed.“No top-level military or civilian posting has been done in the last one month. The next Army chief was scheduled to take over on May 31, one day before the last phase of polling. Now, the next government can announce the new Army chief in mid-June, who will then take over from Gen Pande on June 30 (both Lt-Gens Dwivedi and Singh will still be in the reckoning),” the official said.The election model code of conduct, however, did not prevent the government from announcing on April 19 that Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi would take over as the new Navy chief from Admiral R Hari Kumar on April 30.While Lt-Gens Dwivedi and Singh are both from the same course, the former became the GoC-in-C of the Udhampur-based Northern Command in Feb 2022 and then the vice chief in Feb this year. Lt-Gen Singh, in turn, became the GoC-in-C of the Pune-based Southern Command in Nov 2022.The next three officers in seniority, whose names were also sent to the ACC, are Northern Command and Central Command chiefs, Lt-Gens M V Suchindra Kumar and N S Raja Subramani, and chief of integrated defence staff Lt-Gen J P Mathew.While there have been a few supersessions for the top post in the hierarchy-conscious armed forces, the only available example of an extension being granted was when Indira Gandhi extended the tenure of Gen G G Bewoor (who in turn had succeeded Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw’s also slightly extended tenure as the Army chief after the 1971 war) in 1975 to deny the post to Lt-Gen P S Bhagat.The present NDA government has also junked the long-enshrined seniority principle two times during its 10-year tenure. First, it superseded two senior Lt-Gens (Praveen Bakshi and P M Hariz) to appoint Gen Bipin Rawat as the Army chief in December 2016, who later became the first chief of defence staff before he was killed in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.Then, Admiral Karambir Singh was appointed as the Navy chief in May 2019, superseding the then Andaman Nicobar Command chief Vice Admiral Bimal Verma. Both the times the NDA government contended it had taken the decision “based on merit, not just seniority”.There have been other exceptions to the seniority principle in the past as well. Indira Gandhi, for instance, superseded Lt-Gen S K Sinha to appoint Gen A S Vaidya as the Army chief in 1983. Similarly, Air Chief Marshal S K Mehra became IAF chief by superseding Air Marshal M M Singh in 1988.“Earlier, a new Service chief was announced two months in advance. These last minute decisions are not good for the morale of the armed forces. There is also increasing politicization of the armed forces, with some top officers actively seeking out politicians to push their promotion claims,” a senior officer said.","Army chief General Manoj Pande has been granted a month's extension. The extension comes six days before his slated retirement on May 31. The next senior-most Army officer, vice chief Lt-Gen Upendra Dwivedi, is also slated to retire on June 30.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110444846,imgsize-40446,width-400,resizemode-4/110444846.jpg"

"Delhi children's hospital fire: Hospital licence had expired, doctors not qualified for newborn care, says cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-childrens-hospital-fire-hospital-licence-had-expired-doctors-not-qualified-for-newborn-care-says-cops/articleshow/110449495.cms,"NEW DELHI: An investigation by police has uncovered glaring lapses in the operations of New Born Baby Care Hospital in Vivek Vihar where a devastating fire occurred on Saturday night, resulting in the deaths of six newborns.The probe revealed that the hospital's licence had expired on March 31 this year, yet it continued to operate without any obstacles. Further, it appears that the doctors lacked the necessary qualifications and expertise to provide care for newborns requiring neo-natal intensive care.According to DCP (Shahdara) Surender Chaudhary, their inquiry disclosed that the doctors held only BAMS (Bachelors in Ayurvedic Medicine) degrees. The hospital also lacked a fire extinguisher and an emergency exit, which are crucial in case of any unforeseen events.Police are also investigating the possibility of an illegal oxygen cylinder filling operation at the hospital. This line of inquiry was initiated after as many as 32 oxygen cylinders were found at the scene and neighbours reported suspicious activities. The hospital did not possess an NOC from the fire department, but the arrested owner claimed it was not required as the hospital building was under 15 meters in height. The fire department plans to evaluate the building's height on Monday to ascertain if an NOC was indeed necessary.Concerning the expired licence, a senior officer stated, ""The licence, issued by Director General of Health Services - which comes under Delhi govt- was valid only until March 31. Even as per the expired licence, the hospital was supposed to be operational for five beds only. However, at the time of the incident, 12 newborn children were admitted there.""Police said initial probe showed the hospital had four branches, with the others located in Punjabi Bagh, Faridabad and Gurgaon. They will also inspect these centres. The accused owner, Naveen Kichi, claimed to have pursued an MD in paediatric medicine, while his wife, Jagriti, a dentist, was involved in running the hospital too.Police are now concentrating on definitively determining the cause of the fire. Some witnesses said there was a fire in the generator and a nearby pole, which led to the incident. Cops have contacted Delhi govt's electricity department and experts to assess the reason behind the fire. ""An electric inspection report from electric inspector is being obtained. A report is also being obtained from Delhi Fire Service,"" said a police officer. Delhi Medical Council has been contacted as part of the ongoing investigation as well.","Six newborns died in a fire at New Born Baby Care Hospital in New Delhi.

BAREILLY: Twelve pilgrims , including three children, were killed in Shahjahanpur when a gravel-laden dumper truck crashed and overturned on a parked bus carrying about 50 people on their way to Purnagiri temple in Uttarakhand on Saturday night.The incident saw a couple of deaths which can best be described as tragic twists of fate. A 10-year-old boy who was sent to fetch a bottle of water by his father moments before the accident , survived while his dad, still in the bus, was killed.Another passenger and his wife, having dinner at the restaurant where the bus had stopped, asked their son to keep a bag inside the bus. As the 15-year-old was doing so, the dumper truck came hurtling onto the bus. The teenager died while his parents survived.Yashraj, 10, travelling with his father Pramod Kumar, 30, who passed away in the accident, recounted to TOI the sequence of events.“Our bus had halted at an eatery and my father and I had dinner together. We then moved towards the bus but my father realised we needed a bottle of drinking water for the journey. So, he asked me to get one. Minutes later, a speeding truck came and crashed into the bus. All the passengers, including my father, were buried under the truck loaded with stones,” said the boy, who still hasn’t been able to come to terms with the fact that his father is no more.Similarly, Rupesh Kumar was inconsolable after the accident. “I was having dinner with my wife and two children. We sent our son Ajeet, 15, to the bus to keep a bag. Ajeet was about to enter the bus when it was hit by the truck. Who could tell that we’ll lose him like this... I can’t believe that this has happened,” Kumar said, tears flowing down his face.Another passenger, Raj Karan, 19, too, lost his mother, Sonwati Devi, 45 in a somewhat similar manner. Karan was at the eatery finishing his meal while his mother had gone inside the bus to sleep. She was killed instantly when the dumper collided with the bus.Providing details about the casualties, SSP Ashok Kumar Meena said, “Eleven pilgrims were killed on the spot and one died at Shahjahanpur hospital. Nine people were injured. The bus was parked next to a roadside eatery on the Gola state highway in Khuthar where passengers were having dinner. Around 11.10pm, a speeding dumper from the opposite direction first hit the bus and then overturned. Cranes were used in the rescue operation which lasted for nearly five hours.”SSP Ashok Kumar Meena further said: “An FIR has been registered against the truck driver under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide) and 269 (rash driving). He is absconding.”","A gravel-laden dumper truck crashed and overturned on a parked bus carrying about 50 people on their way to Purnagiri temple in Uttarakhand.

NEW DELHI: At least nine people lost their lives and extensive damage was caused by severe storms that swept through Texas , Oklahoma, and Arkansas on Sunday. The storms destroyed homes and a truck stop where drivers had sought refuge, marking the latest deadly weather event to hit the central United States. In Texas, near the Oklahoma border, a tornado ripped through a rural area close to a mobile home park on Saturday night, resulting in five deaths, according to officials. Oklahoma also experienced damage from the storms, with guests at an outdoor wedding sustaining injuries. Across the region, tens of thousands of residents were left without power.""It's just a trail of debris left. The devastation is pretty severe,"" Cooke County Sheriff Ray Sappington told The Associated Press.In Denton County, Texas, multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter, but the full extent of their injuries was not immediately known, according to officials. Sappington reported that among the dead in Texas were three family members who were discovered in a single home near the small community of Valley View.Arkansas reported at least two deaths, including a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen from the county's Office of Emergency Management. Another person died in Benton County, Arkansas. Melody Kwok, a county communications director, said that multiple other people were injured and emergency workers were still responding to calls.""We are still on search and rescue right now,"" she said. ""This is a very active situation.""Two deaths were also confirmed in Mayes County, Oklahoma, although details about the deceased were not immediately available, according to Mike Dunham, the county's deputy director of emergency management.This month has been particularly grim for deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection.

These deadly twisters have occurred during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change is contributing to the severity of storms worldwide. April saw the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.In Denton County, Texas, north of Dallas, a tornado overturned tractor-trailers and halted traffic on Interstate 35, according to county spokesperson Dawn Cobb. A shelter was opened in the rural town of Sanger.

An enraged mob led by radical Islamist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists on Saturday attacked the Christian community members in Mujahid Colony, Sargodha district of Punjab, some 200 kms from Lahore, and injured two Christians and 10 policemen. The mob burned and ransacked the homes and properties of Christians.According to the FIR, over 450 people, 50 of them are nominated, surrounded the residence and shoe factory of Nazir Masih (an elderly Christian) accusing him of desecration of the religious book.The mob set fire to the shoe factory, some shops and a couple of houses. ""It also brutally torched Masih but timely arrival of a heavy contingent of police saved the life of Masih and 10 other members of the Christian community,"" the FIR says.Although the family of Masih denied desecration of the religious book but the mob wanted to lynch him.""The enraged mob pelted stones at police personnel when they resorted to baton charge to disperse it.

SEOUL: Chinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea as he met their leaders for the first three-way talks in four years on Monday in Seoul, striving to revive trade and security dialogues hampered by global tensions.Li, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the aging population, Seoul officials said.They may also agree to resume three-party free trade agreement negotiations, which have been stalled since 2019, according to Japanese media reports.At the summit , Li called for the comprehensive resumption of trilateral cooperation with an open attitude and transparent measures, China's official Xinhua news agency reported.He said relations between the three nations had not changed despite profound global transformations.""Our meeting today, first in more than four years, is both a restart and a new beginning,"" Li said, according to a post on X by China's foreign ministry.China and US-allied South Korea and Japan are trying to manage rising distrust amid the rivalry between Beijing and Washington and tensions over democratically ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own.Yoon and Kishida have charted a closer course with each other and to Washington, embarking on unprecedented three-way cooperation with the United States on military and other measures.Monday's summit comes a day after the leaders met separately for bilateral talks with each other.In those meetings, Li and Yoon agreed to a diplomatic and security dialogue and resume free trade talks, while Kishida and the Chinese premier discussed Taiwan and agreed to hold a new round of bilateral high-level economic dialogue.Yoon also asked China to play a constructive role with its partners in North Korea, which is expanding its nuclear weapons and missile arsenal in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.North Korea has notified Japan of its plan to launch a rocket carrying a space satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday.Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and demanded that North Korea cancel the launch because it would use ballistic missile technology in violation of the UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.The trade relationship between China, South Korea and Japan has evolved over the past decade to become increasingly competitive.Those ties have been further tested by US calls for its allies to shift their supply chains for key products, such as semiconductors, away from China.Officials and diplomats from South Korea and Japan have set a low bar for the summit, saying it is uncertain whether there will be major announcements but that just gathering will help the three countries revive and reinvigorate their strained relations.The three leaders are also due to attend a forum with top business executives.South Korea, Japan and China held 16 rounds of official negotiations over a three-way FTA after they first kicked off in 2012.At their last negotiation in November 2019, the three countries agreed on liberalisation at a level higher than the Regional Comprehensive Economic partnership (RCEP), of which they are all members, encompassing areas from trade of goods and services to investment, customs, competition and e-commerce.","Chinese Premier Li Qiang praised what he called a restart in relations with Japan and South Korea.

This decision aims to facilitate political dialogue after the recent unrest, which resulted in seven fatalities and significant damage, according to his office.The president's office said in a statement that state of emergency won't be extended 'for the moment' and will therefore end Monday at 8pm in Paris , which is 5am Tuesday in New Caledonia.The decision aims at ""enabling meetings of the various components' of pro-independence movement FLNKS, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front , and allow elected officials and other local leaders ""in a position to call' for lifting the barricades to go there and meet with protesters, the statement said.Macron repeatedly urged the leaders from both sides of New Caledonia's conflict to remove the protesters' barricades. The two sides involved are the Indigenous Kanaks, who seek independence, and the pro-Paris leaders who oppose it.In the statement, he insisted it is ""the necessary condition for the opening of concrete and serious negotiations'.Macron made the decision after traveling to New Caledonia on Thursday.The statement said 480 additional gendarmes are to arrive on the archipelago ""in the next few hours,"" putting security reinforcements at more than 3,500. Among the seven individuals who lost their lives in the shootings, two of them were gendarmes.Paris imposed a state of emergency on May 15 for a minimum of 12 days in order to enhance police powers. These emergency measures grant authorities increased powers to address violence. This includes the option of house detention for individuals considered a threat to public order. Additionally, authorities have expanded powers to carry out searches, confiscate weapons, and limit movements, with potential imprisonment for those who violate the rules.This month's unrest started when the French legislature in Paris was discussing changes to the French constitution regarding voter lists in New Caledonia.The leader of a pro-independence party in New Caledonia on Saturday called on supporters to ""remain mobilised' across the French Pacific archipelago and ""maintain resistance' against the Paris government's efforts to impose electoral reforms that the Indigenous Kanak people fear would further marginalize them.Christian Tein is the leader of the pro-independence party called The Field Action Coordination Unit. He addressed supporters and protesters in a video message that was posted on social media.In a separate statement, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front called on French President to withdraw the electoral reform bill if France wants to ""end the crisis'.New Caledonia became French territory in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon's nephew and heir.

More severe weather in forecast

VALLEY VIEW: Powerful storms killed at least 15 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas , Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter in a restroom during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US.The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest later in the day. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff.Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, five people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region.In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, said Abbott, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said.""The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,"" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts ofsevere weather , including storms that killed eight people in Houston.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'"" Parra said. ""The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.""Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas.No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, said Abbott, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case.At least five people were killed in Arkansas. One was a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said.In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said.In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death on social media.The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection.Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. ""If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!"" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X.Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.Brooks recommended that travelers passing through threatened areas over the Memorial Day weekend have a plan for a weather emergency.Travelers who have already chosen where to get food and other essentials ""probably ought to be thinking about what could I do if there's a dangerous situation to save my life,"" Brooks said.Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home.In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area.Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed.As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris, and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said.""They were conscious but severely injured,"" Dorantes said. ""The father's leg was snapped.""The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms.By late Sunday, more than 80,000 customers in Arkansas were without power. In neighboring Missouri, more than 90,000 were also without power. Texas reported 27,000 outages while 3,000 were reported in Oklahoma, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us.Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was ""shut down"" due to the damage.The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend.The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans.More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee.The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.","NEW: Death toll rises to 15 in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kentucky. NEW: Tens of thousands of residents are without power across the region. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to Arkansas. Forecasters say the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110449640,imgsize-1498296,width-400,resizemode-4/110449640.jpg"

His mother, Scarlett Wactor, confirmed the heartbreaking news to Fox News Digital.Johnny and a co-worker had stayed late at a rooftop bar where Johnny was bartending to help clean up. They were heading to their cars around 3 or 3:30am when the incident occurred. Scarlett Wactor recounted, ""They were walking to their car, and when they get there, Johnny’s car, which was parked in front of the co-worker’s, looked like it was jacked to one side. From what I understand, he said, ‘Hey, man, you towing my car?’ … And the person looked up and had a mask, and so then I guess he knew they weren’t doing that, and so he stepped in front of the co-worker and then backed up and put his hands up or both, and the person shot him.""The attack took place during an apparent car theft attempt. TMZ reported that the suspects were trying to steal the catalytic converter from Johnny's car. While authorities have not confirmed Johnny's identity, the details match a reported case of three suspects attempting such a theft. Descriptions of the suspects have not been released, a Fox News report said.Scarlett Wactor expressed her anguish, saying, ""What I’d like for everybody to know is that they took a great human being. It is leaving a very large hole in me and his brother’s lives. We just buried my husband, their dad, four years ago. And he was very loved by his friends, his families. He lived life to the fullest, he chased his dreams, a very optimistic, positive person.""Reflecting on the tragic loss, Scarlett added, ""And the crazy thing is, he wasn’t trying to stop them from taking it. They could have just left or taken it, he probably would have just given them the car. They were very much a cowardly person … I hope they catch them, and I hope there’s justice for Johnny. That’s all I can hope and pray for. I will see him again. But down here on Earth, it’s going to be a very, very long road without him for me and his brothers.""Johnny Wactor began his acting career on television in the series ""Army Wives"" and later appeared in shows like ""Animal Kingdom,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" and ""Westworld."" His tenure on ""General Hospital"" spanned 164 episodes from 2020 to 2022. His most recent work was in the horror anthology film ""Dead Talk Tales: Volume I.""Authorities are planning an autopsy, and Johnny's family will bring him back to South Carolina for funeral services once his body is released.

Israeli airstrikes kill 35 in Gaza's Rafah as displaced people are hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrikes-kill-35-in-gazas-rafah-including-women-and-children/articleshow/110447156.cms,"NEW DELHI: Israeli air strikes resulted in the deaths of at least 35 Palestinians and injuries to many others in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah that was set aside for the displaced. Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials provided this information.The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound in Rafah and that the strike was carried out with ""precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence."" It took out Hamas' chief of staff for the West Bank and another senior official behind deadly attacks on Israelis, it said.""The IDF is aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.""The spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza, Ashraf Al-Qidra, reported that 35 people were killed and many others, mostly women and children, were injured in the attack.The strike occurred in the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah. Thousands of people sought shelter there after many had fled the eastern areas of the city, where Israeli forces initiated a ground offensive more than two weeks ago.The International Committee of the Red Cross mentioned that its field hospital in Rafah was receiving a large number of casualties. Additionally, other hospitals were also admitting a significant number of patients.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a ""massacre', holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money.""The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the people's bodies are also melting,"" said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah.Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military reported that eight projectiles were observed crossing from the area of Rafah. Rafah is located at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip. Despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering Israel to stop attacking the city, Israel continued its operations in the area.A number of the projectiles were intercepted. The report stated this. No casualties were reported.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was gathering his war cabinet on Sunday to talk about ongoing operations in Rafah. Israel claims that the UN court's decision provides space for certain military actions in that area.In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to ""Zionist massacres against civilians'.Rafah is situated approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south of Tel Aviv.Israel has stated its intention to eliminate Hamas fighters who are hiding in Rafah and to rescue hostages believed to be in the area. However, the military operation has exacerbated the suffering of civilians and sparked international criticism.Israeli strikes on Sunday resulted in the deaths of at least five Palestinians in Rafah, as reported by local medical services. The Gaza health ministry confirmed that the deceased individuals were civilians.Israeli tanks have been exploring the outskirts of Rafah, close to the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. They have also moved into certain eastern districts, according to residents. However, they have not made a full-scale entry into the city since the beginning of operations earlier this month.Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said the rockets fired from Rafah ""prove that the (Israel Defense Forces) must operate in every place Hamas still operates from'.Defence Minister Yoav Gallant held an operational assessment in Rafah where he was briefed on ""troops' operations above and below the ground, as well as the deepening of operations in additional areas with the aim of dismantling Hamas battalions', his office said in a statement.Itamar Ben Gvir, a hardline public security minister who is not part of Israel's war cabinet, urged the army to increase the intensity of the attacks on Rafah. ""Rafah with full force,"" he posted on X.According to Gaza's health ministry, almost 36,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in the Israeli offensive. The operation by Israel was initiated in response to an attack by Hamas-led militants on southern Israeli communities on Oct 7. The attack resulted in the death of approximately 1,200 individuals and the capture of over 250 hostages, as reported by Israeli sources.The fighting in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya persisted, which had been a site of intense combat in the earlier stages of the war. In a single raid, the military discovered a weapons storage site at a school, containing dozens of rocket parts and weapons.It refuted the claims made by Hamas that Palestinian fighters had kidnapped an Israeli soldier.Hamas media reported that a house in a neighborhood near Jabaliya was targeted by an Israeli airstrike, resulting in the death of 10 people and injuries to others.Truce talks are discussions aimed at reaching a ceasefire or peace agreement.Efforts to agree on a ceasefire and release over 120 hostages have faced obstacles for weeks. However, there were indications of progress over the weekend after discussions between Israeli and US intelligence officials and the Prime Minister of Qatar.An official with knowledge of the matter said a decision had been taken to resume the talks this week based on new proposals from Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and with ""active US involvement.""However, a Hamas official played down the report, telling Reuters: ""It is not true.""Netanyahu's war cabinet will discuss the new proposals, as stated by his office.A second Hamas official named Izzat El-Reshiq mentioned that the group had not yet received any information from the mediators regarding new dates to resume talks, contrary to what was reported by Israeli media.Reshiq restated Hamas's demands, which include: ""Ending the aggression completely and permanently, in all of Gaza Strip, not only Rafah'.Israel is working to secure the release of hostages. Netanyahu has emphasized that the conflict will only cease once Hamas, an organization committed to Israel's annihilation, is eradicated.Aid trucks have entered Gaza.Israel has received requests to increase the delivery of aid to Gaza. This comes after over seven months of conflict that has led to extensive damage and food shortages in the area.Khaled Zayed, a representative of the Egyptian Red Crescent, informed Reuters that a convoy of 200 trucks carrying aid, which includes four fuel trucks, is scheduled to arrive in Gaza on Sunday via Kerem Shalom.An agreement was made between US President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Friday. The agreement involves temporarily sending aid through the Kerem Shalom crossing, as the Rafah crossing has been blocked for weeks.Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV posted a video on social media platform X. The video displayed aid trucks entering Kerem Shalom. Kerem Shalom was previously the primary commercial crossing station connecting Israel, Egypt, and Gaza.The Rafah crossing has been closed for nearly three weeks. This happened when Israel gained control of the Palestinian side of the crossing while intensifying its offensive.Egypt has become more and more concerned about the possibility of a large influx of Palestinians crossing into its territory from Gaza. As a result, Egypt has declined to open its side of the Rafah crossing.Israel has stated that it is not limiting the flow of aid and has opened new crossing points in the northern region. Additionally, Israel is collaborating with the United States, which has constructed a temporary floating pier for aid shipments.(With inputs from agencies)","Israeli air strikes in Rafah kill at least 35 Palestinians and injure many others.

The bombers, belonging to the eastern theatre command of the People's Liberation Army, formed multiple attack formations in waters east of Taiwan and conducted simulated attacks in coordination with naval vessels, Chinese state television CCTV reported.Meanwhile, Taiwan tracked numerous Chinese warplanes and navy vessels near its coast, coinciding with the second day of a significant exercise conducted by China's People's Liberation Army in response to the inauguration of Taiwan's new leadership.China has extensively advertised these maneuvers, showcasing Taiwan's encirclement by forces affiliated with the ruling Communist Party's military arm, the People's Liberation Army. A recent video presentation depicted animated Chinese forces closing in from all directions, effectively enclosing Taiwan within a circular target zone.Despite the situation, there was little evident concern among Taiwan's 23 million citizens, who have lived under the threat of Chinese invasion since the bitter and bloody civil war in 1949 led to the division between the two sides.Taiwan's parliament faced a dispute between political parties over procedural matters on Friday, yet daily activities continued as usual in the bustling capital of Taipei.According to the defense ministry, 49 warplanes, 19 navy vessels, and Chinese coast guard vessels were tracked. Of these, 35 planes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, the de facto boundary between the two sides, within a 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday.Marine and coast guard vessels, along with air and ground-based missile units, have been placed on high alert, particularly around the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, situated just off the coast of China and distant from Taiwan's main island by approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) across the Taiwan Strait.""Facing external challenges and threats, we will continue to maintain the values of freedom and democracy,"" Taiwan's new President Lai Ching-te told sailors and top security officials on Thursday as he visited a marine base in Taoyuan, just south of the capital, Taipei.Lai in his inauguration speech on Monday had called on Beijing to stop its military intimidation and said Taiwan was ""a sovereign independent nation in which sovereignty lies in the hands of the people"".China's military said that its two-day exercises around Taiwan were intended as punishment for separatist factions advocating independence. Almost daily, it dispatches navy ships and warplanes into the Taiwan Strait and other surrounding areas to erode Taiwan's defenses and attempt to intimidate its populace, who staunchly support the island's de facto independence.""As soon as the leader of Taiwan took office, he challenged the one-China principle and blatantly sold the two-state theory',"" China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said in a statement on Thursday night.","China dispatches bombers armed with live missiles for mock strikes as part of its Taiwan drills.

An IDF spokesperson declared, ""This inhumane treatment is unacceptable and must be met with swift and decisive action from the international community.""The release of this video comes at a time of heightened tensions and escalating violence in the region. It underscores the urgent need for a resolution to the conflict and the critical importance of protecting innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.The video serves as a grim reminder of the human cost of the ongoing conflict, where civilians, including women and children, often bear the brunt of the violence. The Hostages Families Forum has called on world leaders to take immediate steps to facilitate the hostages' release and hold those responsible for their mistreatment accountable.International response to the video has been swift, with several countries condemning the actions depicted in the footage and urging both sides to adhere to international humanitarian laws.

By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, officials said. Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding.

Three family members were found dead in one home, Sappington said.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop near Valley View. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, You're very lucky,'"" Parra said.

He can't conjure resources out of thin air,"" Murphy said. ""If he were to try to shut down portions of the border, the courts would throw that out, I think, within a matter of weeks.""Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in Nov. 5 elections, has said his administration is looking at executive actions to potentially block migrants at the border after Republicans rejected the bipartisan Senate bill this year. Republicans spurned the measure after former President Donald Trump, Biden's Republican challenger, came out against it.Senate Republicans blocked the bill again last week and Republican house speaker Mike Johnson said it ""doesn't secure the border"" and ""incentivizes further illegal immigration.""The number of migrants caught illegally crossing the US-Mexico border has dropped this year compared with a monthly record high in December, a trend US officials partly attribute to increased enforcement by Mexico .Murphy said the decrease was due to ""smart, effective diplomacy between the United States and the Mexican government"" but warned that the dropoff may not be permanent and that illegal crossings remain high compared with a decade ago.""We have to just recognize that without updating the laws of this country, without surging more resources to the border, we can't count on the numbers staying as low as they are today,"" Murphy said.White House spokesperson Karine Jean Pierre said last week that the Senate bill would deliver ""significant policy changes, resources, and personnel needed to secure our border and make our country safer.""Migrants and asylum seekers transit through Mexico to the US to escape violence, economic distress and negative impacts of climate change, according the United Nations.","US President Joe Biden has ""limited ability"" to step up security at the US- Mexico border via executive action.

He told the New York Post that he shielded his fiancee and cousin from the burning liquid and his shirt caught on fire. He said he slapped himself to put out the flames. Doctors told him he had burns on about a third of his body, he said.""He had a cup,"" the victim told the Post. ""He made fire and he threw it all.""The suspect, a 49-year-old man, was arrested a short time later after police tracked a phone he allegedly stole from another subway rider to his location, authorities said.

Trump trial reaches its end game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-trial-reaches-its-end-game/articleshow/110442788.cms,"- Other cases -

NEW YORK: The historic trial of Donald Trump enters its final act Tuesday, with closing arguments to the jury who must then decide whether to hand down the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president .Less than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country as a whole.Trump is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter between them that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid .If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.Crucially, a conviction would not bar Trump from appearing on the ballot in November as the Republican presidential challenger to Democrat Joe Biden.It has taken nearly five weeks, the testimony of more than 20 witnesses and a few courtroom fireworks to reach closing arguments -- the last chance for the prosecution and defense to impress their case on the anonymous, 12-member jury.As expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination.For a man who has always prided himself on being in charge and in control, the role of silent, passive defendant did not come easily.At times it has been downright excruciating, especially when Trump was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail.Speaking to reporters before and after each day in court, Trump launched regular tirades against Judge Juan Merchan -- calling him ""corrupt"" and a ""tyrant"" -- and condemned the whole trial as ""election interference"" by Democrats intent on keeping him off the campaign trail.The politics of the case were in full view in the final days when a coterie of leading Republicans -- including several vice-presidential hopefuls -- came to the court and stood behind Trump in a gesture of support as he spoke to the press.In all, he was cited 10 times for contempt of court and fined $10,000 by Merchan for failing to heed a gag order prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, the jury, court staff or their relatives.The judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday.He will then give his final instructions to the jury, who will likely begin their deliberations on Wednesday.To return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.Aside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former ""fixer"" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.Walking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made ""to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.""Trump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.The defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.None of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.",The historic trial of Donald Trump enters its final act Tuesday. The jury must then decide whether to hand down the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president.

Its fifth patrol, described by the NHHC as its ""most successful,,"" saw it engage Japanese destroyers, sinking three and inflicting heavy damage or destruction on two others within four days.During its final patrol, the USS Harder, aided by the USS Haddo, targeted and neutralized three escort ships off the Philippines province of Bataan.Japanese records later revealed that on August 24, 1944, the Harder launched three torpedoes at CD-22, another escort ship in the vicinity, according to the Fox News digital citing the NHHC.""The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks,"" it added, with the ""fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew.""Following its service in World War II, the USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation and six battle stars, the NHHC says","The USS Harder vanished on August 24, 1944, with 79 sailors onboard.
