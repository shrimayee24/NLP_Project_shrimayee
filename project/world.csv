Video Was Backed-up

Follow Procedure: Court





BENGALURU: Swapnil Nagesh Mali, the 30-year-old senior associate consultant at Infosys who was arrested, and later released on bail, for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom, has confessed to the police that he had secretly recorded at least one more woman in the company restroom.During interrogation, Swapnil said he derived ""satisfaction"" from watching such videos and had more than 50 such downloaded clips on his phone.Swapnil, a BE from Ram Nagar in Maharashtra's Sangli district, is the son of a farmer. Police said his parents were shocked and deeply disturbed when informed about his arrest.According to the victim's complaint, around 11 am on June 30, she went to the washroom. While using the toilet, she noticed a reflection on the cubicle door and saw someone attempting to pull something from the adjacent stall.She quickly stepped out and saw another woman exiting one of the other cubicles. To verify what exactly was the matter, she returned to the same stall that she had been to, climbed onto the commode and saw a man standing on the commode in the neighbouring cubicle and recording her. His trousers were off.As soon as she confronted him, the accused began apologising repeatedly. The victim then ran out and alerted her colleagues about the intruder in the women's washroom. Swapnil, who was trying to flee, was cornered and caught by housekeeping staff.According to the police, the victim and another female employee from the company's HR department checked Swapnil's phone, and found the victim's video clip in it. They took a screenshot of the clip as evidence and deleted it from the accused's phone to make sure it wasn't shared.However, according to a senior police officer, the videos were still on the phone as those had not been deleted permanently. ""Once we confirmed that the videos were still thereon his phone, a woman police sub-inspector was told to check those,"" the officer said.""After informing her company HR, the victim returned home and informed her husband about the incident, who advised her to file a police complaint so that legal action could be initiated,"" police said.Subsequently, the victim lodged a police complaint on July 1.When Electronics City police produced the accused in court, the magistrate noted that the sections invoked are punishable with less than seven years' imprisonment and directed police to follow proper arrest procedures and grant station bail.The magistrate also reminded the cops that even minor lapses could lead to the accused being acquitted.","Swapnil Nagesh Mali, 30, a senior associate consultant at Infosys, was arrested for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom.

The men were reportedly forced to apologise publicly and were repeatedly told to use Marathi while conducting business in the state.The video, shared widely on social media, shows Vichare sitting calmly as his party workers confront the traders. One supporter can be seen slapping a trader while demanding an apology and shouting, “Speak in Marathi!”This incident follows a tense week in Maharashtra, where language politics have flared up. After MNS activists attacked a north Indian shopkeeper in Mira Road for not using Marathi, the area’s market remained shut for a day in protest. Traders and local communities demanded protection and accountability from the state.In response to the backlash, Aditya Thackeray attempted damage control, telling the media, “I spoke to Rajan Vichare ji. He said this was not a Marathi vs non-Marathi issue. It began when a party worker was not allowed to charge his phone, and the argument escalated.”But critics aren’t buying it. The visual evidence suggests otherwise, and many have pointed out the growing pattern of linguistic vigilantism, now cutting across political factions.","Rajan Vichare, former MP and senior leader from Uddhav Thackeray ’s Shiv Sena (UBT), is seen summoning traders to his office in Thane.

Partition survivor who was saved by a Muslim dies at 102,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/partition-survivor-who-was-saved-by-a-muslim-dies-at-102/articleshow/122236338.cms,"PATIALA: One of the last survivors of the 1947 Partition died in Dhainthal village of Punjab's Patiala on Tuesday, aged 102. Ram Krishan Singh's life reflected the horrors of communal violence as well as the courage and compassion that shone through despite the bloodshed.Ram Krishan was about 24-years-old during the division of India into two nations, which led to violent upheaval in Punjab. In Aug 1947, a mob murdered his father, Jeona Singh, a carpenter and bullockcart manufacturer, in Dhainthal after he refused to abandon their ancestral home.""My father was killed during those days of hate. Before Partition, our village was largely Muslim, with a few Sikh and Hindu families. Children played in each other's homes. Then, suddenly everything changed,"" Ram Krishan Singh had recalled in an interview with a web channel, Azad Bol Punjabi, four years ago.As communal tensions escalated, Ram Krishan and other family members temporarily fled to nearby Tullewal village. Jeona Singh stayed back to guard their home, along with an elderly Nihang. When Muslim families began migrating to Pakistan, a mob entered Dhainthal and killed Jeona in his home.Ram Krishan's grandson, Hardeep Singh Gahir, a assistant public relations officer in Patiala, said his grandfather went back in search of his father, only to face a grim reality.Gahir said, ""The Nihang who survived told my grandfather that he had to cremate Jeona in a tandoor using cow-dung cakes because there was no safe way to arrange a funeral.""During the strife, Ram Krishan's life was spared by an unexpected act of humanity. When he and other family members were cornered by an armed group, a Muslim villager intervened to protect him. This stranger's bravery became a story Ram Krishan frequently recounted. Gahir shared, ""Even in his last years, he would recall with gratitude how a Muslim man risked his own life to save him.""Following Partition, the family's life in Dhainthal changed permanently. Jeona's wife, who was pregnant at the time, gave birth to a daughter, Mohinder Kaur, two months after Partition. Ram Krishan delayed his own marriage until he was 30 as the family rebuilt their lives. He continued the carpentry tradition, and his son Balwinder Singh still practises the craft, using modern techniques. ""Ram Krishan lived quietly, serving as a witness to history's cruellest chapter and exemplifying resilience. His life was a reminder that even in times of hatred, acts of kindness could echo across generations,"" said his family.","Ram Krishan Singh was about 24-years-old during the division of India into two nations.

NEW DELHI: India has conveyed its concerns to US Senator Lindsey Graham who is sponsoring a sanctions bill that will, if approved, impose 500% tariffs on India, China and others who purchase Russian oil, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.Graham was quoted as saying earlier this week that President Donald Trump had told him to bring to vote the bill that might help the US force Russia to join peace negotiations on Ukraine. Kremlin, however, has warned that it could adversely impact peace efforts.""Any development in the US Congress is of interest to us if it impacts or could impact our interests. We have been in touch with Senator Graham. The embassy and our ambassador have been in contact as well,"" Jaishankar said.While India has traditionally sourced its oil from West Asia, it ramped up purchase from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022.This was mainly because of the discount offered by Russia to offset the impact of western sanctions. India's import of Russian oil grew dramatically from less than 1% of its total crude oil imports to 40% in three years.""Our concerns and our interests on energy security have been communicated to him (Graham).So, we'll then have to cross that bridge when we come to it, if we come to it,"" Jaishankar said.""Russia's stronghold over new markets has solidified in the third year of the invasion.

“Their body language suggest something…”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's subtle body language during NYC dinner hints at their true connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/their-body-language-suggest-something-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-subtle-body-language-during-nyc-dinner-hints-at-their-true-connection/articleshow/122148909.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent Manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential (TheImageDirect.com)

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Popstar Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. Judi James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning— Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

Natasha Cloud fires back at Donald Trump’s Mamdani rant with powerful defense of progressive values



Trump Threatens To Arrest NYC Mayor Candidate Mamdani | ‘Don’t Need Communist In U.S.’

President Donald Trump launched a fiery tirade this week, taking aim at New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani with a string of insults that lit up political discourse across the country. He labeled Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” attacking his appearance and voice. Trump’s rant drew swift condemnation, including a sharp and passionate response from WNBA star Natasha Cloud. The New York Liberty star didn’t hold anything back as she defended Mamdani and called out the broader implications of Trump’s comments.Speaking after the New York Liberty practice session, Natasha Cloud addressed Trump’s remarks head-on, calling his comments both dangerous and telling of something bigger unfolding. “It's reckless of our president. It's reckless of this administration, but it's also exciting for us as the people,” Cloud said.“That's when you know we're getting to them. That's when you know we're creating change that they don't want. That's when you know we're dismantling the system. And so for all of us in New York, I'm just gonna ask that we continue to be on the right path to history.""Cloud also pushed back against how his identity is being used to discredit him.“He gets the worst PR because he's a Muslim, he's a socialist, and he's a democrat,” she said. “But he believes that it is the government's right to take care and make sure that all its constituents live a dignified life, regardless of who you are, what your religious affiliation or background is. I think that's beautiful.""Trump’s attacks, made on Truth Social and in front of reporters, went far beyond policy critiques. He mocked Mamdani’s intelligence, look, and speaking voice, saying, “He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart.” The former president even invoked the “AOC+3” label and sarcastically suggested Mamdani be part of a future all-communist Democratic cabinet. “Our Country is really SCREWED!” he wrote, per the New York Post.In another exchange, Trump threatened legal action if Mamdani refuses to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. “Well, then we'll have to arrest him,” Trump said. “We don't need a communist in this country… we send him money, we send him all the things that he needs to run a government.”Also Read: Jalen Brunson raises eyebrows with unexpected take on New York Knicks’ coaching situation The back-and-forth has drawn intense media coverage, but Cloud’s response has struck a chord with many.

PUNE: A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.""He also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,"" deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI on Thursday. ""We have seen the cropped selfie image and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting the gadget from her,"" he said.The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar and has been staying with her younger brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI. The society is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into ‘A', ‘B' and ‘C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents.The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone in the flat when the ""delivery agent"" came calling, police said.DCP Shinde said: ""The woman said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying, and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment to step in and bolted the door from inside before using the spray on her face. ""He said: ""The woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams from the Kondhwa police and the city crime branch have been deployed to work on leads to arrest the culprit. ""Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said.""We have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,"" said an officer, who is part of the probe. The police have registered a case relating to offences punishable under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI: ""We have collected the survivor's oral and nasal swab to establish the chemical substance alleged to have been used to render the survivor unconscious. We are certain about detecting the case soon and have roped in all our resources considering the nature and gravity of the crime.""Preliminary investigation revealed that the intruder did not make an entry in the visitors' register maintained by the society. ""We are questioning the society residents and security guards and also pursuing technical leads to identify, trace and nab the culprit,"" additional commissioner of police (Crime) Pankaj Deshmukh said. The guards on duty have so far maintained that there was no entry or exit of any person around the time of the incident nor any outsider has been spotted in CCTV covering the passage leading to the ‘A' wing where the survivor stays.A society office bearer told TOI at the site: ""The brother-sister duo share a cordial relationship with all our members and have been paying their rent on time to the flat owner, who lives in Mumbai. The society is covered by two CCTV cameras. The 'A' wing, where the incident occurred, has CCTV cameras covering the passage, parts of the other wings and the parking area.""He said: ""We have installed a mobile application, a visitor management facility, to regulate entry on the society premises. Each member and tenant of the society has this application on their mobiles. We studied all the entries and exits on the application and realised that no delivery persons — like food delivery, quick commerce or e-commerce — entered the society when the incident occurred. We have provided all details of the cellphone application and CCTV footage to the police. ""The office-bearer added: ""Only one thing could have happened. A delivery person, who has four or five deliveries to make in different flats, could have entered the society and then might have gone to the woman's flat. It does not require a separate entry on the mobile application when it comes to multiple deliveries.""","A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.

AURANGABAD: In a chilling case reminiscent of the infamous Meghalaya honeymoon murder, a newlywed woman in Bihar's Aurangabad district allegedly conspired with her uncle to have her husband killed just 45 days after their wedding. The woman, accused of masterminding the murder, was arrested on Wednesday evening along with two alleged accomplices.According to Aurangabad SP Ambarish Rahul, 32-year-old Priyanshu Kumar Singh was shot dead by unidentified assailants on the night of June 24 while returning from Nabinagar railway station. Initial investigations suggested it was a contract killing.However, as the probe progressed, police uncovered a far more disturbing truth - the murder had been orchestrated by his wife, Gunja Singh, 30, in collusion with her uncle (paternal aunt's husband), 52-year-old Jeevan Singh.""The woman had been in an illicit relationship with her uncle for over 15 years and was reluctant to marry. But under pressure from her family, she tied the knot with Priyanshu in May,"" the SP said. Unable to maintain the secret affair after marriage, she allegedly plotted her husband's murder, drawing inspiration from the recent Meghalaya case in which a woman was accused of killing her husband during their honeymoon.Police said Jeevan arranged for contract killers with the help of two men from Jharkhand’s Garhwa district – Jaishankar Chaubey and Mukesh Sharma – who procured sim cards and provided logistical support.On the night of the murder, Priyanshu, returning from Varanasi, called his wife to inform her of his location. Gunja is alleged to have passed on the information to the killers, who then fatally shot him. Gunja was arrested on Wednesday and, during interrogation, confessed to her role in the crime.The two alleged accomplices were also taken into custody. Jeevan remains on the run and a search operation is underway to arrest him. Police have seized Gunja’s cellphone, and her call records are being treated as crucial evidencein the case.","A newlywed woman in Bihar's Aurangabad district allegedly conspired with her uncle to have her husband killed just 45 days after their wedding.

NEW DELHI: In a horrific double murder, a 24-year-old worker in a garment shop entered the Lajpat Nagar residence of his employer and slit the throats of his wife and teenage son on Wednesday evening. The accused, Mukesh Paswan, managed to flee the city after the crime but was arrested from a train in UP.Mukesh, who also ransacked the house, later blamed the crime on a fit of rage triggered by a scolding he got from the woman over a Rs 45,000 advance he had taken from her and his frequent absence from work. However, police said they were yet to ascertain the motive and would interrogate him after he arrived in Delhi late on Thursday.The victims were identified as Ruchika Sewani (42) and her son Krish (14). The family lived in F block, Lajpat Nagar, and ran a garment business from an establishment in the same locality. The murders took place around 7.30pm and were discovered over two hours later.The gruesome double murder of a woman and her 14-year-old son in south Delhi Lajpat Nagar on Wednesday evening was discovered after repeated calls by the woman's husband went unanswered, prompting him to send a worker at his garment shop to check on them.Police received a PCR call at 9.43pm on Wednesday from Kuldeep Sewani (44), saying his wife Ruchika and son Krish were not responding to calls.Arnab (22), a neighbour of the Sewanis, said the worker sent by Kuldeep to the house had called back with grim news. ""The worker saw bloodstains at the gate and on the stairs, and informed Kuldeep that the phone was ringing inside the house. Kuldeep rushed home and kept knocking on our door. We also came out and a call was made to the police,"" he said.Cops forced open the gate and found Ruchika's body in a room, and her son's in the bathroom. They had been attacked with a sharp object and had deep neck injuries.He added that the incident came to light around 9.30pm. Due to the sound of their air conditioner, no one had heard anything unusual during the assault.Police began reviewing CCTV footage from the area. In one of the cameras, they spotted Mukesh coming out of the building. This raised suspicion and police sent out an inter-state alert. Soon, Mukesh was apprehended by UP police at Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction while attempting to flee on a train.Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) Hemant Tiwari said a murder case was registered. According to police sources, the accused claimed he took a Rs 45,000 advance due to financial need. Ruchika gave him the money but he started taking leaves and stopped answering her calls. Eventually, she managed to contact him through an employee, and he agreed to return the advance and hand back a phone. However, he flew into a rage over a woman having scolded him.The source said he went to Ruchika's house, which was on the ground floor, and rang the bell. She let him in thinking he had come to talk about why he wasn't coming to the shop. ""He gave her no chance and started attacking her with a sharp object,"" the source added.Hearing his mother's scream, the son, who had returned from cricket coaching session, tried to save her but was also attacked. He tried to hide in the bathroom but Mukesh got to him. The murder weapon is yet to be recovered. The accused entered the house between 7pm and 7.30pm, about 10 minutes after Ruchika arrived home from the shop.Police are probing whether Mukesh had cut the CCTV camera wire before entering. After the murder, he rushed to the railway station.","Mukesh Paswan, 24, slit the throats of his wife and teenage son on Wednesday evening.

BENGALURU: A 30-year-old man ended his life inside the premises of SNR District Hospital in Kolar (60 kms from the tech capital), just hours after his marriage was formally registered.The deceased, identified as Harish Babu, a resident of Nayakarahalli in Kolar taluk, was working as a data entry operator with the E-Hospital wing of SNR Hospital for over a decade. On Wednesday, Harish had his marriage registered at the sub-registrar’s office in Kolar, in the presence of elders from both families. The couple, colleagues at the same hospital, had been in a relationship for some time.Sources said that following the registration, Harish returned to his native village with his mother. Later that evening, he came back to Kolar, citing official work at the hospital. However, during the night, he allegedly consumed liquor and took his own life by hanging himself with a bandage cloth inside one of the OPD sections of the hospital.The incident came to light on Thursday morning, sending shockwaves among hospital staff and locals. Colleagues recalled that Harish and the woman had been in a relationship for several years.The woman, a fellow data entry operator from Gandhinagar in Kolar, had reportedly been urging Harish to marry her. Although their families had recently come together to formalize the relationship, sources said Harish appeared reluctant in the days leading up to the wedding.According to those familiar with the couple, a meeting involving elders from both sides was held near Kolar Railway Station on July 1. It was agreed that the marriage would be registered immediately, with ceremonial rituals to follow after the inauspicious Ashada month. However, after the registration, Harish seemed withdrawn.Police suspect that he took the extreme step around midnight. While the exact reason for the decision remains unclear, preliminary inquiries suggest emotional strain surrounding the marriage may have played a role.","The deceased, identified as Harish Babu, was working as a data entry operator with the E-Hospital wing of SNR Hospital.

When Eric Johnston, who befriended Stalin at the Kremlin in 1944, was asked if he thought ‘Uncle Joe’ — short for Joseph Stalin — would start WW-3, he replied, “He is an old man, and old men do not start wars. ” How wrong he was. Hitler was 50 when he started WW-2 in 1939 – a ripe old age when Germany’s average life expectancy was 61. Mussolini was 56, Stalin 60, and Roosevelt too was nudging 60 when the US entered the war in December 1941.Life expectancy has increased everywhere since then, and so have the ages of the lead figures in today’s wars. Ismail Haniyeh was 61 when he ordered the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel from the safety of Qatar. Putin is 72, Netanyahu 75, Trump 79, and Khamenei 86. Alexander of Macedon was indeed young, just 22, when he set out to conquer the world, but he was an exception.If starting wars is the prerogative of old men, the young go into battle to die. Soldiers aged 21-24 were WW-1’s biggest cohort. In WW-2, 42% of soldiers were aged less than 20. The tragedy of war is, first of all, the tragedy of young men. They are led to the slaughter in the name of glory and duty.Nobody returns unscathed. Those who escape death or physical mutilation bear psychological scars for life. In the US, 30,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have died by suicide — as against 7,057 killed in action.Drug addiction is rampant among combat veterans now as it was during the Vietnam war. When Nixon was asked in ’71 about US troops’ heroin addiction — 10-15% incidence — he dismissed the report. But he was 58, while 61% of the soldiers who died fighting were younger than 21. NYT’s Anthony Lewis summed up the problem thus: “They are fighting for a cause they do not understandand do not believe in, by methods that are cruel and in some cases criminal. ”In War and Peace, Tolstoy says: “If everyone fought for their own convictions there would be no war.” But young men have to fight for the convictions — cynicism, rather — of men too old to fight themselves. So, when New York University professor Scott Galloway points out that 51% of Americans aged 18-24 “believe the Hamas attacks of Oct 7 can be justified by the grievances of the Palestinians”, the establishment should wake up and listen.After Kennedy’s Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 — which almost triggered nuclear war — writer Walter Lippmann famously said, “I don’t think old men ought to promote wars for young men to fight.” His prescription for them was “to try as best as they can… to avert what would be an absolutely irreparable calamity for the world”. And the biggest calamity today is lack of opportunity for youth. What Galloway calls the broken social contract: “Today’s 25-year-olds make less than their parents and grandparents did at the same age… the statistics on children’s and young adults’ well-being are staggering. ” Dropping GBU-57s won’t blow them away.","Life expectancy has increased everywhere since then, and so have the ages of the lead figures in today's wars. Hitler was 50 when he started WW-2 in 1939 – a ripe old age when Germany’s average life expectancy was 61. Ismail Haniyeh was 61 when he ordered the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel from the safety of Qatar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122239635,imgsize-79226,width-400,resizemode-4/122239635.jpg"

US President Donald Trump laid out an ambitious blueprint to mark America’s 250th year of independence, saying the festivities would stretch from this Fourth of July through to 2026 and reach what he called “extraordinary” levels.Posting on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump said he would begin the semiquincentennial build‑up by travelling to Iowa on Thursday, 3 July, for “a very special event, honouring our Great Country.” He noted that Iowa had voted for him “THREE TIMES” and promised a crowd‑pleasing evening devoted to farmers, small businesses and “our Brave Heroes who fought to keep us FREE.”Trump added that he would highlight achievements on trade, “especially as it relates to Farmers,” and urged supporters to RSVP for the Des Moines gathering, which he expected to draw a “BIG Crowd.”Beyond the Iowa kickoff, Trump said Americans could expect extensive pomp and circumstance under the America250 banner. According to details already listed on the America250 website, the programme included:Trump said the Fourth of July 2025 would serve as the ceremonial starting point for the two‑year celebration, with the individual initiatives unfolding across the country and culminating in the Washington events on 4 July 2026.","America's 250th birthday celebrations will take place on July 4, 2026.

Russia will 'not back down' to solve conflict's 'root causes'



'We haven't fully stopped supply': Trump







US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that he hadn't made any progress regarding a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict following his telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.When questioned about his discussion with Putin, Trump confirmed to journalists, ""No, I didn't make any progress with him today at all.""Trump elaborated on the conversation, stating, ""We had a call. It was a pretty long call. We talked about a lot of things, including Iran, and we also talked about, as you know, the war with Ukraine. And I'm not happy about that, I'm not happy.""""We had a call. It was a pretty long call. We talked about a lot of things, including Iran. We also talked about the war with Ukraine. I am not happy about that... No, I didn't make any progress with him (Russian President Putin) today..."" he said in brief comments at an air base outside Washington, before departing for a campaign-style event in Iowa.According to Putin's aide Yury Ushakov's summary, the leaders engaged in a ""frank and substantive"" discussion. Whilst Trump suggested an immediate ceasefire in Russia's Ukrainian campaign, Putin declined.Ushakov noted that Putin affirmed Russia's commitment to its objectives in the conflict, whilst remaining open to resolving the situation through diplomatic channels.""Our president said that Russia will pursue its goals, specifically addressing the root causes that led to the current situation, and will not back down from these objectives,"" Ushakov said.During an extensive, 60-minute conversation centred on the Ukrainian conflict and Middle Eastern developments, Trump reiterated his position on seeking an early conclusion to the military operations in Ukraine. This marked the sixth communication between Putin and Trump this year.""Trump once again emphasized the need to end military hostilities as soon as possible. Vladimir Putin noted that Russia continues to seek a politically negotiated solution to the conflict,"" Ushakov added.The Kremlin indicated that Putin updated Trump regarding the progress of agreements between Russia and Ukraine from the previous month, concerning prisoner of war exchanges and deceased military personnel. Putin expressed Russia's openness to re-engage in discussions with Kyiv.Ushakov stated that their president reaffirmed Russia's determination to accomplish its established objectives, particularly addressing the underlying causes of the present confrontation, maintaining an unwavering position on these aims.This communication occurred while Russia intensified its unmanned aerial vehicle and missile attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks and the US has paused shipments of certain critical weapons to Ukraine due to low stockpiles.Trump addressed reporters while departing for Iowa, stating ""we haven't"" fully stopped the weapons supply, while criticising Joe Biden for allegedly depleting American defence resources through excessive weapons transfers.""We're giving weapons, but we've given so many weapons. But we are giving weapons. And we're working with them and trying to help them, but we haven't. You know, Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves,"" he remarked.This exchange of diplomatic statements emerges amidst reports that the US has temporarily halted deliveries of specific crucial weapons to Ukraine, as sources informed Reuters. This pause occurs at a critical moment when Ukraine confronts a Russian summer offensive and faces growing attacks on civilian areas.","US President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover, following Moscow's decision to remove the group from its banned organisations list on Thursday.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed receiving credentials from Afghanistan's new Ambassador Gul Hassan Hassan.The foreign ministry stated that recognising the Afghan government would enhance ""productive bilateral cooperation, AP reported.The Afghan foreign ministry called it a historic step, with Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating it sets ""a good example for other countries.""The Taliban assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021 after US and NATO forces withdrew.

Generational Damage

Easy Targets, Innocent Recruits

Burden Of War

Liberating Women





In some places, they’re called the Children of Agent Orange. Not in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia, but in the US. It wasn’t only American troops who returned who fell sick. Their children had odd birth defects — missing or extra limbs. For decades, any link was denied. Then more was revealed. Neurological conditions, gastrointestinal issues, spina bifida. Ravages of war didn’t spare soldiers’ families.As epigenetics grows, scepticism over a link between Agent Orange and generational disability is reducing. There’s some recognition that what a young soldier had to do in the faraway fields of Laos 50 years ago could today be harming his grandchild. A 2016 ProPublica investigation reported, “The odds of having a child born with birth defects during or after the war were more than a third higher for veterans who say they handled, sprayed or were directly sprayed with Agent Orange than for veterans who say they weren’t exposed or weren’t sure. ” Has anything come of it? Not yet.The world’s most powerful country, inured to its own gun violence culture, ignores the impact on American children at home when Washington wages war in the eastern hemisphere.Such denial to what war visits on children is evident in every conflict. Palestinian children in food queues bombed, Ukrainian kids held by Russia on the pretext of “rescue”, guns pushed into the hands of 10-year-olds dehumanised as tools of battle are atrocities sheltered under the umbrella of Collateral Damage.Unicef estimates that 50,000 children in Gaza have been killed or injured since Oct 2023. Kyiv estimates 20,000 Ukrainian children were taken away by Russia. There is no accountability anywhere. There is no paucity of data either on child recruitment in Sudan’s Darfur — an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 children have been recruited by govt paramilitary group RSF since 2023.When children are a blind spot, it should be no surprise that the well-documented impact on women is just as ignored. Every day, 500 women and girls in war-torn countries die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Bombed hospitals mean no access to maternal care for pregnant women.It’s women who must fend for children and elders in bombed quarters with resources and supplies running low. Also tucked under Collateral Damage. Rape as a weapon of war was once seen as a ‘wrong’ but, fact is, it is normalised. As wars find ways to extend in time and expand by area, there’s nothing to stop soldiers from targeting women, even little girls.Regressive regimes like the Taliban, and most orthodox rulers, show their writ through subjugation of women. Far too many wars are underpinned by a western ambition to ‘liberate’ women — the status of women in a country is invariably a factor that drives ‘regime change’ activity.Take Afghanistan alone. British, Russian, American wars found cheerleaders who backed their battles for a “brighter future for women’s rights”. But as Al Jazeera noted, “If Western wars ‘liberate’ Eastern women, Muslim women would be the most ‘liberated’ in the world. They are not, and will not be, especially when liberty is associated with Western hegemony.” Today, the world has neatly abandoned Afghanistan’s women. They still bear the burden of war.","Unicef estimates that 50,000 children in Gaza have been killed or injured since Oct 2023. 500 women and girls in war-torn countries die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth.

Ukraine: A Deeply Cultural War

The Othering

Some Hope?





Art and culture are both among the first casualties of war. Conflict not only makes people more parochial, it also breeds myths and misconceptions. It damages the soul and impedes evolution of the human spirit and mind. Artists and their works are victims of this destructive process. But so too are ordinary people, cities, places and shared cultural history.Many believe that the ongoing war in Ukraine is not just about territory but also about culture. That Russia is trying to erase Ukraine’s identity. There’s some evidence to show that Moscow has been targeting Ukrainian cultural elements. More than 1,000 Ukrainian heritage sites have been damaged and destroyed during the war. But this destruction is also a self-inflicted wound for Russian society itself.Before the war began in 2014 — the fullscale war commenced in 2022 — there was much intermingling between Ukrainian and Russian cultures. Russian language was spoken by many Ukrainian families due to the legacy of the Soviet Union, and joint cultural collaborations and projects were routine.In fact, Zelensky, who was formerly an actor and comedian, used to regularly perform in Russia, in Russian.In his early years as a comedian, he would take part in the biggest comedy competition in the Russian-speaking world called the KVN championships. It was the most influential cultural product coming out of Russia, connecting all the former Soviet republics. But war has severed all those connections today. And Zelensky, like many of his countrymen, no longer speaks Russian.War weaponises differences while deliberately ignoring shared experiences and enriched intermingling. Moses Maimonides was a 12th century Jewish philosopher, considered one of the greatest Jewish intellectuals of all time. He even rose to be the court physician of Sultan Saladin. His seminal work, Mishneh Torah, a 14-volume text on Jewish law, would not have been possible without Arab-Muslim interpretations of Aristotle and Plato. For logic, he relied on Arab scholar Al-Farabi.Yet, today this shared history between Jews and Muslims is largely forgotten in the din of conflict. Narratives have gained ground that sees Jews and Arab-Muslims as separate people, without any shared constructive history.Even sectarian conflicts within a religion can lead to extreme othering. During the civil war in Iraq in the last decade, a common myth among Sunnis, incredibly, was that Shias have ‘tails’. This othering completely ignores the fact that Shias and Sunnis have lived together for centuries, contributing to each other’s cultural and material life. The same is true for North and South Korea, where years of conflict and separation are witnessing the common Korean language diverge.But thanks to the internet, during recent conflicts, people from warring countries like Israel and Iran have been connecting via online platforms to engage outside govt communications. This raises hope that online connectivity can mitigate cultural schisms wrought by conflict. But with govts acquiring tools to ‘guide’ online discourse, this window can also be shut, locking societies into reductive silos.","Many believe that the ongoing war in Ukraine is not just about territory but also about culture.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made a critical call on Tuesday, casting a vote for President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill.For much of the all‑night session, Senate Minority Whip John Thune was uncertain whether he could secure Murkowski’s support. The Alaska senator spent hours in public and private discussions, pressing colleagues to soften provisions she said would burden her state’s most vulnerable residents.Murkowski at the end provided the 50th Republican “yea”, paving the way for Vice‑President JD Vance to break the tie and pass the measure 51‑50.Three Republicans—Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky—joined all Democrats in opposing the bill.“I advocated for my state’s interests, and I will make no excuses for doing that,” Murkowski told reporters just after the vote. “Do I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests.”Her support was unsure after the Senate parliamentarian struck down two attempts to boost Medicaid payments for Alaska and Hawaii, ruling they violated reconciliation rules.

US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani during his speech at the America250 rally held at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday evening.Speaking to a large crowd gathered to kick off a yearlong celebration of the United States’ 250th anniversary, Trump branded Mamdani a “communist at the highest level”.He accused Mamdani of wanting to “destroy New York.” “I love New York, and we’re not going to let him do that,” he said. Trump went on to call Mamdani’s campaign part of a broader ideological threat, stating, “Generations of Americans before us did not shed their blood only so that we could surrender our country to Marxist lunatics on the eve of our 250th year.”Trump proclaimed, “As president of the United States, I’m proclaiming here and now that America is never going to be communist in any way, shape, form, and that includes New York City.”In a recent press conference, Trump again called Mamdani New York City’s Democratic mayoral candidate a “communist” and a “nut job” vowing to block federal funds if Mamdani doesn’t “do the right thing.”“He’s a communist. The last thing we need is a communist,” Trump said, adding, “I think I’m going to have a lot of fun watching him because he has to come right through this building to get his money.”Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and state Assembly member, had earlier denied the claims on NBC’s Meet the Press, saying, “No, I am not [a communist]… Trump wants to distract from what I’m fighting for, working people he pretended to represent.”Also read | Trump targets Zohran Mamdani, vows to cut NYC funds if Democratic frontrunner becomes mayor","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani during his speech at the America250 rally held at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday evening.

Democrat sets record with 8.5-hr speech before vote on Trump bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrat-sets-record-with-8-5-hr-speech-before-vote-on-trump-bill/articleshow/122238586.cms,"(This is a Reuters story)





WASHINGTON: Hakeem Jeffries talked. And talked. And talked, as the top Democrat in the House of Representatives on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump's sweeping tax cut and spending bill in the longest speech in the chamber's history. Jeffries' speech, at 8 hours and 46 minutes, marked Democrats' last chance to prosecute their case against the $3.4 trillion package.Lacking the votes to defeat the measure in a chamber that Republicans control by a slim 220-212 margin, Jeffries, 54, railed against legislation that he characterised as a giveaway to the wealthy that would strip less affluent Americans of health nd food safety net benefits.""It's not the type of leadership that this country needs right now. But that's what we're getting Chaos. Cruelty. And corruption,"" he said. Jeffries began speaking at 4.53am ET and wrapped up at 1.38pm ET. That broke a 2021 House record sent by then-House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who spent 8 hours and 32 minutes lambasting Democratic President Biden's clean-energy and domestic-spending package.The House of Representatives launched a final yes-or-no vote after the speech.His speech also recalled that of another Democratic lawmaker, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who broke the record for the longest Senate speech in April with a 25-hour, five-minute attack on Trump's unilateral firings of federal workers. Booker's performance drew cheers from Democratic voters who have been frustrated by their party's powerlessness in Washington and have accused the party's leaders of being too meek.Jeffries used his status as Democratic leader to stretch his customary 60-second speaking time, known as a ""magic minute"", for several hours.That likely will not be enough to block passage of Trump's bill, which has already passed the Republican-controlled Senate. But Jeffries made clear he had his eye on a prize further down the road.Voters, Jeffries said, ""will get even"" in the Nov 2026 congressional elections ""because of these cuts being unleashed on the American people.""If Democrats win control of the House, Jeffries would be positioned to make history again by becoming the first Black House speaker in the Congress that convenes at the start of 2027.Early into his speech, Jeffries showcased sick children in Republicans' home districts who might eventually lose Medicaid coverage under the legislation. It was a maneuver that could increase coverage of his speech in local media across the country. Jeffries pulled no punches.He said the bill was ""ripping healthcare"" from Americans and called it ""shameful,"" ""disgusting"" and ""reckless."" ""This is a crime scene and House Democrats want no part of it,"" he said.","Hakeem Jeffries' speech, at 8 hours and 46 minutes, marked Democrats' last chance to prosecute their case against the $3.4 trillion package.

This week, the Capitol felt like a massive library packed with students pulling all-nighters before exams and for exhausted Republican lawmakers, the pressure was just as intense, if not more, since President Donald Trump was keeping a close eye on their every move.The final stage of Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill began Monday morning, with a marathon session of proposed amendments to the Senate version of the legislation. The process, known as a “vote-a-rama,” lasted for more than 24 hours.The process is typically a chance for the minority party to put the majority on the spot with tough political votes.This time, however, it allowed senate majority leader John Thune to work behind the scenes and address concerns from hesitant lawmakers. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina ultimately voted no, shortly after revealing he wouldn't run for reelection.In the early morning hours, senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrapped herself in a cozy blanket, while senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sported a zip-up hoodie on the typically formal senate floor.In contrast to Tillis, senator Lisa Murkowski, who had previously voiced concerns over the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and clean energy, ultimately switched to a “yes” vote on Tuesday morning.Her support helped move the bill forward, sending it back to the House for further debate and a final vote on the revisions.H ouse speaker Mike Johnson called lawmakers back to Washington right away, despite summer storms grounding flights. Some members resorted to renting vans and driving. Representative Nancy Mace shared her road trip on social media, making stops at Waffle House and Wawa while wearing pajamas.Moderate Republicans and hardline fiscal conservatives openly criticized the bill, pledging to vote “no” unless it was revised to meet their demands. Meanwhile, Trump slammed the dissenters onTruth Social, repeating his insistence that the House deliver the bill to him by July 4.Trump got his wish completed with a narrow vote on Thursday, but not before Democratic house minority leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a record-breaking, eight-hour-long speech on the house floor, condemning the bill as a “full-scale attack” on health care and social safety-net programs.","The final stage of Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill began Monday morning, with a marathon session of proposed amendments to the Senate version of the legislation.

"Won’t attack US: Iran says no plans to escalate, but will continue Uranium enrichment; open for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wont-attack-us-iran-says-no-plans-to-escalate-but-will-continue-uranium-enrichment-open-for-talks/articleshow/122235818.cms,"Donald Trump (left), Ayotollah Khamenie (AP)





Iran has no plans to further retaliate in response to the US strikes on its nuclear program last month, a senior government official told NBC News on Thursday, adding that the country is open to talks with Washington.However, deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Iran has no intention of stopping its uranium enrichment, confirming that the country will continue developing its nuclear program despite the recent attack.“We have already responded to that, as long as there is no act of aggression being perpetrated by the United States against us, we will not respond again,” Takht-Ravanchi said when asked if more was to come.After the US bombing, Iran fired missiles at the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. However, Qatari defenses stopped the attack, as Iran had given a warning ahead of time. This warning seemed to show that Iran was trying to ease tensions following a nearly two-week conflict with Israel that led to direct involvement from the US.President Donald Trump posting on Truth Social, responded in a similarly conciliatory after the Iranian strike,to thank Iran for the advance warning and saying that “they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system.’”Takht-Ravanchi voiced dismay over the missile exchanges while Iran was in talks with Trump about its nuclear program. Iran had been limiting its uranium enrichment under the 2015 nuclear agreement with the US, called the joint comprehensive plan of action, but that deal essentially collapsed in 2018 when Trump pulled the US out.“How can we trust the Americans? We want them to explain as to why they misled us, why they took such an egregious action against our people,” the deputy minister added.But he went on to add that his country would be open to talks.“We are for diplomacy and we are for dialogue,” Takht-Ravanchi said, adding ""but the US government needs to convince us that they are not going to use military force while we are negotiating. That is an essential element for our leadership to be in a position to decide about the future round of talks.”Iran has kept quiet about the real effects of the strikes, raising concerns that the attacks may have pushed its nuclear program deeper into secrecy.“The damage is serious,” Takht-Ravanchi said about the American attack, without elaborating further.Iran insists it is not seeking to build a nuclear bomb. As a member of the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), it has the right to enrich uranium for use in nuclear energy.“Our policy has not changed on enrichment,” Takht-Ravanchi reiterated to NBC. “Iran has every right to do enrichment within its territory. The only thing that we have to observe is not to go for militarization.”He also said that Iran is “ready to engage with others to talk about the scope, the level, the capacity of our enrichment program.”","Deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Iran has no intention of stopping its uranium enrichment.

He didn't shake hands: Angela Merkel calls Donald Trump attention-seeker; recalls incident from 2017,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-didnt-shake-hands-angela-merkel-calls-donald-trump-attention-seeker-recalls-incident-from-2017/articleshow/122235640.cms,"Donald Trump (left), Angela Merkel (ANI, AP)





Former German chancellor Angela Merkel called US President Donald Trump an attention-seeker, while speaking at an event organised by Greek newspaper Kathimerini in Athens on Wednesday.Merkel was attending an event to promote the Greek edition of her memoir “Freedom” when she recalled an incident from March 2017. At a meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, he refused to shake hands with her, an incident that took place off-camera, outside the main room.""I made the mistake of saying, 'Donald, we should shake hands,' and he didn't. He wanted to draw attention to himself. That’s what he wants: to distract and have everyone look at him,” Merkel said.""You can see this in what he is doing with the tariffs. Ultimately, he must deliver good results for the American people. He has to prove his abilities, at least to his own country,” she added.She went on to urge the European Union to stand up to Trump’s tariff threats and not be intimidated.“Europeans must stand united and not be intimidated when Trump imposes more tariffs on the bloc, but we should retaliate with tariffs of our own.”""I'm not saying we should break off relations with the US, but we must negotiate. Even the US cannot survive alone,” Merkel said, adding: “I see a problematic development.When Vice President Vance says, 'we are partners, and we will only support you if you agree with our concept of freedom,' which means no rules and no controls, that is indeed a threat to our democracy.""Merkel was at the helm of European affairs as the de-facto leader of the EU during Trump’s first Presidency, but the pair never had an easy rapport. Describing this often-strained equation, she wrote about Trump in her memoir: “He judged everything from the perspective of the property entrepreneur he had been before politics. Each property could only be allocated once. If he didn’t get it, someone else did. That was also how he looked at the world. ”“For him, all countries were in competition with each other, in which the success of one was the failure of the other; he did not believe that the prosperity of all could be increased through co-operation.”",Former German chancellor Angela Merkel called US President Donald Trump an attention-seeker.

"Pakistan assumes Security Council presidency: UN credibility at risk, says Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-assumes-security-council-presidency-un-credibility-at-risk-says-baloch-leader-hyrbyair-marri/articleshow/122227266.cms,"



Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July, calling it ""a profound affront to global human rights"" and a dangerous move that threatens global stability.In a post on X, Marri accused the UN of legitimising a state he described as built on oppression and deception. “When the accused are handed the gavel, international credibility erodes,” Marri said, warning that privilege has replaced accountability in global diplomacy.Referring to a recent statement by Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN on promoting peace and diplomacy, Marri called it ironic. “The very country preaching peace today has exported terrorism and jihad while practising religious persecution at home,” he stated.Marri cited Pakistan’s alleged historical record of human rights abuses, including its involvement in the killing of Afghans during decades of conflict, the 1971 genocide of Bengalis, and its role in the suppression of Palestinians during General Zia-ul-Haq’s tenure. “Then-Brigadier Zia allegedly murdered thousands of Palestinians in Jordan,” Marri said.He accused Pakistan of continuing its violent campaign against the Baloch people since annexing Balochistan in 1948, in what he described as a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.“Pakistan has forcefully killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of Baloch,” he said.Marri recalled key betrayals in Baloch history, including the imprisonment of Prince Abdul Kareem, the younger brother of the Khan of Kalat, who was jailed for 17 years after seeking negotiations, and the hanging of the sons of Nawab Nauroz Khan despite Pakistan's sworn assurance of safe talks. “Pakistan swore on the Quran to honour the talks, then publicly desecrated it twice,” Marri said.He further warned that Pakistan remains an artificial and militarised state, dominated by a Punjabi elite that suppresses minority national identities through enforced disappearances, torture, religious conversions, and extrajudicial killings.Marri concluded by urging the international community to reconsider its engagement with Pakistan. “Your decision lends moral sanction to a regime steeped in terror and oppression. Accountability must never yield to privilege,” he said, calling on democratic nations to revoke Pakistan’s UNSC presidency and recognise it as a rogue state.","Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July.
