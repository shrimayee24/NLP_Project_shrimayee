CHENNAI: Cyclone Ditwah, which weakened into a deep depression over Bay of Bengal on a breezy Sunday evening, surprised residents on Monday by unleashing one of the wettest mornings of the season.The cyclone, stripped of much of its cloud cover on Sunday, moved northward through the Bay of Bengal. It staged a resurgence overnight, amassing moisture. Drifting slowly northward at 5km/h and edging closer to the coast, the weather system thickened cloud cover over city and suburbs, setting off steady prolonged showers from 5am. It dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts Low-lying areas were flooded, children walked to school drenched, and traffic came to a crawl in most parts of the city. Around 10am, when most people were dodging potholes in traffic bottlenecks, India Meteorological Department reinstated an orange (very heavy rain) alert for the city and a red (extremely heavy rain) alert for Tiruvallur.Between 8.30am and 7.30pm, the city recorded “moderate” rainfall of 10cm, though it was heavy in some parts of North Chennai. Nungambakkam recorded 9.45cm, and Meenambakkam recorded 6.2cm. Ennore topped GCC records with 13cm of rain from 8:30am to 2pm, while Parry’s Corner, Ice House, Madhavaram, Saligramam, and Vadapalani each surpassed 10cm.On Sunday evening, when the cyclone weakened and the city was relatively dry, IMD withdrew the alert for Chennai to yellow (heavy rain) and Tiruvallur to orange. On Monday, weathermen said the system was likely to linger 30km-40km offshore along the coast and forecast heavy rain on Tuesday in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpet.Cyclone Ditwah’s path, however, continued to be a topic of debate. While IMD said the system would fade into a depression and cross land near Nellore early on Tuesday, independent forecasters said there would be scattered bursts in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet, and Kancheepuram. Blogger Pradeep John said he expected the clouds to regain as long as it was close to city coast. “The depression is going to stay for the next 36 hours near Chennai itself,” he said. Ditwah is neither able to move west nor east, he said. If this westerly trough influence moves away on Wednesday, then the cyclone will move west into TN or south AP coast into the land as a weakened cyclone, he said.","Cyclone Ditwah dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.

Sanchar Saathi App Optional Says Centre Amid Fierce Pegasus-Like Snooping Charges and Privacy Debate

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit back at the Congress after the opposition accused the government of infringing on citizens’ privacy by directing smartphone makers to preload the Sanchar Saathi app on new devices.Taking a jibe at the Congress, BJP MP and national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “I know who will delete it… 'Chor ki daadhi mein tinka' (a guilty conscience needs no accuser)""He also made a veiled reference to the National Herald case, in which Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are accused. “You know very well who they are. An FIR has also been filed against them. They have swindled Rs 5,000 crore. At present, they are out on bail,” he told reporters at the BJP headquarters, as reported by PTI.Defending the app, Patra said it is designed to protect users from fraud and crime, not to monitor them, and emphasised that people are free to remove it from their phones if they do not wish to use it.“The app cannot read your messages. It cannot listen to your calls, incoming or outgoing. Sanchar Saathi cannot reach or breach your personal data.” He added that the app helps provide security, check fraud, track stolen mobile phones, and return them to their owners.Minister of communications Jyotiraditya Scindia also,clarified that the app will remain dormant unless users register on it, and can be deleted at any time.Congress has alleged that the directive reflects a “dictatorial” approach, calling Sanchar Saathi a “snooping app” and demanding that the move be withdrawn. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of trying to “strangulate the voice of the people”.Responding sharply, Patra said, ""Mr Kharge, it is not meant to strangulate people's voice but to secure their voice, and their mobile phones, without which life is difficult today. We need to secure the device. That is why the government has brought this app.”“You keep on spreading misinformation. But people know how to move on,” he added, as quoted by PTI.","BJP hit back at the Congress after the opposition accused the government of infringing on citizens’ privacy.

Why Did Pakistan Navy Stay Out During Operation Sindoor: Indian Navy Chief Reveals Stunning Details

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Tuesday said that India’s third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon. Speaking ahead of Navy Day, he also explained how the Navy’s strong action during counterterror Operation Sindoor forced Pakistan’s naval forces to stay close to their coastline.Admiral Tripathi said, ""The aggressive posturing and immediate action during Operation Sindoor… forced Pakistan Navy to remain close to their ports or near the Makran coast."" He added that the operation is still ongoing.He also described how busy the Navy has been over the past year, completing 11,000 ship days and 50,000 flying hours since the last Navy Day. One Indian ship has been continuously deployed in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 for anti-piracy duties, and 138 ships have taken part so far, escorting more than 3,700 merchant vessels from different countries.Admiral Tripathi said the Navy has received international recognition, noting that one naval ship was praised by the International Maritime Organisation for rescuing nine crew members from an Omani vessel last year. He added, ""I also got a thank-you letter from the chief of the Oman Navy.""Vice Admiral K Swaminathan, head of the Western Naval Command, also highlighted the impact of Operation Sindoor, launched after the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.The operation destroyed nine major terror hubs in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and damaged key airbases.He said Operation Sindoor saw an unprecedented mobilisation of more than 30 ships and submarines in a short period. ""Our frontline ships were poised for combat off the Makran coast, under the umbrella of Vikrant Carrier Battle Group,"" he said.Swaminathan added that the Navy’s strong posture played a major role in Pakistan seeking a ceasefire, saying, ""The threat of offensive action by the Indian Navy could be considered one of the important factors in Pakistan requesting for a ceasefire.""",Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India's third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon.

His family has alleged that work-related stress caused the fatal collapse.His wife alleged that work-related stress led to the fatal collapse. The toll during SIR duty in Uttar Pradesh has now risen to nine in the past 11 days, including three suicides. Despite the rising toll, the chief electoral office of UP has not issued any formal response.Kamal Kant was an assistant teacher at a govt primary school in Nawali Lalpur under Sikandrao police station limits. He lost consciousness before leaving home and was declared dead at a hospital. His wife, Neelam Sharma, who was at her parents’ home, said, “My husband on the phone said to me that they are giving me tension and bothering me. I told him not to take tension.” DM Atu Vats and SP Chiranjeeb Nath Sinha visited the family.Vats said the body had been sent for post-mortem and the cause of death would be confirmed only after the report.“We received information at around 11am that a BLO, who was unwell, died on the way to the hospital. The entire team reached here. It appears that he had a previous medical condition.”Officials said Kant’s SIR performance was satisfactory and that he had already achieved over 50% of his assigned target. He had reportedly taken medication for low blood pressure earlier that morning before collapsing. The administration has announced a one-day salary contribution from officials and said efforts will be made to secure a contractual job for the wife.“Any govt employee or personnel is part of one large administrative family. It becomes our responsibility to stand with the family. We have decided to contribute one day’s salary. The contribution will be deposited into fixed deposits in the names of his four children. We will ensure the education of his three school-going children continues without disruption,” Vats said.He added that the wife, an intermediate pass, would be offered a job under compassionate appointment rules.","Kamal Kant was an assistant teacher at a govt primary school in Nawali Lalpur.

Confine your arguments to the legal issues (raised in your petition) to challenge the validity of SIR,” the bench said.Bhushan said SIR was a ruse for EC’s game plan to verify citizenship of residents in constituencies across country.He said citizenship is determined by a competent authority under ministry of home affairs and that EC has no role in this exercise.Earlier in the day, advocate Ashwini Kumar Uadhyay had alleged there were repeated instances of assault and use of criminal force to intimidate BLOs engaged in SIR work in Bengal and other states, and sought a direction from SC to allow EC to requisition the armed forces and state police for preparation of a correct voter list. The bench said, “EC and authorities are competent to take appropriate steps in this regard. ”Advocate Vrinda Grover mirrored advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for Congress general secretary K C Venugopal, TMC MP Mahua Moitra and other petitioners, that SIR was unconstitutional as EC is conducting it following a process which is neither prescribed under RP Act nor in the conduct of election rules.","‘Association for Democratic Reforms’ to argue within legal confines while challenging the validity of SIR of voter lists across states. ‘A lot of people see EC as a despot as it does not care for the statutory provisions, rules and regulations, and whimsically carries out whatever it feels to be appropriate’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125730698,imgsize-279710,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court-of-india.jpg"
Parliament truce: Govt agrees to SIR debate on Dec 9; Rijiju blames oppn for logjam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-truce-govt-agrees-to-sir-debate-on-dec-9-rijiju-blames-oppn-for-logjam/articleshow/125730374.cms,"No More Disruptions: Lok Sabha to Debate Electoral Reforms Next Week

Cong slams govt ‘arrogance’, Rijiju blames oppn for logjam

NEW DELHI: The govt Tuesday relented to opposition parties’ unanimous demand for a debate in Parliament on SIR, albeit under the broader subject of election reforms, as the two sides reached an agreement to rule out the grim prospect of another session washout.The govt prevailed on the opposition to first take up a discussion on Vande Mataram in Lok Sabha on Dec 8. The debate on election reforms will take place on Dec 9, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, adding that 10 hours each have been allotted for the two debates, with the possibility of extension. Sources said PM Narendra Modi is expected to initiate the special discussion on the 150th anniversary of India’s national song, an innate component of the governing BJP’s cultural agenda.Though the debate will be held under the anodyne head of “electoral reforms”, it will focus on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, pitting opposition’s “vote chori” charge against the governing side’s “protection of infiltrators for vote bank considerations” accusation.The breakthrough was reached at a meeting of floor leaders of all parties with Speaker Om Birla after the opposition’s disruptions to push its demand led to the adjournment of LS, like it did on Monday, the first day of Parliament’s winter sessionOpposition parties staged a walkout from Rajya Sabha after Kiren Rijiju conveyed the govt’s willingness for the discussion, but offered no timing and proposed that the Vande Mataram debate be taken up first.He said, “Vande Mataram is a matter related to our freedom struggle. Matters related to electoral reforms are also extremely important. Considering that opposition parties have united to raise one issue, the govt is ready to take up a discussion, but to have it before the discussion on Vande Mataram may not be appropriate.”Opposition MPs demanded prioritising the SIR debate as “people are dying”, with Leader of Opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge jabbing the govt by saying, “Vande Mataram comes from us not from them”. To this, RS chairman C P Radhakrishnan was quick to say, “Vande Mataram is for everyone”.As the deadlock was broken, Congress claimed a win, saying the govt’s arrogance had finally bowed to the unity of opposition parties. Its chief whip in Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore said, “One full monsoon session was washed out because of this. Two days of the winter session already wasted. Democracy is not a playground for diversion — it demands accountability.”Rijiju, however, blamed the opposition’s insistence on a debate on SIR for the logjam, insisting that the govt was always open to a discussion on a subject with wider scope. SIR is an administrative work of Election Commission, an autonomous body, that cannot be discussed in Parliament, but the legislature can always cover the agenda of election reforms, he told reporters.During its meetings with the govt as the winter session began, the opposition had proposed that a discussion can be taken up under any subject with wider dimensions that will allow it to speak on the ongoing SIR and the govt had agreed to consider its demand. The opposition is up in arms against the ongoing SIR in 12 states and UTs, including WB and TN where its constituents are in office and polls are due in the first half of 2026, alleging suicides by BLOs due to workload and irregularities aimed at deleting votes of targeted segments of population.The governing NDA’s morale has received a big boost after notching up a big win in Bihar. The Congress-RJD-Left coalition had strongly opposed SIR in its campaign before the polling was announced, with Rahul Gandhi leading a long yatra alleging a BJP-EC nexus for “vote chori”. However, it failed to draw much traction and the combine slumped to one of the worst losses a vanquished coalition has ever suffered in Bihar.","The govt prevailed on the opposition to first take up a discussion on Vande Mataram in Lok Sabha on Dec 8.

Defer Maharashtra civic pollsphase 1 results till Dec 21: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-halts-release-of-poll-results-for-maha-local-bodies-today/articleshow/125726930.cms,"PTI photo

NGAPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday restrained Maharashtra State Election Commission (SEC) from announcing the results of first phase of municipal council and nagar panchayat polls on Dec 3, a day after polling, on the grounds that it may “prematurely disclose public mood”, and influence the next round of voting scheduled for Dec 20.A division bench of Justices Anil Kilor and Rajnish Vyas ordered that entire counting process should be held only after the second phase, and all results must be announced together on Dec 21. The bench held that declaring the first phase results within 24 hours would compromise electoral fairness. “This may materially affect the results of polls on Dec 20. Then, it cannot be said elections on Dec 20 would be held in a fair and transparent manner,” it said.The court also prohibited publication or broadcast of exit poll outcomes till voting ends on Dec 20. The model code of conduct will be in force till combined results are declared, the bench further said.The order came while hearing three petitions — filed by Shakil Hamid Mansuri, Ashwini Burde and Sachin Chute — challenging SEC’s move to defer elections in certain civic bodies, where appeals are pending over acceptance or rejection of nomination papers.The petitioners argued that the revised schedule had fractured the uniformity of the electoral process and risked giving an unfair advantage to some candidates.Under the original programme, all municipal councils and nagar panchayats across Maharashtra were scheduled to vote on Dec 2. However, SEC last week postponed the polls in seats where appeals had been filed, saying it was necessary to provide a three-day period for withdrawal of nominations after disposal of appeals.While 264 nagar panchayats and municipal councils went to polls on Wednesday, voting in remaining 24 will take place on Dec 20.SEC told the court that while counting for local bodies with pending appeals would be held on Dec 21, results of the polls held on Tuesday will be announced on Dec 3, as originally scheduled.The bench firmly rejected the poll panel’s plan, saying that declaring results on Dec 3 would “affect the second-phase electorate”.", Bombay high court restrained Maharashtra State Election Commission (SEC) from announcing results of first phase of municipal council and nagar panchayat polls on Dec 3.

HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Tuesday addressed the executive meeting of the state Congress, highlighting the diversity within the party and drawing an analogy with Hindu religion.“The Congress takes along all types of individuals. One says he will worship Lord Venkateswara, another says he will worship Hanuman. When we could not bring consensus on gods, I don't think we can have consensus on political leaders and DCC presidents,” he said, according to news agency PTI.He further explained the variety of Hindu worship practices, saying, “How many gods are there for Hindus? Three crores? There is Hanuman for those who are not married. There is another god for those who marry twice. There are local deities where toddy and non-vegetarian food are served during certain events and there are gods worshipped by those who eat 'dal rice' (vegetarians).”The CM’s comments came amid reports of unease within the Congress over the appointment of new District Congress Committee (DCC) chiefs.BJP leaders in Telangana, including Union Ministers G Kishan Reddy and Bandi Sanjay Kumar, criticized the remarks.In a statement, Kishan Reddy said the chief minister, during the recent Jubilee Hills bypoll campaign, had stated that ""Congress means Muslims and Muslims mean Congress"".The CM appears to be making arrogant comments against Hindus and Hindu gods and goddesses because of his friendship with the AIMIM, he said.“The time has come for Hindus to unite in Telangana also. The time has come to show the power of Hindus to Revanth Reddy and Congress party,” he said.Sanjay Kumar added, “Hindu society should think now whether they want to face insults by remaining divided or show their power by ensuring unity.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

NABADWIP: A pack of stray dogs formed a ring around an abandoned newborn outside the toilet of a house in Nabadwip, protecting the mewling baby through the early hours of Monday. The four-legged guardians left the spot only after a local woman rescued the child at dawn.Residents of Swarupnagar Rail Colony in Nabadwip town, located around 10km from pilgrimage town Mayapur, heard the newborn's cries but most of them thought the cries were emanating from a house in the neighbourhood.At dawn, Radha Bhowmick was headed to the toilet when she spotted the infant surrounded by the dogs. She picked the newborn, a boy, and called out for assistance. Her niece-in-law Priti Bhowmick rushed the baby to Maheshganj Hospital. Later, the infant was transferred to Krishnanagar Sadar Hospital.Doctors reported no external injuries. There was blood on the baby's head, most likely from birth.Nabadwip cops suspect the newborn was abandoned shortly after delivery by a local. Police, along with Childline officials, have opened an investigation and have contacted the Child Welfare Committee for the child's long-term care.Bhowmick later remarked: ""Those dogs, the ones we often chase away, did what many humans wouldn't. They kept the baby alive.""There have been reports of similar acts by strays including one in Kolkata nine years ago when four dogs sat around a newborn girl, chased away crows, and guarded her until she was rescued.","A pack of stray dogs formed a ring around an abandoned newborn in Nabadwip, protecting the mewling baby through the early hours of Monday.

The vanishing rules of restraint





Washington’s outrage masks its long memory





The doctrine revealed









Frederick Forsyth has created many memorable protagonists, but Calvin Dexter from Avenger remains one of his most fascinating. Dexter, an ex–Tunnel Rat who crawled through the subterranean hellscape of Vietnam, eventually reinvented himself as a mercenary with a strangely unwavering commitment: he would go deep into hostile territory, extract a villain alive, and deliver him to an American courtroom. Dexter did not believe in summary execution or improvised vengeance. He believed in the symbolism of a fair trial, in an America that could demonstrate its moral superiority by forcing even its enemies to answer to the law.That ideal — the idea that America kills when it must but prosecutes when it can — stands in deliberate contrast to the way American foreign policy has often functioned in reality. For all its talk of a rules-based international order, the United States has long operated on a simpler formula: identify a threat, define the battlefield, and impose a solution. Dexter’s fictional insistence on due process is compelling precisely because it feels like the exception rather than the rule.Which brings us to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and the now-infamous “Kill Them All” directive. The mainstream American commentariat is working overtime to portray his alleged order — to eliminate the two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a bombed Caribbean vessel — as a shocking departure from established norms.But the truth is far less flattering. The Caribbean strike is not a fracture in American conduct. It is the logical expression of it. It is not an aberration. It is a revelation.Modern historians like to point to the Bill Clinton years, when cruise-missile strikes became the norm, citing the attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan. Some commentators even joke that some bombings helped iron out the rough edges that emerged post L’Affaire Lewinsky.But the United States entered the era of decisive, extraterritorial force long before Clinton ever signed a strike order. In the early twentieth century, under Theodore Roosevelt and the administrations that followed, American marines were dispatched across the Caribbean and Central America to enforce Washington’s conception of stability. Entire governments were unseated or reorganised according to geopolitical convenience, and the Monroe Doctrine became less a strategic principle and more a permission slip for action wherever America felt entitled.By the mid-century, American power took on a covert dimension. Dwight Eisenhower oversaw operations that toppled governments in Iran and Guatemala. John Kennedy authorised sabotage campaigns and clandestine strike missions. Lyndon Johnson escalated covert activity in Southeast Asia. These actions were always couched in noble language — containing communism, preserving order, promoting democracy — but they normalised the idea that the United States could choose its villains and neutralise them without ever seeing the inside of a courtroom.This longstanding tradition meant that when Clinton embraced precision strikes, when George W. Bush declared a global war on terror, and when Barack Obama turned targeted killing into a highly systematised bureaucratic machine, they weren’t inventing anything. They were refining a tool that had been honed for decades. Pete Hegseth is simply the first to wield it without bothering to hide the edges.From the 1990s onwards, American foreign policy adopted the sheen of surgical precision. Bill Clinton’s strikes were sold as carefully calibrated actions necessitated by global threats. George W. Bush then expanded America’s reach across continents, constructing the legal scaffolding for a war without recognised borders.Under Barack Obama, targeted killing became a streamlined process. Committees met, memos were drafted, and every strike carried the appearance of oversight — all while the fundamental principle remained unchanged: if the United States decides a person or organisation is a threat, lethal force may follow anywhere.Donald Trump’s first term stripped away much of the procedural varnish. Rules of engagement loosened, oversight narrowed, and operational discretion expanded. What earlier administrations whispered, Trump said aloud. And in his second term, Pete Hegseth inherited a system already primed for a harder, more unapologetic edge.The key shift in the Caribbean is the reclassification of suspected drug traffickers as quasi-military targets. For decades, boats ferrying narcotics were part of the law-enforcement domain. The US Coast Guard intercepted them, the Drug Enforcement Administration prosecuted the smugglers, and courts handled the rest.But when Hegseth and Donald Trump began describing these traffickers as “narco-terrorists,” the frame changed entirely. A criminal investigation became a counterterrorism operation. A maritime patrol zone became a battlefield. A person clinging to debris — unarmed, immobile, incapable of resistance — became a threat to be eliminated rather than a suspect to be detained.And this is where the Washington Post revelations become indispensable. According to officials familiar with the mission, US surveillance had tracked an eleven-man go-fast vessel off the coast of Trinidad, believed to be running narcotics for the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. When the first missile hit, the boat erupted into flames and the crew was scattered into the water.Two men survived, visibly wounded, clinging to the wreckage. It was at this moment, the Post reported, that Pete Hegseth issued the spoken order to “kill everybody.” The commander overseeing the strike relayed the directive, and SEAL Team 6 executed a follow-on attack that obliterated the survivors in the water. The Pentagon later tried to pass this off as an attempt to “remove maritime hazards,” but the reporting makes clear that this was not housekeeping; it was a deliberate act meant to ensure that no one lived to contradict the administration’s narrative of a clean, righteous hit against Venezuelan-linked narco-terrorists.But officials have pushed back sharply. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell rejected the allegations outright, calling the story “completely false.” The White House has since insisted that the follow-up strike was ordered not by Pete Hegseth but by Admiral Frank M. Bradley, and that it was “within his authority and the law,” according to press secretary Karoline LeavittInternational law insists that shipwrecked survivors be treated as protected individuals. American military doctrine, shaped over generations, echoes that view. Even during the fiercest years of the post-9/11 wars, wounded combatants were expected to be captured, not executed.Yet the logic that guided the Caribbean strike is unmistakable. Once someone is designated a threat, their status does not change simply because they are incapacitated. Vulnerability does not equate to innocence. Survival does not trigger rescue; it invites resolution. This worldview is not unique to Pete Hegseth. It is the natural consequence of decades in which the United States has equated security with preemption and legality with interpretation.Predictably, Washington reacted with indignation. Members of Congress demanded briefings. Commentators questioned legality. Editorial pages called for accountability. But beneath this ritualised shock lies a quiet truth: for decades, lawmakers turned a blind eye as the executive accumulated extraordinary power to designate, target and eliminate individuals far beyond US borders.The Caribbean incident is unsettling not because the United States killed suspected criminals — it has done so in various forms for generations — but because the order was so starkly expressed. It exposed a foreign-policy instinct that usually hides behind diplomatic grammar.Calvin Dexter is fiction because he represents the America that Washington likes to imagine itself to be — the America that captures, prosecutes and proves its moral superiority through due process. Pete Hegseth is reality because he represents the America that has quietly expanded its latitude to act without restraint.In the end, the most disturbing thing about the Caribbean strike is not that it happened but that it happened openly. Every administration before Pete Hegseth prepared the ground. They broadened the definitions, stretched the mandates and normalised the exceptions. Hegseth simply removed the curtain.The “Kill Them All” directive should not be read as a terrifying new innovation. It is the moment when America stopped pretending that its foreign-policy instincts are built on restraint. It is the moment when the façade cracked and the architecture underneath — the one constructed long before Clinton ever authorised a missile — finally became visible.Calvin Dexter’s world imagined an America that insists on trials even for enemies. Pete Hegseth’s world reflects the America that actually exists: one that prefers solutions that do not leave survivors to testify.","Donald Trump’s first term stripped away much of the procedural varnish.

Facing criminal charges in three countries and preaching about respecting law

The world literally runs on Indian doctors, Indian engineers, Indian founders, Indian scientists, Indian developers while you sit online performing your circus act.

Rather live amongst Indians than live with your hairline

Maybe if you followed the law as well as Indians do, you wouldn't be stuck in Romania facing human trafficking charges right now. Sit this one out, prisoner.

If Indians are everywhere, maybe the question is not “why are there so many Indians abroad,” but “why do so many countries rely on Indian labor, intelligence and entrepreneurship?” Presence follows demand.

Bro discovered Indians exist worldwide and had a meltdown

This was an unprovoked and unrelated post he made on Tuesday. Social media users slammed Tate for the remarks, reminding him of the criminal allegations he faces, including human trafficking charges and accusations of spreading propaganda through his online courses.Randomly, Tate said posted on X: ""Youre going to live amongst Indians if you live in Canada.

Trump-Maduro spat: US flights deporting migrants to Venezuela to continue despite claims of airspace closure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-maduro-spat-venezuela-to-continue-accepting-deported-migrants-move-despite-uss-airspace-closure-assertion/articleshow/125732625.cms,"



Venezuela on Tuesday said deportation flights operated by the United States would continue as scheduled, despite President Donald Trump recently asserting that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed. The announcement from President Nicolás Maduro’s government came after what it said was a formal request from the Trump administration to maintain the twice-weekly repatriation flights.The clarification reverses a statement made by Caracas over the weekend alleging that US immigration authorities had unilaterally halted the flights. Venezuela’s foreign ministry also made public an overflight and landing application filed on Monday by US-based Eastern Airlines seeking approval for a Boeing 777-200 service from Phoenix, Arizona, to Maiquetía International Airport on Wednesday.Venezuelan nationals have been steadily deported this year after Maduro, under pressure from Washington, dropped his long-standing policy of refusing to accept deportees. The government has framed the inflow - more than 13,000 people so far - as a “repatriation” from difficult conditions in US detention facilities. Charter flights operated by a US government contractor and by Venezuela’s state airline continue to land near Caracas, with the latest arriving Friday.The bilateral repatriation deal has been criticised by human rights groups, though Trump officials have said the flights form part of a broader strategy to weaken transnational criminal organisations. The flights have continued even as the US carries out targeted military strikes on vessels suspected of drug smuggling in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean waters off Venezuela.Officials say strikes and deportation flights together aim to disrupt groups such as Tren de Aragua, linked to violent crime and drug trafficking across the region. The Trump administration has also claimed that some drug cartels are backed by Maduro. On Tuesday, Trump suggested the US could soon carry out land-based strikes and hinted that countries beyond Venezuela could be targeted, mentioning Colombia.“You know, the land is much easier, much easier… We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too,” he said during a Cabinet meeting. Later clarifying, he said his remarks referred to producers of fentanyl or cocaine.“Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,” he said, adding, “Not just Venezuela.”The comments came as lawmakers from both parties called for inquiries into whether a recent follow-up strike on a suspected drug boat may have violated international law.","Venezuelan nationals have been steadily deported this year after Maduro, under pressure from Washington, dropped his long-standing policy of refusing to accept deportees.

'Kumar a criminal illegal; released into US under Biden': DHS

(With PTI inputs)





An Indian national who allegedly crossed into the US illegally three years ago has been charged with homicide after the semi-truck he was driving crashed into a car in Oregon, killing two people — the fourth such incident involving an Indian driver in recent months.Rajinder Kumar, 32, has been charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment. The victims — William Micah Carter, 25, and Jennifer Lynn Lower, 24 — were pronounced dead at the scene. Kumar, who was reportedly intoxicated, escaped uninjured.The crash occurred on November 24 in Deschutes County, Oregon. According to the Oregon State Police, officers responding to the scene found a freightliner truck and trailer “stopped in a jackknifed position, blocking both lanes of travel.” A car travelling at highway speed struck the trailer, which was positioned perpendicular to the road.Police said dark conditions and the absence of active emergency warning equipment were key factors in the collision, which shut down the highway for about seven hours during the investigation.The driver was arrested for criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangering. He has been lodged in the Deschutes County Jail.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described Rajinder Kumar as a “criminal illegal” from India, stating that he entered the US unlawfully through Lukeville, Arizona, on November 28, 2022.“Kumar was released into our country under the Biden administration and issued a commercial driver’s license by Gavin Newsom’s Department of Motor Vehicles. How many more senseless tragedies must take place before sanctuary politicians stop allowing illegal aliens to dangerously operate semi-trucks on America’s roads?” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, blaming California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom and former President Joe Biden, also a Democrat.The case is the latest in a series of fatal or serious crashes involving Indian nationals driving commercial trucks.In August, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which comes under DHS, lodged an arrest detainer for Harjinder Singh after he was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida. That same month, ICE arrested Partap Singh, accused of causing a multi-vehicle pileup in California that left five-year-old Dalilah Coleman with critical, life-altering injuries.In October, ICE issued a detainer for Jashanpreet Singh, who allegedly killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.","Rajinder Kumar, 32, has been charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment.

Allie Beth Stuckey pushes back on Candace Owens’ claim





Candace Owens made a strong claim about Charlie Kirk . She said Charlie Kirk was “betrayed” by people inside Turning Point USA. She wrote on X that she is “fully confident” about this. She also said she will soon share proof and name the people she thinks hurt him. Owens told people who gave money to Turning Point USA that they should ask for a refund because “leadership knew.”Charlie Kirk, who was a well-known American political activist, was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” talk at the campus when the shooting happened. After his death, Donald Trump said Charlie had once told him he might run for president one day.Owens’ new claim has brought a lot of attention because many people loved Charlie Kirk.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that any nation sending illegal drugs into the United States could face military strikes, prompting a sharp response from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused Washington of threatening his country’s sovereignty.Speaking to reporters during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump referred to cocaine shipments from Colombia and said, ""Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack."" The comments came as the administration continues missile strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, operations that have killed dozens in recent months.Petro responded on X with an invitation layered with a warning. He said Colombia destroys a drug-production laboratory every 40 minutes “without missiles” and urged Trump to witness the operations firsthand. “Come to Colombia, Mr. Trump, I invite you, so that you can participate in the destruction of the 9 laboratories we do daily to prevent cocaine from reaching the US,” he wrote.Petro added: “Without missiles, I have destroyed 18,400 laboratories during my government; come with me and I'll show you how they are destroyed, one laboratory every 40 minutes, but do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the Jaguar.Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war; do not damage two centuries of diplomatic relations.”He further said, “You have already slandered me; do not continue down that path. If there is a country that has helped stop thousands of tons of cocaine so that North Americans do not consume it, it is Colombia.”The exchange comes amid rising tensions in the region. The US military has increased its presence in the Caribbean as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro - whose country borders Colombia - of enabling drug flows into the United States. Maduro has denied the allegations. Trump has also recently suggested that US intervention in Venezuela remains possible.On Tuesday, Trump broadened his warning, saying countries other than Venezuela could also face US action. “I hear the country of Colombia is making cocaine, they have cocaine manufacturing plants, and then they sell us their cocaine,” he said.Petro, who has been sanctioned by the Trump administration, reiterated his caution in a second message: “Do not threaten our sovereignty, or you will awake the Jaguar… Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war.”",US President Donald Trump warned that any nation sending illegal drugs into the United States could face military strikes.

Trump's Shock New Threat Against Venezuela; Maduro On Alert? | 'WE'RE TAKING OUT SONS OF BITC**S'





Gavin Newsom on Wednesday shared a video from US President Donald Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting, claiming the 79-year-old leader appeared to nod off as senior officials briefed him on key issues, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In the clip circulated by the California governor, Trump can be seen sitting with his eyes narrowed and at times fully shut while his secretary of state speaks beside him about how “he is the only leader who can help end” Russia-Ukraine war.News portal People also reported that during the three-hour meeting, the president appeared to close his eyes for several seconds, including during commerce secretary Howard Lutnick’s remarks, before leaning forward again.The visuals drew attention as Trump had posted more than 160 times on Truth Social the previous night between 7pm (local time) and midnight and was active again before 6am People reported this alongside past observations highlighted by The New York Times about Trump’s reduced public schedule and moments when “his battery shows signs of wear,” as noted in a recent NYT report.The White House rejected suggestions that the president had dozed off.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to People: “President Trump was listening attentively and running the entire three-hour marathon cabinet meeting,” before reiterating a new administration line regarding Somali immigrants in Minnesota. She added: “Just go back and watch his amazing final answer in the press conference… This epic moment put an exclamation point on President Trump’s ninth Cabinet meeting of his second term. ”Last year, Trump similarly pushed back on reports that he had fallen asleep during his New York criminal trial, after multiple courtroom accounts - including one from The New York Times - described him with “his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.”He dismissed those descriptions, writing: “Contrary to the FAKE NEWS MEDIA, I don’t fall asleep during the Crooked DA’s Witch Hunt… I simply close my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes, listen intensely, and take it ALL in!!!”Trump has often mocked former president Joe Biden as “Sleepy Joe,” and last month criticised Biden again while images of Trump with closed eyes during an Oval Office announcement went viral. “He sleeps all the time… I’m not a sleeper,” Trump said at the time, while meeting Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.Amid questions about age and stamina, Trump recently pointed to a “PERFECT PHYSICAL EXAM AND A COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE TEST ('That was aced')” which he said he had taken recently, responding to NYT reporting on his routine.","Gavin Newsom shared a video from US President Donald Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting, claiming the 79-year-old leader appeared to nod off.

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan.

A fire on the roof of the Raleigh convention center was contained within an hour on Monday night after a natural gas incident sparked flames around 9.30pm, according to city of Raleigh officials. No injuries were reported.City spokeswoman Julia Milstead told WRAL that the blaze was restricted to the roof and did not spread into the building’s interior. Lights remained on inside the centre during the incident, and no nearby structures were affected, even as flames and smoke were visible across downtown.Milstead said security staff were inside when the fire broke out but were able to exit quickly. Around 50 firefighters responded, and operations began scaling down by 10.45pm, though crews were expected to remain at the site overnight. Residents were advised to avoid the area while work continued.Videos on social media show flames shooting from the rooftop minutes after the fire started. No events were underway at the time.Raleigh mayor Janet Cowell described the convention centre as an “important civic asset” and said officials would meet at City Hall on Tuesday for updates. “I hope we can repair damage and have it back functioning normally as soon as possible,” she said.According to the convention centre’s website, the North Carolina cybersecurity summit is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, followed by a holiday event on Friday.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticised Somali immigrants in the US, claiming they are too reliant on the social safety net and contribute little to the country. During a cabinet meeting, he referred to Somali immigrants as “garbage” and said they should be sent back.“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump said near the end of a lengthy Cabinet meeting, as cited by AP. “Their country is no good for a reason. Your country stinks and we don’t want them in our country.”Trump claimed that Somali immigrants “do nothing but complain” and argued that people coming from difficult circumstances who continue to complain are not wanted in the US.“These are people who do nothing but complain,” he said. “They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing … When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it,” Trump said.The Minneapolis–St. Paul metro area, home to most Somali residents, will see intensified deportation efforts this week, targeting primarily those with final removal orders. The operation will deploy “strike teams” of ICE agents and other federal officers, including about 100 agents brought in from across the country, as reported by the New York Times.The move follows several years of fraud cases involving dozens of Somali residents, whom prosecutors allege “lied to the state to receive reimbursements for meal disbursements, medical care, housing and autism services.” The Trump administration had previously threatened to revoke temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, describing the state as a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”Trump has also long criticised Rep Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat who emigrated from Somalia as a child in 1995.Last week, he intensified his attacks on Somali immigrants on social media after conservative activist Christopher Rufo published unverified claims in City Journal, citing unnamed sources that alleged money stolen from Minnesota programs had been sent to al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked militant group controlling parts of Somalia.“We can go one way or the other, and we’re going to go the wrong way, if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Trump said, as cited by AP. “Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage.""On Tuesday, Omar responded to Trump on social media, saying, “his obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.”Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, with over 61,000 people of Somali ancestry among the state’s roughly 5.7 million residents, according to census data.Somalis have been arriving in the US steadily since the early 1990s, often as refugees fleeing the country’s civil war. Many were drawn to Minnesota because of the state’s social services and welfare programs, which eased resettlement, and because of the growing Somali diaspora already established there, as cited by The Time.","US President Donald Trump called Somali immigrants in the US ""garbage"" He said they are too reliant on the social safety net and contribute little to the country.

Trump's 'PACK YOUR BAGS' Ultimatum To Putin Ally Maduro? US Senator Drops 'Russia Exit' Bombshell





Russia and the United States made no progress toward a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine after a five-hour meeting between President Vladimir Putin and two envoys sent by Donald Trump, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Putin met late Tuesday with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the sides only reviewed the broad outlines of US proposals and did not reach any compromises or agree on holding a new Putin–Trump summit, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.""The discussion was very useful, constructive and very substantive and lasted for not five minutes but five hours,"" Ushakov said, as cited by the New York Times.During the meeting, Putin reviewed the US proposals outlined in four documents sent to the Kremlin ahead of the talks.""We could agree on some things, and the president confirmed this to his interlocutors,"" Ushakov said. ""Other things provoked criticism, and the president also made no secret of our critical and even negative attitude toward a number of proposals. But the main thing is that a very useful discussion took place.""Ushakov said Putin conveyed “a series of important signals” and personal greetings to Trump during the talks, though both sides agreed not to reveal specifics to the media.He also confirmed that the discussions touched on the “territorial problem”, the Kremlin’s term for Russia’s claims over the entire Donbas region. Ukraine, however, continues to control roughly 5,000 square kilometres of the territory that Russia says is its own, and nearly all countries recognise Donbas as part of Ukraine.""But there’s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and in Moscow. That’s what’s been agreed upon. And contacts will continue,” Ushakov said.A 28-point US peace proposal unveiled last month faced criticism from Ukraine and several European governments for leaning too heavily toward Moscow. US officials later said some elements had been adjusted after feedback from Kyiv and European partners.Ahead of Tuesday’s talks, Putin struck a hardline tone, saying Russia would continue to push forward on the battlefield and portraying Ukraine’s leadership as weakened. Shortly before meeting Witkoff at the Kremlin, he insisted Russia did not seek a war with Europe but warned that if one began, it would “end so swiftly” that no one would remain for Moscow to negotiate with.He also threatened to cut off Ukraine’s access to the sea in retaliation for drone attacks on tankers from Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the remarks highlighted that Putin was not prepared to end the war, as cited by Reuters.Trump’s peace plan calls on Europe to shoulder most of the financing and security guarantees for a postwar Ukraine, even though European governments were not consulted during its initial drafting.""Our people are over in Russia right now to see if we can get it settled. Not an easy situation, let me tell you. What a mess,"" Trump said in Washington on Tuesday.",Putin met late Tuesday with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in- law Jared Kushner.

‘Null and void’: Trump declares all Biden autopen-signed documents invalid; calls them ‘unauthorized’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/null-and-void-trump-declares-all-biden-autopen-signed-documents-invalid-calls-them-unauthorized/articleshow/125731145.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday declared that all official documents signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen were “null, void, and of no further force or effect. ” In a post on Truth Social, Trump said any such document - ranging from executive orders to pardons - would no longer be recognised by his administration.The autopen, a long-used device in Washington that reproduces a leader’s signature, has been employed by multiple Democratic and Republican presidents. Trump, however, argued that Biden’s use of it was “unauthorized.”“Any and all Documents, Proclamations, Executive Orders, Memorandums, or Contracts, signed by Order of the now infamous and unauthorized 'AUTOPEN,' within the Administration of Joseph R Biden Jr, are hereby null, void, and of no further force or effect,” Trump wrote.He added, “Anyone receiving ‘Pardons,’ ‘Commutations,’ or any other Legal Document so signed, please be advised that said Document has been fully and completely terminated, and is of no Legal effect.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden, because of age and health concerns, relied excessively on aides and tools like the autopen. He has earlier suggested that staff made decisions without Biden’s full involvement.Biden - before leaving the Oval Office - issued a series of pre-emptive pardons for several family members and political figures. These pardons were described as intended to protect allies and top officials, including high-profile figures such as general Mark Milley, Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 committee.Family members, including Biden’s brothers James and Frank, his sister Valerie, and their spouses, were also listed as recipients of clemency in these accounts. These descriptions framed the pardons as a precautionary move ahead of Trump’s inauguration.Trump’s latest declaration appears to be aimed at sweeping aside any documents from Biden’s presidency that carried an autopen signature, potentially setting up legal and political challenges over the validity of measures taken in the final stretch of the previous administration.","US President Donald Trump declared that all official documents signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen were “null, void, and of no further force or effect” In a post on Truth Social, Trump said any such document - ranging from executive orders to pardons - would no longer be recognised by his administration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125731347,imgsize-1080701,width-400,resizemode-4/joe-biden-left-donald-trump-ap.jpg"
"MAGA ally pushes to end dual citizenship, not realising Melania and Barron Trump would be caught in the crossfire",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-ally-pushes-to-end-dual-citizenship-not-realising-melania-and-barron-trump-would-be-caught-in-the-crossfire/articleshow/125727781.cms,"About Melania's citizenship

What is the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025?





A Republican senator tried to end dual citizenship, but somehow placed Melania Trump and her son Barron in the firing line.Both the first lady and the president’s youngest child got into a debate that was not meant to involve them.MAGA ally Bernie Moreno of Ohio is preparing to introduce legislation that would require all Americans to declare an exclusive allegiance to the United States.His proposal is called the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025. It aims to abolish dual nationality entirely.However, the senator did not realise that the change would affect Melania and Barron, who both hold Slovenian and American citizenship.Moreno was born in Colombia and has since renounced his Colombian nationality. He has framed the proposal as a matter of loyalty.Speaking to Fox News, he said becoming a citizen had been a defining moment in his life. “One of the greatest honours of my life was when I became an American citizen at 18, the first opportunity I could do so,” he said. “It was an honour to pledge an Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America and only to the United States of America. Being an American citizen is an honour and a privilege and if you want to be an American, it’s all or nothing.It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.”Melania was born in Slovenia and naturalised as a United States citizen in 2006. She remains the only first lady to have done so. In her 2024 book The Art of Her Deal, journalist Mary Jordan reported that both Melania and Barron have kept their Slovenian passports, reports the Daily Beast. Jordan explained that Melania had filed the necessary paperwork herself because Barron did not receive Slovenian citizenship automatically. “She did that to give her son options,” Jordan said. She added that a Slovenian passport made it easier for him to work, study and inherit property in Europe.Under Moreno’s plan, dual citizens would have one year to renounce any foreign nationality or lose their American citizenship. Enforcement would fall to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which would monitor dual nationals using a new tracking system.Currently, Americans can hold more than one citizenship without being forced to choose. Moreno argues that this creates “conflicts of interest and divided loyalties.”","Bernie Moreno of Ohio is preparing to introduce legislation that would require all Americans to declare an exclusive allegiance to the United States.

Pop star Sabrina Carpenter publicly condemned a recent White House social‑media video that used her song 'Juno' to soundtrack footage of ICE arrests and deportation raids.Sabrina replied to the WH video on X and said: “this video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”The clip was shared earlier this week and begins with scenes of a protest and then switches to a montage of people being captured, restrained and handcuffed by ICE agents.

"Democracy, drugs or oil? Why Trump is gunning for Venezuela's Maduro",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democracy-drugs-or-oil-why-trump-is-gunning-for-venezuelas-maduro-explained/articleshow/125722026.cms,"A Caribbean Sea on Edge

Trump ‘CORNERS’ Putin, Xi, Khamenei-friendly Maduro; Venezuela Loses 2 Allies Before US Strikes Hard

A ‘drug war’ that doesn’t add up





A military footprint not seen in years





At least 10 US naval vessels patrolled the Caribbean, including guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

The USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, has been dispatched to the region.

B-52s and B-1 bombers conducted flights near Venezuelan airspace.

F-35 stealth jets, Reaper drones, P-8 Poseidon spy planes, and special-forces MH-6M helicopters have been spotted in Puerto Rico and around the Lesser Antilles.

Strikes that sparked regional alarm





Who was on board

What drugs were seized

Whether the vessels were armed

The real game: Intimidation, pressure, regime cracks





Signalling, not invading





Why Trump, Why Now?





1. Migration Politics

2. Crime and the ‘Tren de Aragua’ factor

3. A new Monroe doctrine moment

4. Political messaging to the base

The Barrel behind the Barrel of the gun





The CIA factor: Covert operations on the table





Airstrips and ports linked to trafficking

Military officers allegedly involved in cocaine smuggling

Key figures in Maduro’s security apparatus

Or, in an extreme case, a “smash and grab” attempt to snatch Maduro or his associates

Inside Maduro’s circle and a $50 Million bounty





What if Maduro falls? A bigger mess awaits



Possibility 1: A military takeover

Possibility 2: Hardline Chavistas seize power

Possibility 3: Fragmentation and civil war

Can the opposition step in? Not without the US staying for years





Edmundo González, whom the US says won the 2024 election

María Corina Machado, now a Nobel laureate, operating underground in Venezuela

US security guarantees

Rebuilding of the army

Unfreezing of Venezuelan funds

Security sector reform

Protection from colectivos and criminal groups

Why allies are nervous: Russia, China, Cuba and a wider spiral





The risks Trump faces at home



His base opposes long overseas entanglements

Opposition leaders are fractured and unreliable

Any US-backed transition would require enormous long-term investment

A failed attempt could entrench Maduro further

If he escalates:

He risks alienating voters who backed him on promises to avoid foreign wars.

A drawn-out engagement with no clear endgame.

Could trigger a refugee surge from Venezuela.

Risks hitting Russian, Cuban or Chinese interests.

If he backs down:

He looks weak after mobilising an armada.

Maduro emerges stronger.

Regional rivals mock US impotence.

So why is Trump gunning for maduro?



Pressure Maduro into exile without invading.

A migration flow he can campaign against and a criminal network he can label a national-security threat.

A chance to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Use migration and crime as political fuel

Keep military options open without committing to war

A geopolitical arena where Russia, China, Iran and Cuba are already embedded.

Most importantly, a dictator whose removal would hand Trump a legacy-defining victory - if it works.





On most days, the Caribbean is a postcard - the blue of the water melting into the horizon, waves lapping lazily against fishing boats, the sky an unbroken canvas. But for the last two months, this tranquillity has been shattered by the steady drone of US warplanes, the silhouette of warships stalking the sea, and the uneasy whispers of fishermen who know that the wrong vessel, at the wrong time, can now end in an airstrike.Since early September, more than 83 people have died in 21 US strikes on what Washington calls Venezuelan “drug boats.” The US has offered no names, no evidence, no contraband details, and insists this is “a war on narco-terrorism.” Yet the scale of the deployment - the largest US military show of force in the Caribbean in decades - suggests something far bigger is unfolding.Why is the same Donald Trump, who blasted “forever wars” and questioned America’s military presence in Europe and Asia, now assembling an armada on Venezuela’s doorstep? Why has he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in a country the US hasn’t invaded? Why are B-52 bombers performing “attack demonstrations” near Venezuelan shores?The short answer: the US wants Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro gone.The long answer is the story below.Behind the escalating confrontation sits a blunt political reality: Donald Trump now sees regime change in Caracas as both a strategic necessity and a political opportunity, even as he publicly denies pursuing it.When the Pentagon announced a strengthened anti-drug operation in the Caribbean, it cited threats from “narco-traffickers exploiting the Covid-era vulnerabilities.”But today, nearly five years later, the mission has morphed into something vastly more muscular.Washington maintains the operations are part of a counter-narcotics campaign. Trump has said that at least one vessel struck in October was “loaded up with mostly fentanyl.” But the numbers - and geography - don’t quite support that narrative.Fentanyl is overwhelmingly produced in Mexico, not South America. Venezuela is not a major cocaine producer either; the US DEA’s 2025 report attributes 84 per cent of cocaine seized in the US to Colombia, and does not list Venezuela as a significant source. Even the strike zones raise eyebrows: the early attacks came in the Caribbean, a comparatively minor trafficking corridor compared to Pacific routes.“It isn’t about drugs,” says Dr Christopher Sabatini, senior fellow at Chatham House, in comments to BBC. According to him, Trump has simply adopted the Venezuelan opposition’s description of Maduro’s government as a “criminal regime” to justify more aggressive action.The US Justice Department did accuse Maduro in 2020 of leading a “narco-terrorism organisation” - charges he denies. Known cases exist involving those close to him, such as the 2016 US conviction of two nephews of his wife for cocaine trafficking. But none of this fully explains the scale of the military build-up.Using satellite imagery, ship-tracking tools and open-source intelligence, BBC mapped out an American force that looks more like preparation for war than for drug interdiction. As of late October:Even former military analysts quoted by BBC admit: you don’t need an armada of this scale to catch drug boats.Since September, seven Venezuelan vessels have been destroyed by US firepower. Washington labels them “narco-boats,” yet hasn’t disclosed:Latin American governments - including Colombia - have criticised the US for “extrajudicial killings at sea.” Legal experts question whether America’s actions outside its waters meet international norms.But what troubles the region most is the unmistakable sense that something more than counternarcotics is underway.Experts largely agree on one assessment: the US escalation appears calculated to frighten Maduro’s inner circle, not trigger an outright invasion.“This is about regime change,” says Dr Sabatini. “They’re probably not going to invade - the hope is this is about signalling.”James B Story, former top US diplomat to Venezuela, told Politico Magazine that Washington now has “enough ‘exquisite assets’ on site that could overwhelm the air defenses of the country… potentially decapitate the government if that were a decision that he decided to take.”The strategy is, in essence, psychological warfare. The US hopes that generals and loyalists - many of whom face sanctions, indictments, or travel bans - will decide Maduro is no longer worth the risk.The timing is not accidental. Trump has consistently argued that Maduro’s “days are numbered,” and according to CNN, he has reviewed options for potential strikes inside Venezuela as part of “Operation Southern Spear,” which has deployed more than a dozen US warships.So why use the force now? There could be several motives convergence:Venezuela’s collapse has created one of the world’s largest refugee flows - nine million people. For Trump, migration is both a political rallying point and a justification for confronting the “root cause,” and as political ammunition.Trump routinely cites the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, calling it transnational. Washington alleges Maduro is tied to drug routes that channel Colombian cocaine through Venezuela into the Caribbean. While Venezuela isn’t a major producer, 5–15 per cent of Colombian cocaine moves through its territory, according to a former US diplomat under Trump’s first presidency. Though speaking to the Politico the experts caution, their interests only sometimes overlap.Some in Trump’s orbit openly frame Venezuela as a test of American supremacy in the hemisphere. In the US President's foreign policy universe, allowing a hostile authoritarian regime in the US backyard - one with ties to Russia, China, Cuba and Iran - is unacceptable. As former State Department official Elliott Abrams told CNN, if Trump backs down now, “there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk.”Trump campaigned on ending “forever wars.” Now he faces the paradox of threatening a new one. That’s why the administration insists publicly that this is not about ousting Maduro - while simultaneously making moves that clearly suggest the opposite.Even analysts who support the mission concede that “intercepting narcotics at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one,” as cited by BBC.If the military buildup in the Caribbean has raised questions, Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves - the largest in the world - have supplied an answer many in Caracas believe is obvious. Both foreign minister Yván Gil Pinto at the UN and President Nicolás Maduro in his letter to OPEC, earlier in the year have repeated the same thing: Washington’s pressure campaign is not about drugs, but about oil.Speaking at the UNGA, Pinto accused the US of unleashing “an illegal and completely immoral military threat” to pave the way for “external powers to rob Venezuela’s immeasurable oil and gas wealth.” He warned that the escalating strikes were designed to soften the country for foreign control of its resources.Maduro in his letter wrote to OPEC and OPEC+ nations that he was facing “growing and illegal threats” from Donald Trump, whom he accused of trying to “seize” Venezuela’s reserves. He asked fellow oil producers for support to “stop this aggression,” insisting that it endangered “the balance of the international energy market.”Caracas described Trump’s rhetoric about closing Venezuelan airspace, as further evidence of what Maduro’s government calls a “colonialist threat.” They also argue that Trump’s revived “drill, baby drill” agenda, along with new US plans to expand offshore drilling in California and Florida, show that Washington is positioning itself for a global energy push - and that Venezuela, despite sanctions that have throttled its own exports to just $4.05 billion in 2023, remains the biggest prize in the hemisphere.For Maduro, every US destroyer in the Caribbean and every warplane over its waters is not a counternarcotics tool - it is a reminder of a resource bounty that he believes others are prepared to fight for.Trump has publicly said he authorised the CIA to carry out covert action in Venezuela, though when asked if the agency had been instructed to “take out Maduro,” he replied that answering would be “ridiculous.”Ned Price, former CIA senior analyst, told BBC that covert action can include “information operations… sabotage… funding opposition parties… [or] the overthrow of a regime.”Analysts believe CIA operations could target:Dr Sabatini warns there are no major narcotics labs to “take out” inside Venezuela - so any strikes would hit military or government sites, escalating tensions dramatically.If US strategy depends on Maduro’s insiders flipping, why hasn’t anyone taken the bait? Because Venezuelan elites have much more to lose than to gain.The US has raised the bounty on Maduro to $50 million, and even that hasn’t moved insiders. “It’s nothing for Venezuela’s elites,” says Venezuelan law professor Jose Ignacio Hernández.Venezuela’s corruption networks are vast and lucrative. Former treasury chief Alejandro Andrade walked away with $1 billion in bribes before his arrest. For such elites, a $50 million reward for Maduro’s capture, barely moves the needle.Many generals and ministers fear that removing Maduro would expose their own criminal records. As Hernández puts it: “They will think, in some way or another, I am involved in criminal activities too.”Political scientist Michael Albertus of the University of Chicago notes that dictatorships maintain loyalty through paranoia: “Authoritarian leaders… create mechanisms for monitoring their inner circle.” Defection is not just betrayal - it is suicide.He told the BBC that even $500 million might not persuade Maduro’s top brass because authoritarian leaders “create mechanisms for monitoring them and ensuring loyalty.”Should Maduro die, flee, or be captured, experts warn Venezuela could slip into total chaos. There could be three scenarios:John Bolton told CNN that if Maduro were ousted, Venezuela’s cohesive military would likely “follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”Juan González told CNN: “Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo… someone else could usurp power.” This is the scenario that most worries foreign diplomats.A Western diplomat based in Venezuela told CNN: “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium.” Remove him, and “there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo.” Without him, rival factions - military, colectivos, criminal syndicates, Colombian insurgents - could carve up the country like a mineral-rich pie.Two main opposition figures stand in the wings:González, claims to have a “100-hour plan” to transition power. But experts say this is wishful at best. “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible,” warns Juan González. They would need:All of this implies 5-10 years of US commitment - politically toxic for Trump’s “no more wars” coalition.If US strikes were to hit assets connected to Russia, China, or Cuba, the conflict could widen quickly - even if none of these states would send troops. All three have deep investments, intelligence networks and advisers inside Venezuela.Meanwhile, Colombia - America’s closest regional ally - Its President Gustavo Petro has already accused the US of killing a Colombian citizen during one of the boat strikes. The diplomatic spat threatens intelligence sharing from Colombia - crucial for drug interdiction. This is significant because historically, Colombia has provided more actionable intel to the US than vice versa.Trump has hinted at the possibility of war with Venezuela, saying only: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.” But if he does escalate, the blowback could be severe:Yet Trump also faces a credibility dilemma. As Elliott Abrams warns: if he pulls back now, after building an “armada,” his tough-on-hemisphere rhetoric could ring hollow.Everything points to a multi-layered calculus. Because Venezuela sits at the intersection of every political, strategic and ideological battle that Trump wants to fight in his second term.Trump’s strategy is to create so much pressure - military, political, psychological - that someone within Chavismo concludes Maduro is too costly to keep.But whether this mix of deterrence and brinkmanship succeeds - or ends up dragging the US into an unwanted conflict - remains the defining question.","At least 10 US naval vessels patrolled the Caribbean, including guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.
