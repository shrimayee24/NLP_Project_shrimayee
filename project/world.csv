What China has to say?



Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek that took the markets by storm has been witnessing a crackdown by several governments, including India, US, Australia with South Korea being the most recent one.The countries have expressed a growing concern about the chatbot's security and data practices, especially on government devices.""We don't want to expose government systems to these applications,"" said Australian government cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.India has, however, prohibited the use of all AI tools and applications including ChatGPT and DeepSeek on government office computers and devices.The defense ministry announced on Thursday that it had blocked DeepSeek from accessing its internet-connected military computers.""Blocking measures for DeepSeek have been implemented specifically for military work-related PCs with Internet,"" Seoul's defence ministry told AFP.This move comes after the country's personal information protection commission (PIPC) requested the Chinese AI startup to provide clarity on its management of user information.The central government has prohibited its employees from using AI tools and applications such as DeepSeek and ChatGPT on office computers and devices citing ""risks for confidentiality of Govt, data and documents"".""It has been determined that AI tools and AI apps (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek etc) in the office computers and devices pose risks for confidentiality of Govt, data and documents,"" a government memo read.In not a ""symbolic move"", Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices following advice from security agencies. The decision was driven by concerns over privacy risks and potential malware threats posed by the Chinese AI program.""This is an action the government has taken on the advice of security agencies. It's absolutely not a symbolic move,"" said cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.""After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government,"" home affairs secretary said in statement.The American navy has restricted the use of DeepSeek ""for any work-related tasks or personal use.""Texas was the first state to ban the Chinese AI app. ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state’s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps,"" it said.Taiwan said that the government employees would be prohibited from using DeepSeek, citing concerns that the tool could expose sensitive data to Beijing.Taiwan’s ministry of digital affairs (MODA) has officially classified DeepSeek AI as a Chinese information and communications technology (ICT) product, warning that potential data leaks could pose a national security risk.As a result, MODA banned the use of DeepSeek across central and local government agencies, public schools, state-owned enterprises, and affiliated institutions. The restriction also applies to individuals working on critical infrastructure projects and employees of government-funded foundations.It was one the first countries to ban DeepSeek citing risk of data breach for millions of Italians.“The Authority, considering the potential high risk for the data of millions of people in Italy, has asked the two companies and their affiliates to confirm which personal data are collected, from which sources, for which purposes, what is the legal basis of the processing, and whether they are stored on servers located in China (translated from Italian),” an official press note said.China condemned the move, categorically highlighting its opposition to the ""politicization of economic, trade, and technological issues.""It criticised Australia for banning the Chinese AI app DeepSeek from government devices over security concerns.""The Chinese government... has never and will never require enterprises or individuals to illegally collect or store data,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.","China's AI chatbot DeepSeek that took the markets by storm has been witnessing a crackdown by several governments, including India, US, Australia with South Korea being the most recent one.

US plane with illegal Indian migrants lands in Amritsar: Why Trump is using expensive military planes for deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-plane-with-illegal-indian-migrants-lands-in-amritsar-why-trump-is-using-expensive-military-planes-for-deportation/articleshow/117946953.cms,"Poll What Do You Think Is the Most Effective Way to Prevent Illegal Immigration? Address the Root Causes of Migration Strengthen Border Security and Enforcement

NEW DELHI: A US military aircraft transporting 104 alleged illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar on Wednesday. The flight, which originated from San Antonio, Texas, included 30 deportees from Punjab, 33 each from Haryana and Gujarat, three each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh, as reported by news agency PTI citing sources.Footage showed a US military C-17 aircraft arriving at Shri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport around 1.30pm, shortly after which the deported Indian nationals disembarked.Th development comes as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up its aggressive stance on illegal immigration, with military planes now being used to deport illegal immigrants. The move, however, comes with a hefty price tag for American taxpayers.Military aircrafts, usually reserved for war zones and disaster relief, come with a significantly higher cost compared to the typical commercial charter flights used by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).According to Reuters, one of these military flights is estimated to cost at least $4,675 (Rs 4.07 lakh) per deportee, a figure that is more than five times the cost of a first-class ticket on a commercial airline. In comparison, ICE deportation flights cost a far more affordable (Rs 55,000 per person).As per Reuters, Acting ICE director Tae Johnson told lawmakers during an April 2023 budget hearing that deportation flights cost $17,000 (about Rs 15 lakh) per flight hour for 135 deportees and typically lasted five hours.”A C-17 transport aircraft, which is used for these missions, costs an eye-watering $28,500 (Rs 24,90,559) per hour to operate, with the India-bound flight exceeding 12 hours in duration. This puts the total cost of one such mission into the millions of dollars, but as a US defense official pointed out, the exact cost is still being calculated.The official added that despite the high price, the priority is to act swiftly following Trump’s national emergency declaration on illegal immigration.Trump’s decision to use military planes has also sparked controversy abroad. Some countries, like Colombia and Mexico, have refused to let US military aircraft land to drop off deported migrants, with Mexico asserting its sovereignty and calling for coordination rather than unilateral action.While the deportation costs are steep, Trump’s tough rhetoric on immigration seems to be driving the use of military aircraft. As he stated in a recent speech, the use of such planes sends a strong message to illegal immigrants and the world: if you enter the US illegally, there will be serious consequences.“For the first time in history, we are locating and loading illegal aliens into military aircraft and flying them back to the places from which they came…We’re respected again, after years of laughing at us like we’re stupid people,” Trump had said.India, meanwhile, has time and again reiterated its stance against illegal immigration. The Ministry of External Affairs on Friday had stated it will facilitate the return of Indian nationals ""overstaying"" or residing without proper documentation in the United States or ""anywhere in the world.""","A US military aircraft transporting 104 alleged illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar.

US Deports 200+ Illegal Indian Migrants Using Military Aircraft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-illegal-indian-migrants-in-military-aircraft/articleshow/117925897.cms,"Poll What Do You Think Is the Most Effective Way to Prevent Illegal Immigration? Address the Root Causes of Migration Strengthen Border Security and Enforcement

NEW DELHI: In the first such operation of its kind involving India since the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the US despatched a C17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal Indian migrants to India. Anonymous US officials were quoted as saying dozens had been deported, and unconfirmed reports put the number of deportees north of 200, but there was no confirmation about the same by either country.In fact, there was no official acknowledgement at all of the flight by Indian authorities till late in the evening. The American embassy here, without sharing any details about the flight, said the US is vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants. “These actions send a clear message: illegal migration is not worth the risk,” said the spokesperson.Official sources here said India’s position on illegal migration had not changed and it will continue to accept those who illegally entered the US, after verifying their Indian origin. The people who are returning, all verified Indian nationals, are among the thousands of Indians identified for deportation under the Biden administration.An early morning report by Reuters from Washington said the C-17 aircraft had departed for India with migrants aboard but would not arrive for at least 24 hours. The Punjab government was preparing for its landing in Amritsar on Wednesday morning. The Indian government did not confirm if the plane was going to land there but American journalists quoted US officials as saying that the aircraft was on its way to the Indian border city after a stop in Guam.The development also comes days ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US for his first bilateral meeting with Trump since the latter’s inauguration on January 20. Trump had raised the issue of illegal migration with Modi and later said the India PM would do what’s right on the issue.While India has been accepting illegal migrants from the US for years, including under the first Trump administration, it has rarely, if ever, used a military aircraft to deport Indian nationals to India. The last time US authorities deported a significant number of illegals to India was in October last year but that was carried out through a large frame charter flight. Colombia recently turned away 2 US military deportation aircraft, saying the US was treating its nationals like criminals, but quickly backed down after Trump threatened to retaliate with punitive trade tariffs.While India is unlikely to be as sensitive as some of the Leftist Latin American leaders about receiving citizens in a military aircraft from the US, a country it has robust defence cooperation with, the Indian government will closely follow how Indian nationals returning are handled by American authorities in deportation flights. This is also the farthest that a US deportation plane has travelled since Trump’s return as such flights were limited till now to central and South American countries. Many of these illegal migrants were reported to have landed in their respective countries in handcuffs. While Mexico has insisted on accepting its citizens only in civilian planes, Brazil complained about “flagrant disregard’’ of human rights in US deportation flights.A New York Times report on January 3, quoting defence officials, said military planes have rarely been used in the past by the US for deportation. Most deportations in the past couple of weeks have been through nonmilitary planes and only 6 military flights have been used for the same till the end of Trump’s second week in office. Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Peru are the only countries to have received military flights till the end of the last week.","The US despatched a C17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal Indian migrants to India.

Many countries became developed in 20-25 years and since we have democracy, demography and demand, we have to move on with this dream till 2047.""Rahul had Monday alleged that Modi sent external affairs minister S Jaishankar to the US to wangle an invite for inauguration of Donald Trump as US president as part of his larger narrative of incompetence against Modi govt. The PM did not respond to the specific charge which Jaishankar had already refuted but referred to J K Galbraith's recollection of first PM Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to the US during John F Kennedy's presidency, terming it as the ""worst state visit"".Galbraith was a close aide of former US president JFK and a renowned public servant who served as ambassador to India.""These days, people seek to talk about foreign policy. That is seen as a sign of maturity. Such people should read 'JFK's Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA and the Sino-Indian War'. Only then will you get to know what transpired under the cloak of diplomacy,"" Modi said, referring to details of Galbraith's unflattering account of Nehru's engagements in Washington DC as told to former US diplomat and CIA analyst Bruce Riedel.It was one of Modi's least-interrupted speeches in recent times in Lok Sabha as the entire opposition was in attendance and the speech concluded without any noticeable protests or objections by opposition parties.Modi, however, deployed his trademark blend of aggression and subtlety. He suggested that Rahul's claim to be a custodian of the interests of SCs/STs and OBCs did not square with the entitlements that came with his elite background. ""How many SCs/STs and OBCs have had three members simultaneously serving as MPs?"" he asked, alluding to Sonia and Priyanka also being MPs. He criticised Sonia for her ""poor thing"" remark about Murmu. ""After the President's address - a woman President, the daughter of a poor family - if you cannot respect her, it is up to you. But what all is being said to insult her? What is the reason?"" he said.The PM once again took on the allegation that BJP under him was out to subvert the Constitution. ""There are some people who are strutting around with copies of the Constitution stuffed in their pockets. But we are the ones who have internalised the Constitution and act accordingly,"" he said.In a not-so-veiled allusion to Congress' recent pitch for caste census, he said ""it has become a fashion for some leaders to talk of castes"".Modi invoked his own humble background to assert that when a person, who is connected to the ground, understands the ground reality and spends his life for the poor, then changes follow.""One who has lived that kind of life knows what it means to have a house with a proper roof. Pain of poor, troubles of common man cannot be understood just like that; it requires passion and some just don't have it,"" he said.","PM Modi accuses Rahul Gandhi of using ""the language of urban Naxals openly"" He also took exception to Rahul's remark terming Droupadi Murmu's speech unexciting.

Three new lawsuits in New York were filed against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs from individuals who have accused him of sexual assault. The music mogul, who is already awaiting trial for racketeering and sex trafficking charges, has denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty.One of the latest lawsuits, filed by an anonymous plaintiff identified as John Doe on Tuesday, accuses Combs of forced labour, human and sex trafficking, sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, and breach of contract.John Doe, a former aspiring musician and entertainer in Las Vegas, claims he was coerced into performing strip shows and engaging in sexual acts while under the influence due to “covert drugging.” Doe alleges that Combs raped him on multiple occasions and blackmailed him using footage from hidden cameras.In the lawsuit, John Doe describes an incident where Combs allegedly instructed him to apply baby oil during a performance. “After applying the baby oil, Plaintiff became unusually sleepy, disoriented, confused, exhausted, drowsy, weak, confused, sluggish, numb and alarmed by the sensation of being trapped in his own body,” the suit says, as per reports byandWhile in this state, Doe was allegedly instructed by Combs, as per the US Mirror report, to ""engage in acts such as masturbating and to engage in sexual contact with the woman present""John Doe, in the lawsuit, also claims that when he first met Combs in 2007, Doe was a ""premier"" figure in the Las Vegas adult entertainment scene. According to the lawsuit, Combs hired him through an agency for a strip show in Las Vegas and requested him on two other occasions. The lawsuit says that during these performances, Combs and other women were present, and Doe was given drinks that led him to feel disoriented and weak.The lawsuit claims that Combs used promises of career advancement to manipulate and exploit Doe, trapping him in a cycle of fear and abuse. Doe was hoping to pursue a music career and alleges that Combs took advantage of that.In addition to the John Doe lawsuit , two Jane Does filed separate lawsuits in New York County Supreme Court , claiming Combs sexually assaulted them in the 1990s.

Conflict in eastern DR

Congo

raises the spectre of the old Congo wars,

Ukraine

continues to endure Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure,

Trump

’s possible deal for

Kyiv

, a bizarre proposal for Gaza, and a halt to the looming trade war with Canada and Mexico. So let’s get to it:

War in eastern Congo:

Attacks on Ukraine:

Trump’s Ukraine deal?:

Bizarre solution for Gaza:

Rollback on Canada and Mexico:

Opening up old wounds, the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo escalated last week with the rebel group M23 capturing the city of Goma in the region. The conflict has its roots in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and subsequent Congo wars of 1996-97 and 1998-2000 that sucked in nine African nations and a plethora of militias fighting each other. The current Rwandan government – which seems to be backing M23, an ethnic Congolese Tutsi militia – accuses Congo of colluding with extremist Hutu militias to target the Tutsi community in Congo. Kigali also says that some of these Hutu extremists are linked to the 1994 genocide.Meanwhile, UNSC members US, France and UK believe that Rwandan military forces are operating alongside M23 inside eastern Congo. Plus, South Africa has accused Rwanda-backed M23 of killing its peacekeepers in Congo, and warned Kigali that further attacks would be treated as a declaration of war. But Kigali and M23 are undeterred. The latter’s fighters are continuing their advance in eastern Congo. UK and Germany have also threatened to halt aid to Rwanda over the conflict. But that is seemingly having no impact. Also, eastern Congo is very rich in minerals such as coltan which is used in making mobile phones and other electronics. In fact, the UN estimates that last year M23 rebels smuggled at least 150 metric tonnes of coltan into Rwanda. And that’s why Congo accuses Rwanda of trying to grab its land and minerals by proxy.But all of this also has echoes of the war in Ukraine. Russia since 2014 has used the pretext of protecting Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine to send troops into the Donbas. It illegally annexed Crimea – internationally recognised as Ukrainian territory – to exact revenge on the Ukrainian population for revolting against and throwing out erstwhile pro-Russia president Yanukovych who had reneged on Ukraine’s legal and promised integration plans with EU. And given that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is now about to mark three years, perhaps other countries are also getting similar subversive ideas.Russian attacks on Ukraine continued unabated last week with particularly devastating ones targeting Odessa, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia. Civilian infrastructure were hit in these attacks, including residential buildings and world heritage sites. In Poltava, a five-storey residential building saw a direct missile strike that led to the deaths of at least 14 people, including two children. One of those was nine-year-old Sophia. In Odessa, the historic city centre took heavy damage, including the 126-year-old Hotel Bristol. All of these constitute war crimes.Speaking of which, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has raised an alarm over a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces. A total of 79 such executions in 24 separate incidents have been recorded by the mission since the end of August 2024. In fact, Ukraine has recorded 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers being executed by Russian forces as of mid-December with 109 of them in 2024 itself. The international community must take note of these war crimes and crimes against humanity for genuine justice in Ukraine. Again, this war was foisted on Ukraine. It is Ukraine’s land that is being destroyed. Ukrainian homes are being turned to rubble. And Ukrainian children are losing their lives. The world cannot let this slide.Reports have surfaced that Trump apparently wants to do a deal whereby US will get access to Ukraine’s rare earths in lieu of aid. And Kyiv seems to be keen on this deal. In fact, this is part of the ‘Victory Plan’ that President Zelenskyy had discussed with Western partners. Rare earths are crucial for modern technology with varied applications in smartphones, computers, electric cars, renewable energy systems, etc. They also have much application in defence systems such as guidance systems, lasers, radars and sonars. But US has a problem. China holds the largest concentration of rare earths in the world, around 35% of global reserves. And with US and China locked in a strategic-security tussle, Washington would like nothing more than to get its hands on as much of rare earths as possible. Hence, a rare earths deal with Ukraine in exchange for American military aid would be a win-win in this situation, removing concerns around future supply of such aid for Kyiv, and giving Trump the justification he needs to show his political constituency to continue helping Ukraine. This would surely be a smart move on the part of both parties.Trump, however, returned to his shock-and-awe form with his latest pronouncement on Gaza by suggesting that the US obtain ownership of the Strip and redevelop the land, including with a resort. Speaking at a Press conference with visiting Israeli PM Netanyahu , Trump suggested that Gaza could then be some international hub with nationalities from all over the world. The jaw-dropping statement was quickly rejected by Saudi Arabia that said it wouldn’t normalise its relations with Israel unless it came with a guarantee for a Palestine state. Plus, there is practically no way in hell that Gazans are going to just meekly leave Gaza, no matter how destroyed the place is because of 15 months of conflict. Also, Hamas is very much alive and kicking in Gaza despite being battered during the conflict. So Trump’s bizarre plan won’t work.Again, it could all be part of Trump’s gambit to obtain leverage in future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump always starts high and then winds down to what is acceptable to him. But whatever his actual solution is for the Israel-Palestine conflict, US taking over Gaza can’t be part of it. Also, didn’t he say he wanted to keep the US out of foreign conflicts?In another example of how Trump negotiates, Trump paused the announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico after both countries agreed to strengthen their borders with the US. The threatened tariffs have been paused for 30 days after Canada and Mexico said they would deploy more resources to stop drug smuggling and illegal migration into the US. To be honest, the measures are not something new and are anyway part of an ongoing cooperative process that Canada and Mexico were undertaking with the previous US administration. But Trump gets to show to his political constituency that he has done something about drugs and migrants. Other countries who may be preparing for similar actions from Trump will be taking notes on how to pacify him.",The conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo escalated last week with the rebel group M23 capturing the city of Goma.

New directives for justice department



Bondi’s confirmation and political concerns



US attorney general Pam Bondi on Wednesday ordered a review of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump as part of a series of directives to change policies at the justice department. The review will examine cases involving special counsel Jack Smith, including charges brought against Trump, as well as prosecutions related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.Bondi, who was sworn in earlier in the day at the White House, announced the formation of a "" weaponization working group "" to investigate cases that may have been politically motivated. The memo outlining the group’s role reflects Trump’s long-standing claim that the justice department under President Joe Biden was used against conservatives.However, some of its investigations also focused on Biden and his son, and no evidence has shown that Trump’s prosecutions were politically motivated.Bondi signed 14 directives aimed at reversing policies from the Biden administration. Among these was an order to lift the moratorium on the federal death penalty and stop federal grants to jurisdictions that ""unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement.""The justice department will submit quarterly reports to the White House about the findings of the new review group. According to the memo, the group will look for cases where actions ""appear to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice.""In another directive, Bondi said that justice department lawyers must support administration policies in legal cases. Prosecutors who refuse to sign legal briefs or argue cases on behalf of the administration could face dismissal.Bondi’s appointment has raised concerns among some lawmakers about the independence of the justice department. Before becoming attorney general, Bondi was Florida’s attorney general and later defended Trump during his first impeachment trial.Democrats who opposed her nomination questioned whether she could separate her role from the White House’s political interests. During her confirmation hearing, Bondi said politics would not influence her decisions. However, she did not rule out investigations into Trump’s political opponents and repeated Trump’s claim that his prosecutions were politically motivated.“The justice department had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s got to stop,” Bondi said at the hearing.Despite its broad scope, the new working group will not have prosecutorial powers or the ability to issue subpoenas. The review will also not include investigations into Democrats that were conducted by Biden’s justice department, including probes into Biden’s handling of classified documents and his son Hunter Biden’s legal cases. Hunter Biden was convicted of felony gun and tax charges before being pardoned by his father in December.Trump’s legal cases and special counsel investigationJack Smith led the investigations into Trump’s handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Both cases led to criminal charges, but after Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, the indictments were dropped due to justice department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.Smith defended his work, saying that his team followed the law, not politics. “We stood up for the rule of law,” Smith said. In his final report to then-attorney general Merrick Garland, Smith wrote that the evidence was strong enough to convict Trump of attempting to overturn the 2020 election.Bondi took the oath of office at the White House, sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas with Trump present. It was the first time Trump participated in a second-term swearing-in of a Cabinet member, showing his direct involvement in the operations of the justice department.","Pam Bondi signs 14 directives aimed at reversing policies from the Biden administration.

Policy changes



US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to ban transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. ""From now on women’s sports will be only for women,"" Trump said before signing the order at the White House, where he was joined by children and female athletes. ""With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over.""Top Republicans, including US House speaker Mike Johnson and Congresswoman Marjorie Green, attended the signing ceremony. Trump said, ""We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls,"" which was met with applause.The order, titled ""Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,"" gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.The order allows US government agencies to cut funding to schools that permit transgender athletes to compete on women’s teams. ""If you let men take over women’s sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated and risk your federal funding,"" Trump said.Trump also said he would push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games. He stated that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been directed to tell the IOC, ""We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.""Additionally, Trump said he had ordered homeland security chief Kristi Noem to deny visas to individuals who, according to him, falsely identify as women athletes to enter the US for the Games.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order “upholds the promise of Title IX” and will mandate “immediate action, including enforcement actions” against schools and athletic associations that do not provide single-sex sports and locker rooms for women.The order was issued on National Girls and Women in Sports Day and is the latest in a series of executive actions by the Republican president focusing on transgender issues.Since returning to office, Trump has signed several orders related to gender identity. At his inauguration, he announced that US government policy would only recognize two genders, male and female, ending the option of a third gender in some settings.Shortly after, he signed an order removing what he called ""transgender ideology"" from the military, effectively banning transgender troops. Another order restricted gender transition procedures for individuals under 19.During the 2024 election campaign , Trump frequently criticized Democrats on transgender rights. He used the phrase, ""Kamala Harris is for they/them. President Trump is for you,"" referring to her support for transgender rights. He also brought up her previous support for gender reassignment procedures for prisoners.The executive order follows a bill passed in January by the Republican-led House of Representatives that restricted transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.As transgender people have gained more visibility in the US, discussions about gender and fairness in sports have increased. Many conservatives have focused on this issue, emphasizing protections for women’s sports.",The order allows US government agencies to cut funding to schools that permit transgender athletes to compete on women’s teams. Trump also said he would push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

Older-model Blackhawk lacked certain safety technologies



The Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport was flying about 100 feet higher than what was authorized but it was also dealing with a set of complex flying conditions, reports based on the new revelations of the investigation into the DC plane crash said. The Blackhawk crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67 people leaving no survivor.The National Transportation Safety Board said in an update Tuesday that it obtained data clearing showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision. But what prompted the helicopter to change its altitude is not yet known.According to experts, 200 feet is a low altitude for the bust airspace, in proximity to other aircraft. The lighting conditions around the Potomac River are tough and there's not many place in the world where all these conditions are present all at once.The Army crew was flying an older-model aircraft that lacked certain safety technologies in its cockpit. The Blackhawk left its home base, Fort Belvoir in Virginia, after dark last Wednesday to conduct a training mission to allow co-pilot Captain Rebecca Lobach to perform a required annual evaluation flight.It was a moonless night at a busy airspace which might have compounded the complex situation that the helicopter found it self in, experts told the New York Times.""Captain Lobach was most likely in the right-hand seat, said a senior Army official who has flown the National Airport helicopter routes repeatedly but requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly,"" the NYT report said.""This is significant, the official said, because if the instructor pilot was busy or distracted with something, Captain Lobach’s seat on the right side of the aircraft might have put her in poor position to view the descending American Airlines flight on her left.""""Still, other experienced military pilots said they were puzzled at the crash, given that military pilots are trained to be ready for such hazards,"" the report said.","The National Transportation Safety Board said in an update Tuesday that it obtained data showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision.

Was her name kept a secret?

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted. ""They deleted Rebecca Lobach’s social media accounts before releasing her name. It wasn’t to grieve,"" one wrote. ""They didn't withhold Rebecca Lobach's name to ""grieve"", they kept it secret while they scrubbed her social media,"" another wrote.Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Laura Lommer said Rebecca Lobach was a Biden aide who attended Pride events. ""So yes, DEI was very much involved in this crash. Trump was right,"" Loomer wrote hinting that Lobach was a lesbian.""PART TIME Blackhawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, was the name being withheld.

Donald Trump's land grab goes from Greenland to Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-land-grab-goes-from-greenland-to-gaza/articleshow/117954846.cms,"WASHINGTON: In an idea that is audacious and incredible to some and outrageous and abominable to others, America's realtor-turned-President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed the US seizing control of Gaza , scattering its 2 million devastated people elsewhere in the region, and developing the territory into a dazzling ""Riviera of the Middle East.""In an astonishing proposition that drew the proverbial clattering of jaws, bursting of blood vessels, and gasps of disbelief, Trump casually dropped the bombshell at a joint White House presser with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, treating what Palestinians regard as a hallowed homeland as a piece of real estate that is too wasted and dangerous to be re-occupied by them, but which could be rebuilt for others.“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza. I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They’ve lived like hell,"" Trump said, referring to Israel's devastating razing of Gaza to avenge the Oct 7 terrorist attacks on Israel that has rendered the territory uninhabitable. ""Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative,” he added in a proposal tantamount to a US-led ethnic cleansing.Incredulity coursed through the journalists' throng as Trump proposed wiping out Palestine from history. “You are talking tonight about the U.S. taking over a sovereign territory. What authority would allow you to do that? Are you talking about a permanent occupation?” NBC's Kelly O’Donnell asked.“I do see a long-term ownership position,” Trump responded, adding, ""Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area..."" Trump said, without explaining why it could not be rebuilt for Gazans, and by Gazans.Trump's stunning realty-centric proposal was immediately rejected by Arab countries, including by ally Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement at 4 am local time affirming that its position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering.Even Trump's own allies in the US, including some MAGA principals, were taken aback, saying he should be focused on ""America first"" rather than get distracted by a middle-east project.Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump ally, called the proposal “problematic,” while another Republican Senator Thom Tillis said there were “a few kinks in that slinky.""Democrat lawmakers were less inhibited and called the idea ""nuts"" and ""deranged."" Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told reporters, “You can report that I was speechless,” before adding, ""That’s insane. I can’t think of a place on Earth that would welcome American troops less and where any positive outcome is less likely.”Trump's stunning proposal was prefaced -- and perhaps encouraged -- by remarks from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who praised the MAGA supremo's ""willingness to puncture conventional thinking... willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas... cut to the chase, see things others refuse to see, say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop people scratch their heads and say, 'You know, he’s right.'""Coming after other geo-politically stunning ideas like buying or absorbing Greenland and Canada into the US and retaking the Panama Canal, Trump's Gaza gambit was not dismissed outright although some commentators did argue that it may have been aimed at diverting attention from the turbulent developments in Washington DC where the President's major domo Elon Musk is hacking down the traditional establishment.Some Trump aides suggested that the US President was merely grandstanding and his remarks were aimed at galvanizing other Arab states to come up with solutions rather than leave Palestinians in the lurch. ""It's going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions,"" Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said in one TV interview.While Trump appears to have loosened Chinese tentacles enveloping the Panama Canal and bullied Canada and Mexico into making modest concessions that his supporters are portraying as big wins, his grab for Greenland and Canada remains sketchy. Many MAGA activists are in fact unhappy that he is expending so much energy on geo-political projects after having pledged that the US would not get into foreign conflicts.","President Donald Trump proposed the US seizing control of Gaza and developing the territory into a dazzling ""Riviera of the Middle East"" The proposal was immediately rejected by Arab countries, including by ally Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement at 4 am local time affirming that its position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117954920,imgsize-31152,width-400,resizemode-4/117954920.jpg"

Iran’s position is clear: it is a member of the Non Proliferation Treaty, and the Supreme Leader’s fatwa has already clarified our stance [against weapons of mass destruction].""""Maximum pressure is a failed experience and trying it again will lead to another failure,"" Reuters quoted him saying.Trump's initial ""maximum pressure"" campaign began during his presidency after withdrawing from the international nuclear agreement, which had previously eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for nuclear programme restrictions.Subsequently, Iran increased uranium enrichment to 60% purity, approaching the 90% weapons-grade level, as reported to Reuters by the UN nuclear watchdog chief in December.On Wednesday, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson dismissed allegations about plans to kill US officials as ""fabrications by warmongers,"" stating that Iran sought legal justice for its slain officials.This includes Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani , who died in a 2020 US air strike. These statements followed Trump's Tuesday declaration that Iran would face obliteration if it attempted to harm him.","US President Donald Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice.""

In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.
