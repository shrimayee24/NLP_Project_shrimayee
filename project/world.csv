NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control. The body was recovered and sent to the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for autopsy. No case has been filed so far. “We are searching for his relatives.

There is no space for such violence in new Bangladesh. The perpetrators of this heinous crimine will not be spared,"" the statement read.The killing comes amid a broader wave of violence across Bangladesh following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a 32-year-old student leader and key figure in last year’s uprising.

Prothom Alo executive editor Sajjad Sharif said the attack was “an attack on freedom of the press, expression, dissent and diversity of opinion”.The violence has drawn international concern. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed and urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety of journalists and hold those responsible accountable.In New Delhi, a parliamentary standing committee on external affairs said the situation in Bangladesh was “complex and evolving” and flagged continued attacks on minorities, media groups and intellectuals. “The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,” the panel said in a report presented in Parliament.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India remains concerned about extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, even as it continues engagement with the interim government and seeks to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments.Police in Bangladesh have launched a manhunt for Hadi’s attackers and announced a reward for information leading to their arrest, as authorities struggle to contain unrest that has raised fresh questions about law and order and minority safety in the country.","A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district.

Sex assault: Ex-principal jailed after sign language testimony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sex-assault-ex-principal-jailed-after-sign-language-testimony/articleshow/126083770.cms,"MUMBAI: With victims and eyewitnesses deposing in sign language, a special Pocso court recently convicted and sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment the former headmaster and a retired teacher of a school for the deaf and aphasic for the sexual assault of three students between 2013 and 2014.The judge noted school is a ""pious institute"" and children trust their teachers and consider them as guiding light for life. ""If this trust is betrayed and when (a) Godlike figure himself sexually tortures, no doubt the victims would carry a trauma for life,"" special judge Satyanarayan R Navander said.Finding the accused, both in their 60s, guilty of aggravated sexual assault, the court said ""the accused were teachers of the school for the deaf and dumb students i.e. the victims. That way, the victims were in their custody and care. Misusing their position of trust and taking undue advantage of their physical disability, the accused had committed sexual assault.""The court summoned experts in sign language to act as official interpreters. One expert, Sanyogita Devale, assisted during police investigation, while another, Bharati Lele, assisted during trial to translate the victims' gestures into spoken word for the record.The initial statements of victims were video-recorded by police to ensure their gestures and signs were captured accurately before the trial began.The conviction came despite the primary informant and her mother turning hostile. The judge relied on ""clinching evidence"" provided by another victim and an eyewitness student, both of whom remained consistent in their deposition despite being subjected to lengthy cross-examination.The judge said no extraordinary leniency can be shown to the accused while awarding the sentence despite their advanced age. The judge noted that for the ""physically challenged students"", with bare support, it was not easy to approach the police and file a complaint. ""Only because of the status the teachers enjoy, the parents did not believe the victims. However, when the illicit acts persisted, when the victims multiplied and assault was made repeatedly. .. they raised the voice and ultimately approached the law-implementing machinery... The steps taken by them itself (sic) connotes the gravity of the torture they suffered,"" the judge said.On her first day of deposition, the child who had first complained to police affirmed the allegations against the headmaster. After a delay in the trial, she returned to court and completely changed her story. She began claiming the headmaster treated everyone ""like his child"" and any touching was merely a ""pat on the back"" for good grades. The judge observed that the victims appeared to have been ""won over"" by the accused during the decade-long wait for trial.The judge also said that the later retractions by witnesses seemed to be the ""outcome of undue influence and pressure of accused.""The defence claimed all the victims were ""tutored"" by a social activist because she wanted to force the school to adopt a sign-language curriculum. However, the victims deposed that while the activists ""guided them on how to approach the police,"" the decision to seek justice came from the students and their families.""From the assessment of the evidence of the victims and the witnesses... it is found that Sangita Gala (activist) certainly helped the victims and their parents to approach police and lodge complaint... No malice can be attributed to her for the efforts made... to secure justice for the specially abled victims,"" the judge said. The duo were also fined Rs 25,000 each. Out of this amount, Rs 15,000 is to be given to each of the victims as compensation. ""The amount of... Rs 15,000 per victim is inadequate and an additional compensation may be awarded by the state. For that purpose, the copy of judgment and order be forwarded to the District Legal Services Authority, Mumbai, to consider the case under the victim compensation scheme,"" the judge said.The case dates back to July 2014, when a 13-year-old student, assisted by social activist Gala, filed a complaint at Dadar police station. The investigation revealed a pattern of systemic abuse occurring between June 2013 and June 2014. According to the victim, the headmaster frequently summoned young female students to his office under the guise of academic appreciation, where he would sexually assault them. Meanwhile, the teacher was found to have sexually harassed students during typing classes.",The former headmaster and a retired teacher of a school for the deaf and aphasic were convicted and sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

What was the controversy?

Opposition calls it 'cheap mentality':

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Thursday defended Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar after a video showing him pulling down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme went viral. He claimed that there was “nothing wrong” in the chief minister’s action.On reportedly being asked about the woman at the centre of the row may refuse to take up the government job, Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell”. He added that Kumar “has done nothing wrong” and framed the incident as a procedural act.“Whether she refuses the job or goes to hell, that is her choice,” Singh said.Defending Nitish, the union minister argued that the incident should not be viewed through a religious lens and described the chief minister’s action as that of a guardian verifying identity at an official function.“If someone is going to collect an appointment letter, should they not show their face? Is this some Islamic country? Nitish Kumar acted as a guardian,” Singh said.Drawing parallels with other official procedures, he added, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India.In India, the rule of law prevails.”The controversy stems from an incident earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme for newly recruited AYUSH doctors at the chief minister’s residence in Patna.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish Kumar on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.When a woman doctor, identified as Nusrat Parveen, approached the stage with her face covered by a hijab, Kumar appeared displeased, remarked “What is this?”, bent down and pulled the veil down.The woman was seen visibly flustered as an official moved her aside, while Samrat Choudhary appeared to tug at Kumar’s sleeve, seemingly trying to restrain him.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the programme involved the distribution of appointment letters to 1,283 AYUSH doctors, including Ayurveda, Homeopathy and Unani practitioners, with only 10 receiving letters in person and the rest online.The incident and union minister's comments drew sharp criticism from opposition parties. Congress MP Tariq Anwar called Singh’s statement indicative of a “cheap mentality” and condemned Kumar’s action as “shameful and saddening”.""These are third-rate people, they have a cheap mindset. They dont understand that our country is secular. Everyone is free to practice their religion. What Nitish Kumar has done is shameful and saddening,"" Anwar said.Reacting to Singh's statement, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said: ""This is exactly what we can expect from the BJP. If it had been a Hindu woman from Rajasthan or Haryana, wearing a veil, and I had removed it, would the BJP have said the same thing? Imagine the uproar if a Muslim leader had removed the veil of a Hindu woman. But now, because it was a Muslim woman doctor, the BJP's reaction is different. What else can we expect from them?""Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Iltija Mufti also expressed outrage, saying such remarks and acts are deeply offensive to Muslim women.""Only phenyl will work to clean this man's filthy mouth. You dare not touch the hijabs & naqabs of our Muslim mothers and sisters. Otherwise we Muslim women will set you right by teaching you a lesson you and your ilk will remember for all times to come,"" she said in a post on X.NCP (SP) MP Fauzia Khan also hit out at both leaders.""It is very saddening that responsible people do such acts, this will send a wrong message in the world. It is a personal decision of a woman as to how much she covers up and removing the veil is akin to disrobing a woman. He (Kumar) should have given a pubic apology but instead of that they are saying that what happened was right,"" she said.RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were “unsettling” and raised serious concerns, adding that such actions did not send a good message from the state’s top constitutional authority.The Congress also came down heavily on the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “shameless” and “vile” and demanding his resignation.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat said the incident was condemnable and violated traditions and faith, while the party said publicly humiliating a woman at a government event raised questions about women’s safety and dignity.""This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Leaders from other opposition parties echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said no one, regardless of position, had the right to publicly humiliate an adult woman for her choice of attire, stressing that equality must be rooted in consent. The AAP also criticised the incident, warning against normalising control over women’s choices.Amid the outrage, the BJP sought to counter the criticism by sharing an old video of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot removing a woman’s ghoonghat, arguing that the opposition was being selective in its outrage. BJP leaders also accused opposition parties of politicising the issue for electoral gains.The row further escalated after Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad made controversial remarks defending Kumar, which were widely criticised as misogynistic.Nishad later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments, even as opposition parties continued to demand an unconditional apology.",Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme.

KARWAR: A GPS-tagged migratory seagull on Karwar beach on Wednesday sparked curiosity and suspicion in equal measure among locals, before forest officials clarified that the device was part of a scientific study tracking migration pattern of birds.The exhausted bird fitted with the tracking device was rescued by forest department officials after locals noticed the unusual attachment and raised an alert.The bird, which appeared tired and had sustained minor injuries, was brought to the forest department office for examination. Officials confirmed that the device was a GPS tracker used for scientific research to study migration patterns.Forest department sources said they contacted the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka (WNPS), which confirmed that it had tagged the bird as part of a long-term migration study. Although the tracker was manufactured in China — a common source for such equipment — authorities ruled out any surveillance or espionage angle.A section of the media went on an overdive speculating that the tracker may be a spy camera as the INS Kadamba naval base was nearby. However, officials clarified that the device contained no camera.Data retrieved from the tracker indicated that the seagull had flown over 10,000 km, including across Arctic regions, before reaching Karwar.After the GPS unit was safely removed, the bird was moved to the forest department office.Police and intelligence officials visited the beach to verify details and confirmed that the incident posed no security concern.Authorities urged the public not to spread misinformation, stressing that GPS tagging is a standard practice in wildlife research to study migratory routes of avians.",A migratory seagull with a GPS tracker on Karwar beach sparked curiosity and suspicion among locals.

Newly released documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson , musician Mick Jagger , and former US President Bill Clinton.The images were made public by the US Justice Department on Friday as part of a long-awaited government disclosure.The US Department of Justice published thousands of heavily redacted pages under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November.Jeffrey Epstein’s released files and contact lists include the name of Michael Jackson, and court documents show the pop star was at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion at least once, according to a deposition. There is no evidence that Jackson was involved in Epstein’s crimes, and inclusion in the records reflects social overlap, not guilt.The Epstein files include Mick Jagger’s name in contact lists and social records tied to Epstein’s network, placing the Rolling Stones frontman among many celebrities whose details appeared in the documents. There is no public evidence linking Jagger to criminal activity or involvement in Epstein’s offences.Newly released Epstein documents contain photos and records showing former President Bill Clinton in social settings with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including images of Clinton in a pool and at events with others. Clinton has denied knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and no charges have been brought against him.The earlier disclosures included pictures of other well-known public figures, such as billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, philosopher Noam Chomsky, Sergey Brin and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. These photos were released by Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee, which secured tens of thousands of images from Epstein’s estate.","Newly released documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with high-profile figures.

The US Justice Department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following lengthy efforts to make government records about the case public.The release comes under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November. It required unclassified documents in the department’s possession to be made public by December 19, 2025.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News on Friday that the Justice Department would publish “several hundred thousand” pages of documents on the deadline, but he said that the full set will not be released at once and additional batches are expected over the coming weeks.Blanche said the department needed extra time to protect victim identities and ensure that names and identifying details are appropriately redacted.The newly released documents include a wide range of investigative material generated over nearly two decades of federal scrutiny into Epstein’s conduct and network. These materials may comprise photographs, internal law enforcement communications, evidence inventories, and other records related to multiple aspects of the Epstein investigation, according to CBS news.In addition to Friday's Justice Department release, lawmakers and committees have previously made thousands of pages of materials public through subpoenas and voluntary disclosures. In September, the House Oversight Committee released tens of thousands of pages of files ranging from court records and flight logs to videos of Epstein’s jail cell before his death. The earlier revelations included previously available material as well as a new context for Epstein’s relationships with powerful figures.

Nicole Lunders and Greg Biffle’s relationship, divorce, and life as Emma Elizabeth’s mother

Nicole Lunders is known as the ex-wife of NASCAR driver Gregory Jack Biffle and the mother of their daughter, Emma Elizabeth Biffle. In recent days, Nicole has been in the public eye again after reports confirmed that Emma Elizabeth died in a tragic plane crash in North Carolina. Officials are still investigating what caused the crash, and many questions remain unanswered.The plane went down near Statesville Regional Airport in December 2025. Local authorities confirmed that everyone on board died after the aircraft caught fire while attempting to land. The names of the victims were not released right away. Later, family friends told Associated Press and ABC News that Emma Elizabeth was among those killed. Reports also said the flight was connected to Greg Biffle’s family. As the investigation continues, attention has turned to Nicole Lunders, not for her past marriage, but because she has lost her only child in a sudden and heartbreaking way.Nicole Lunders and Gregory Jack Biffle were together for many years before getting married in 2007. During Greg’s rise in NASCAR, Nicole stayed mostly out of the spotlight. She was often seen supporting him at races but kept her personal life private.The couple welcomed Emma Elizabeth during their marriage. Even after Nicole and Greg separated in 2015 and finalized their divorce in 2016, both remained closely involved in raising their daughter. Friends have often said Emma was the center of both parents’ lives.After the divorce, Nicole focused on being a full-time mother. She avoided public attention and did not stay active on social media. Emma, however, was sometimes seen with her father at racing events and special ceremonies. In September 2025, Emma attended an event where Greg Biffle was honored at the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame, showing they shared a strong bond.That is why the plane crash has shocked so many people. Authorities, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, are still working to find out what went wrong. Officials have asked the public for patience as the investigation moves forward.For Nicole Lunders, the focus now is not public attention, but grief. She is being remembered as a devoted mother facing an unimaginable loss, as the racing world and fans continue to mourn young Emma Elizabeth.Also Read: Greg Biffle Net Worth In 2025: NASCAR Star, Career, Family, Income And Death In Plane Crash","Nicole Lunders is the ex-wife of NASCAR driver Gregory Jack Biffle and the mother of their daughter, Emma Elizabeth.

Megyn Kelly reacts after Ben Shapiro and Bari Weiss target Candace Owens at AmericaFest





Megyn Kelly did not hold back after journalist Bari Weiss praised Ben Shapiro for attacking Candace Owens at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest. The event began on December 18, and it quickly turned tense when Shapiro took the stage. His speech focused on what he called dangerous conspiracy talk linked to false claims about Charlie Kirk ’s death. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, is alive, but rumors and online theories have spread in recent months.After Ben Shapiro’s speech, Bari Weiss shared her support on X, calling his remarks strong and necessary. That post triggered a sharp response from Megyn Kelly. Kelly said both Weiss and Shapiro spoke without knowing what had been happening privately for months. She also said people should have checked with Turning Point USA and Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife, before making public attacks. The clash has now turned into a loud public fight between major conservative media figures, with Candace Owens also firing back online.Ben Shapiro used his TPUSA AmFest speech to call out Candace Owens by name. He accused her of spreading conspiracy theories and demanding answers without proof. Speaking from the stage, Shapiro said:“We also have a duty to provide you with evidence of the claims that we make.Emotive accusations, conspiracy theories, and just casting questions. That’s lazy and stupid and misleading… So when Candace Owens says, ‘I don’t know, no, but I know,’ that is retarded. And we are all more retarded for having heard it.”Shapiro also said people with large platforms must speak up. He added:“If Candace Owens decides to spend every day since the murder of Charlie Kirk casting aspersions at TPUSA… then we as people with a microphone have a moral obligation to call that out by name.”There has been no murder of Charlie Kirk, and the claims Shapiro referred to have been widely described as false.Soon after the speech, Bari Weiss posted on X and shared an adapted version of Shapiro’s remarks published by The Free Press. She wrote:“Only Cowards Tolerate Conspiracy Theorists. @benshapiro delivered a barnburner tonight @TPUSA.”That post drew an immediate response from Megyn Kelly, who said Weiss and Shapiro acted without full context. Megyn Kelly replied on X:“@benshapiro & @bariweiss in a joint attack on yours truly (their ‘friend’) tonight w/o a damn clue what has been going on behind the scenes for months. Prob should have checked w/ @TPUSA & @MrsErikaKirk first. I’m embarrassed for them.”Kelly later said on her podcast that Erika Kirk had asked her to help quietly fix the situation. She said she had been working behind the scenes to ease tensions between Candace Owens and Erika Kirk, and felt the public attacks made things worse.Candace Owens also responded online after the speech. In one X post, she wrote that it was “beyond obvious” Ben Shapiro was “fearful” about something related to the controversy.Also Read: “I Don’t Have Concrete Evidence”: Candace Owens Admits Lack Of Proof As Piers Morgan Presses On Charlie Kirk Assassination",Bari Weiss praised Ben Shapiro for attacking Candace Owens at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest.

A mob of protesters set the offices of Bangladeshi newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star on fire after Sharif Osman Hadi , Bangladesh’s youth leader, was killed after being shot in the head on December 12.According to witnesses, hundreds of Hadi’s supporters chanted slogans before setting the building in Dhaka on fire around midnight.Prothom Alo’s executive editor Sajjad Sharif narrated the incident and described it as the “darkest night” for newspapers in Bangladesh.“Some miscreants vandalised our media house. Last night, while our journalists were working on tomorrow’s newspaper and online platforms, a tragic incident occurred. One of the leaders of last year’s uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was killed by someone after being shot, and he died yesterday,” he said.“There was anger in society, and the miscreants channelled that anger to demolish newspapers. They attacked us, and our journalists were scared to death. They had to flee the office. We couldn’t publish our newspaper today, and our online site has been offline since last night. Since its establishment in 1998, in 27 years, this is the first time we haven’t published our newspaper.It is the darkest night for newspapers,” he added.Sharif further urged the government to conduct a proper investigation to identify the miscreants and bring them to justice.“It’s an attack on our freedom of speech and freedom of the news media. We urge the government to conduct a proper investigation to find the miscreants and bring them under the law,” he said.A fresh wave of unrest has been ignited following the death of the 32-year-old student leader. Hadi was shot in the head by masked gunmen in central Dhaka while launching his election campaign and died six days later in a Singapore hospital. His death has reignited political instability at a time when Bangladesh is preparing for a crucial national election and recalibrating its relationship with New Delhi.Emerging from the July Uprising, Hadi had become the convenor and spokesperson of Inquilab Mancha, a platform opposed to all forms of political domination. Educated at the University of Dhaka, he was a fierce critic not only of the Awami League but of mainstream politics as a whole. He rejected established Bangladeshi political elites and positioned himself as a voice of generational rupture.Authorities said Hadi was attacked while riding in a rickshaw near Box Culvert Road in the Motijheel area. He was shot near his left ear, lost significant blood and remained in critical condition before being airlifted abroad.Police initially said it was unclear who carried out the attack or why. His death, confirmed by interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, immediately sparked protests across Dhaka and other cities, with demonstrators vandalising buildings, torching newspaper offices and targeting symbols linked to the political establishment.",Sharif Osman Hadi was killed after being shot in the head on December 12.

US President Donald Trump’s name was affixed to the front of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Friday morning, irking some people, especially the Kennedy family.Kerry Kennedy, daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, said she would “grab a pickax” to remove President Trump’s name from the Kennedy Center after letters spelling Trump’s name were added.“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy posted on the social platform X. “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”The Kennedy Center board voted to include Trump’s name on the building on Thursday, and the exterior now reads “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”Kerry Kennedy criticised the name change as it related to her uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, saying he “proudly stood for justice, peace, equality, dignity, diversity, and compassion for those who suffer.”“President Trump stands in opposition to these values, and his name should not be placed alongside President Kennedy’s,” she wrote in a post on X.Other Kennedy family members also opposed the renaming. Maria Shriver, former President Kennedy’s niece and former first lady of California, described the change as “not dignified” and “not funny.”“It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable,” Shriver wrote on X. “It is not. Next thing perhaps he will want to rename JFK Airport, rename the Lincoln Memorial, the Trump Lincoln Memorial. The Trump Jefferson Memorial. The Trump Smithsonian. The list goes on.”Robert F. Kennedy’s grandson, former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), questioned the legality of the new name, noting that the centre “is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law.”“It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,” he wrote on X.The centre’s interim President Richard Grenell rejected doubts over the legality of the name change, arguing on X that the board’s vote “doesn’t impact the Memorial to Kennedy set up by Congress.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Roma Daravi, the vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, confirmed the name change.Trump, who serves as the centre’s board chair and handpicked its members earlier this year, praised the vote, calling the board “the most distinguished people in the country” and telling reporters the centre was “in such bad shape, physically, financially, and in every other way, and now it’s very solid, very strong.”The President had teased the centre’s new name while emceeing the Kennedy Center Honors earlier this month. “The Trump Kennedy Center,” he said to the audience before adding with a grin, “Oops.”",US President Donald Trump’s name was affixed to the front of the John F.

‘Are You Kidding Me…’: Fuming Jeffries Calls Out Trump 'Sycophants' On Kennedy Center Renaming





Recognising his tasteful appreciation of fine arts and his architectural aesthetics, not to speak of his modesty and humility, the board of trustees of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC voted on Thursday to rename the national arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.The name change was reportedly initiated by former White House personnel director and currently US ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who set the ball rolling at a meeting of the board that includes vice-president JD Vance’s wife, second lady Usha Vance, commerce secretary Howard Lutlick’s wife Allison Lutnick, and a host of MAGA leading lights, including his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo. Trump himself was elected chairman after board members of the Biden dispensation were sent packing earlier this year.According to the White House, the change reflects President Donald Trump’s heroic intervention to save the building from “financial ruin and physical destruction”, a fate it narrowly avoided despite having hosted world-class opera, ballet, theatre, and concerts — many by performers from India — for more than 50 years.Apparently, decades of sold-out performances were merely a prolonged warning sign, like a ceiling crack only visible to real estate developers.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt credited Trump with rescuing the centre from collapse, suggesting that the arts had been moments away from total annihilation until the president — best known in cultural circles for “The Art of the Deal” and plating the Oval Office in gold — stepped in. Critics noted that Congress had already appropriated roughly $257 million for renovations, but supporters say this only underscores Trump’s generosity in allowing federal money to be spent while also taking personal credit.President Trump said he was “surprised” and “honoured” by the decision, adding that he plans to make “a lot of changes”. The rebranding follows the 2025 Kennedy Center Honours, which President Trump hosted himself. During the ceremony, he unsubtly referred to the venue as the Trump-Kennedy Center, a “gaffe” that now appears to have been more of a soft launch.The vote itself has attracted some scrutiny. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, an ex-officio board member, said she was repeatedly muted during a conference call and never had the chance to object. Other than that, the vote was “unanimous”. Members of the Kennedy family responded with outrage. Maria Shriver, President Kennedy’s niece and former journalist who was married to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, called the move “beyond comprehension”, “not dignified”, and “downright weird”, adding that perhaps the administration might next consider renaming JFK Airport or the Lincoln Memorial. Other Kennedy family members pointed out that the Kennedy Center is a congressionally designated living memorial, protected by federal law, and the name cannot be changed without congressional approval. Social media users pitched in, proposing additional naming opportunities, including renaming the Lincoln Memorial as the Trump-Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument as the Trump-Washington Monument.“If we’re renaming landmarks like the Kennedy Center and the Gulf of Mexico, why stop there? Rename the United States to the United States of Trump,” read one snarky post.","The board of trustees of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC voted on Thursday to rename the national arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.

Hakeem Jeffries Explodes At Trump, Johnson, Dems Refuse To ‘BEND THE KNEE’ Over Obamacare Crisis

US President Donald Trump on Friday announced agreements with nine major pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices in the United States, marking a significant push to align domestic costs with those paid in other rich countries.The companies include Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.Under the deals, the drugmakers will rein in prices for medicines sold through Medicaid, charging rates comparable to what they levy in other wealthy nations.New drugs launched by these companies will also follow “most-favored-nation” pricing across all markets, including commercial insurance, cash-pay customers, Medicare and Medicaid, according to news agency AP.Trump said the agreements would end a system in which US patients paid far more than the rest of the world. “We were subsidising the entire world. We’re not doing it anymore,” he said at a White House press conference, according to Reuters.US prescription drug prices are often nearly three times higher than those in other developed countries.The companies also agreed to list pharmacy-ready medicines on a new direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, set to launch in January, allowing patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.As per Reuters, some firms will offer discounts of up to 70% on select medicines, although analysts noted that Medicaid already receives steep rebates.Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis free to Medicaid, a move described by health economist William Padula as “a thoughtful health equity move,” as per AP.Several companies also pledged to donate active pharmaceutical ingredients to a national reserve for use during emergencies.Markets reacted positively, with shares of most participating drugmakers rising, Reuters said, as the agreements also grant a three-year exemption from threatened pharmaceutical tariffs in return for commitments to invest in US manufacturing.Trump said he had warned companies of possible tariffs to push them to “do the right thing,” AP reported.According to CNBC, the administration has now secured pricing agreements with 14 of the 17 drugmakers it approached earlier this year, with negotiations continuing with the remaining firms.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced agreements with nine major pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices in the United States.

What to expect next?





The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, lightning and hail in some areas. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast this pattern to persist through Friday, with scattered showers and varying rain intensity across emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the northern regions. Winds are moderate to strong at times, stirring dust and reducing visibility, while sea conditions remain rough along the coast.This unsettled weather follows days of rain and cloud activity, and residents should expect spotty downpours and wet conditions throughout the day.Authorities across the UAE have issued strong safety advisories, urging residents to remain cautious:The National Centre of Meteorology advised people to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms and stay updated through official channels.Police departments in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah warned motorists to reduce speed, maintain safe distances and avoid flooded roads, stressing that water-logged streets can be deceptively dangerous.Civil Defence teams across several emirates remain on standby, responding to weather-related incidents and assisting affected areas.Residents were also advised to stay away from wadis and low-lying areas, where fast-moving water poses serious risks.If you were planning to commute between emirates today, you might need to rethink your schedule. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman until further notice. This decision was made to keep passengers safe as visibility drops and water accumulates on major highways. While public buses within Dubai are still operating, the RTA warns that commuters should expect significant delays.The disruption isn't just on the roads; it has reached the skies as well. At Dubai International (DXB), Emirates and flydubai have been forced to cancel or reschedule multiple flights due to the unstable conditions. Passengers are being urged to check their flight status online before even heading to the airport, as access roads are also facing heavy traffic and localized flooding. In Abu Dhabi, Zayed International Airport is also on high alert, with authorities advising travelers to allow extra time for their journey.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), the umbrella-weather isn't going away just yet. The unstable conditions are expected to persist throughout Saturday, December 20, particularly in coastal, northern, and eastern areas. Winds could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h, and the seas will remain rough, making any maritime activity dangerous.As the UAE navigates this stormy period, the sense of community resilience is high. Authorities continue to provide minute-by-minute updates on social media, reminding everyone that while the rain may be heavy, the safety measures in place are even stronger.","The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel's coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal ""greatly strengthens Israel's position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region.""Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel's offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu's announcement.Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas - first to Jordan and later to Egypt - nearly a decade ago.In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel's sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel's defense ministry said Wednesday.The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry. Germany moved to buy Arrow 3 from Israel as it seeks to strengthen its air defenses against Russia.",The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.

Peace prize to Venezuela's Machado: Why is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suing Nobel panel?

‘Vulgar Act Of Piracy’: Venezuela Slams Trump’s Total Naval Blockade, Warns Global Energy Crisis





WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes and of facilitating war crimes, following the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado The complaint, submitted to Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) and the War Crimes Unit (Krigsbrottsenheten), names around 30 individuals, including Nobel Foundation chair Astrid Söderbergh Widding and executive director Hanna Stjärne. Assange alleges breach of trust, gross misappropriation of funds, conspiracy, and the facilitation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement shared by WikiLeaks on X, the organisation said Assange’s legal action is aimed at preventing the release of more than $1 million that Machado is set to receive as part of the award. The filing seeks an immediate freeze on the pending SEK 11 million ($1.18 million) prize transfer and calls for a full criminal investigation.The complaint cites Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will, which stipulates that the Peace Prize be granted only to individuals who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” by doing “the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”Assange argues that “The political decision of the Norwegian selection committee does not suspend the fiduciary duty of Swedish funds administrators,” adding that “Any disbursement contradicting this mandate constitutes misappropriation from the endowment. ”Assange’s filing contends that Machado’s public endorsement of US President Donald Trump and the administration’s military actions, which the complaint frames as contributing to war crimes, provides sufficient legal grounds for the Nobel Foundation to suspend all financial disbursements linked to the prize. “Alfred Nobel’s endowment for peace cannot be spent on the promotion of war,” Assange said, alleging that Machado “has continued to incite the Trump Administration to pursue its escalatory path” against Venezuela.The complaint also cites precedent within the Nobel system, noting that Nobel Foundation officials exercised supervisory authority by withholding prize-related disbursements in 2018. Assange argues that, having previously intervened to halt payments, Nobel officials were legally obliged to do so again and that failure to intervene in the present case “incurs criminal liability” under Swedish law.The filing explicitly invokes Sweden’s obligations under Article 25(3)(c) of the Rome Statute, arguing that continued disbursement of Nobel funds, despite knowledge of Machado’s public positions, could amount to facilitating the crime of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Assange has asked authorities to seize internal records, including board minutes and financial documents, interrogate senior Nobel officials, and either pursue a domestic investigation or refer the matter to the International Criminal Court.In October, Machado described her Nobel Peace Prize win as an “immense recognition” of her country’s struggle for democracy and dedicated the award to US President Donald Trump. In a post on X following the announcement, she wrote: “This immense recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to complete our task: to conquer Freedom. We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we have President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!”Speaking to reporters in Oslo last week, hours after her daughter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf, Machado said: “I think that the actions of President Trump have been decisive… Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.” She declined to answer directly whether US military intervention was necessary to oust Maduro.Assange warned that without intervention, the Peace Prize risks being “permanently converted from an instrument of peace into an instrument of war.”","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes.

'Not the beginning of a war'

How Syria responded?





The Donald Trump administration on Friday (local time) carried out large-scale military strikes in Syria hitting more than ""70 Islamic State (IS) targets with over 100 precision munitions"". The strikes came nearly a week after two members of the Iowa National Guard and a US civilian interpreter were killed in a December 13 attack in the Syrian desert.The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said American forces used fighter jets, helicopters and artillery to hit IS infrastructure across central Syria. Sharing a video on X, CENTCOM said, ""Tonight, US and Jordanian forces struck 70+ ISIS targets in Syria with 100+ precision munitions. Peace through strength.""In another post, CENTCOM said, ""CENTCOM forces launched fighter jets, attack helicopters and other assets to conduct the large-scale strike.""Trump said the strikes were part of ""Operation Hawkeye Strike"" and warned any group threatening Americans of severe consequences.In a social media post, Trump said the US was targeting IS ""strongholds"" and reiterated his backing for Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying the Syrian government was ""fully in support"" of the US operation.""Because of ISIS’s vicious killing of brave American Patriots in Syria, whose beautiful souls I welcomed home to American soil earlier this week in a very dignified ceremony, I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible,"" Trump said.""We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated. The Government of Syria, led by a man who is working very hard to bring Greatness back to Syria, and is fully in support. All terrorists who are evil enough to attack Americans are hereby warned — YOU WILL BE HIT HARDER THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BEFORE IF YOU, IN ANY WAY, ATTACK OR THREATEN THE USA,"" he added, issuing a stark warning.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were retaliatory and not a broader escalation. ""This is not the beginning of a war, it is a declaration of vengeance. The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people,"" Hegseth said in a social media post.The attack was carried out using F-15 Eagle fighter jets, A-10 Thunderbolt ground-attack aircraft and AH-64 Apache helicopters, US officials said. F-16 fighter jets from Jordan and HIMARS rocket artillery systems were also used.While Syria did not directly comment on the strikes, its foreign ministry said the country remained committed to eliminating IS presence. In a post on X, the ministry said Syria would continue ""ensuring that it has no safe havens on Syrian territory, and will continue to intensify military operations against it wherever it poses a threat.""Syrian state television reported that the US strikes hit targets in rural areas of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa provinces, as well as the Jabal al-Amour region near Palmyra. The report said the attacks targeted ""weapons storage sites and headquarters used by ISIS as launching points for its operations in the region.""Islamic State has not claimed responsibility for the December 13 attack on US personnel, though it has since claimed two attacks on Syrian security forces, including one in Idlib province that killed four Syrian soldiers.Earlier this week, Trump met privately with the families of the slain Americans at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware before attending the dignified transfer ceremony honoring the fallen service members.The strikes come at a time when the Trump administration has been shifting military focus closer to the Western Hemisphere, including bolstering naval presence in the Caribbean and targeting drug-smuggling networks and sanctioned oil shipments linked to Venezuela.","US Central Command said American forces used fighter jets, helicopters and artillery to hit IS infrastructure across central Syria.

Suspicious links to the recent Brown University shooting and the murder of an MIT professor trace back 30 years and another country, reports the New York Post.Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente, who killed two students at Brown and then two days later an MIT professor, Nuno Loureiro, first crossed paths with Loureiro between 1995 and 2000 at Portugal’s Instituto Superior Técnico, authorities said.“My understanding is that they did know each other,” said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Leah Foley at a Thursday press conference, according to CBS News.Neves Valente came to the United States on an F-1 student visa in 2000 to enrol in a doctoral programme at Brown University. His time at the Ivy League college was brief. He took a leave of absence in spring 2001 and formally left in July 2003. Officials said he had no current ties to the university.He obtained lawful US permanent residency in April 2017. In the weeks leading up to the shootings, he rented a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, in November, and a Boston hotel room later that month. Around December 1, he rented a grey Nissan Sentra with Florida plates, which was seen near Brown’s campus multiple times through December 12.Neves Valente began his attack last Saturday, killing Brown University students Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov. He also wounded nine others in a classroom. He then changed the car’s license plates and travelled to Brookline on Monday to kill Loureiro at his home.Neves Valente reportedly remained active and mobile on Thursday before he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot inside the storage facility he had rented, ending a nearly weeklong manhunt.","Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente, who killed two students at Brown and then two days later an MIT professor, Nuno Loureiro, first crossed paths withLoureiro between 1995 and 2000. “My understanding is that they did know each other,” said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Leah Foley at a Thursday press conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126084418,imgsize-565713,width-400,resizemode-4/126084418.jpg"

Indian-origin Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal criticised US President Donald Trump on X after he ordered a suspension of the US green card lottery.She called the move an exploitation of a recent tragedy to push an anti-immigrant agenda.Pramila said that there is no doubt that visa applicants have to go through tough procedures before even setting foot in the US: “Visa applicants go through some of the most rigorous vetting our country has. Trump is exploiting this horrific tragedy to advance his anti-immigrant, xenophobic agenda and shut down more legal pathways.”The MAGA chief’s decision followed the deadly shootings at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on December 13, where two students were killed and nine others injured. The suspect was a Portuguese national identified as 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, who also allegedly killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro two days later in Massachusetts. However, after an intense manhunt, the shooter's dead body was found in a New Hampshire storage facility. He was found with a self-inflicted gunshot.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said she had instructed the US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the Diversity Visa (DV1) program at Trump’s direction.Valente had entered the United States through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.Noem also raised an alarm regarding the lottery program. She said that Trump had previously moved to end it following the 2017 New York City truck attack by an ISIS-linked terrorist, who also entered the US under the DV1 program.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program allocates up to 50,000 visas each year through a lottery system, targeting applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.

Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones.

Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges.
