Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response and the safe evacuation of all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments. Authorities confirmed there were no injuries.The fire, which was extinguished after nearly six hours of effort, drew swift intervention from Dubai Civil Defence teams, who worked through the night to contain the blaze. In a series of updates on X, the Dubai Media Office (DMO) said: “Specialised teams successfully evacuated all residents… prioritising their health and safety throughout the operation.”Medical and psychological support teams were on-site to assist residents. “Ambulance teams and medical staff are on site to offer full medical and mental support to the safely evacuated residents,” DMO posted at 2:09 am.Authorities also assured that temporary housing arrangements were being made in coordination with the building’s developer to ensure the affected residents' well-being.As firefighting operations continued, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) suspended tram services between Dubai Marina Station (No.5) and Palm Jumeirah Station (No. 9) as a precautionary measure. A replacement shuttle bus service was activated, with the RTA stating, “The safety of our passengers and operations is our top priority.”Tram services will resume only after full safety inspections are conducted, the authority added.Eyewitnesses described the situation as tense, with one resident noting: “At around 1:30am, the fire started to slow down… plenty of debris has been falling.”Thanks to swift action, no surrounding buildings were affected. Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower.

Iran-Israel conflict: Benjamin Netanyahu aims to dethrone Ayatollah's regime; can he bring down Islamic Republic?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-israel-conflict-benjamin-netanyahu-aims-to-dethrone-ayatollahs-regime-can-he-bring-down-islamic-republic/articleshow/121847222.cms,"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (left), and Benjamin Netanyahu

Trying to shake the regime







""The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday in a video statement after Israel struck over 200 military and nuclear sites in Iran.The unannounced strikes were clearly meant to disrupt Tehran's nuclear work and increase the time it would take for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.However, the number of sites hit, the specific nature of the targets, and remarks from Israeli leaders suggest there may be a wider aim: weakening or even removing Iran’s ruling regime.""As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,"" Netanyahu said, referring to Israeli strikes that hit targets across Iran, including nuclear sites, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists.The attacks early Friday went beyond nuclear plants and missile sites. They also targeted senior members of Iran’s military and nuclear experts — moves that, according to a Reuters report, seem designed to damage Iran’s image internally and among its partners in the region. These are actions that could affect the stability of Iran’s leadership.There is already significant dissatisfaction among many people in Iran due to economic struggles, lack of free expression, and ongoing issues related to women’s and minority rights.In this situation, Netanyahu may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic.Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern. From that view, Iran should be offered incentives: if it stops pursuing nuclear weapons and ends its support for armed groups, it could have sanctions removed and be reintegrated into the global system.Others believe the real issue is the continued existence of the Islamic Republic. They argue that Iran’s leadership is unlikely to change its regional behaviour and is working not to deter Israel, but to destroy it. From this perspective, diplomatic talks only help Iran buy time. A nuclear programme seen as illegal gives cover to maintain sanctions, which they hope will eventually weaken a regime they consider beyond repair.There is no common ground between these two positions. And now, more clearly than before, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be in the second group. The recent strikes were not mainly focused on nuclear equipment but on top military commanders of the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime’s hold on power, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in an article in Foreign Policy.Israel might believe that the recent attacks and killings could destabilize the Iranian government and create an opportunity for a public uprising.This is what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping for. But this approach is risky.Even with the damage caused by Israel’s recent attack, there is long-standing hostility toward Israel — not just from Iran’s leadership but also from much of its mostly Shi’ite population. That makes it uncertain whether public anger alone could bring down a well-established religious government that has the support of strong security forces.There is no sign that such a series of events will even begin. And even if it does, there’s no clarity on what direction it would take, a BBC report said.Power in Iran lies mostly with those who control the military and the economy. Much of this power rests with hardliners in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected groups.These groups don’t need to carry out a coup — they already have authority. And they could choose to make Iran more confrontational in response to attacks.Another possible result could be the collapse of the current government, followed by instability in Iran.With a population of nearly 90 million, any unrest in Iran would affect many countries in the Middle East.If Israel is able to remove the Islamic leadership in Tehran, the attack would be seen as successful. But if the leadership stays in place — and history suggests that airstrikes alone rarely bring regime change — then Iran could still keep some part of its nuclear program, Jeffrey Lewis writes.Israel’s national security advisor has already said that Iran might still keep parts of its nuclear capability. So what happens then?One possibility Israel sees is that Iran could agree to a deal with US President Donald Trump to give up its nuclear plans. But another possibility is that Iran could follow North Korea’s path — leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and eventually developing nuclear weapons. In that case, it is unlikely that Russia or China would support new sanctions. They may not even enforce the ones already in place. Russia has been buying Iranian drones, and China imports Iranian oil.The reasons why Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stopped the country’s nuclear weapons program in 2003 — and why he kept that policy — are not fully known. There have been different views within Iran: some have wanted a nuclear weapon, while others have not. Until now, those opposing the bomb have been able to influence policy. But after this recent strike, these discussions will likely change. There will also be new individuals involved in these decisions. People will think about those who are no longer there and ask whether Israel would have acted this way if Iran already had nuclear weapons — or if Israel didn’t have them.If the Iranian government doesn’t fall, Israel might feel the need to carry out more attacks in the future. Even if this strike has seriously disrupted Iran’s nuclear efforts, Iran could restart the program.""In the ideal world, Israel would prefer to see a change of regime, no question about that,"" Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, was quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.If Israel succeeds in removing Iran's leadership, there is no guarantee the successor that emerges would not be even more hardline in pursuit of conflict with Israel.""For years, many in Israel have insisted that regime change in Iran would prompt a new and better day - that nothing could be worse than the current theocratic regime,"" Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""But history tells us it can always be worse.""","Israel may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime's hold on power. Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121850713,imgsize-1199755,width-400,resizemode-4/121850713.jpg"

The US State Department has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for the Dominican Republic, warning American tourists to exercise increased caution amid a rise in violent crime, including robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides.The updated advisory, released Thursday, marks the second such notice in less than a year for the popular Caribbean destination. A Level 2 alert is the second-lowest in the State Department’s four-tier system but still signals elevated risk, particularly in urban areas frequented by tourists.Citing a troubling uptick in violent incidents, the advisory urges travellers to be vigilant and adopt a series of safety precautions: remain aware of surroundings, avoid displaying valuables, use phones discreetly, travel in groups, and refrain from leaving food or drinks unattended. In the event of a robbery, tourists are advised not to resist and to comply with demands.“If you are the victim of a crime,” the advisory says, “you can contact the local 911 service, tourist police (POLITUR), or resort security.” However, it also cautions that perpetrators are “rarely caught and prosecuted.”The Dominican Republic remains a popular getaway for American travellers, but officials stress that increased vigilance is essential as law enforcement struggles to curb crime.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",The US State Department has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for the Dominican Republic.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday distanced itself from a statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iran, clarifying that it did not participate in the discussions that led to the group's remarks.In a statement, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said, “The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has issued a statement on recent developments between Israel and Iran. India did not participate in the discussions on the above-mentioned SCO statement.”The MEA reaffirmed India's independent stance on the Israel-Iran tensions, first articulated on June 13, and reiterated its call for calm and dialogue. “We urge that channels of dialogue and diplomacy be utilised to work towards de-escalation. It is essential that the international community undertake endeavours in that direction,” the statement read.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also conveyed India’s concerns directly to his Iranian counterpart during a recent conversation. According to the MEA, Jaishankar highlighted the international community's deep concern over the rising tensions and emphasized the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic engagement.The SCO statement had strongly denounced Israel’s strikes on Iranian territory, describing them as “aggressive actions against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure,” which it said caused civilian casualties and violated international law and the UN Charter. It also reaffirmed support for resolving tensions around Iran’s nuclear program through peaceful and diplomatic means and expressed condolences to the Iranian people and government.India, however, reiterated its independent stance, first stated on June 13, which emphasized restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy. “India urges both sides to avoid any escalatory steps. Existing channels of dialogue and diplomacy should be utilised to work towards a de-escalation of the situation and resolving underlying issues,” the earlier MEA statement had said.The ministry added that Jaishankar had recently spoken with his Iranian counterpart, conveying the deep concern of the international community and reiterating the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic processes.India emphasized its “close and friendly relations with both countries” and reaffirmed its readiness to extend support towards efforts for peace. The MEA also noted that Indian missions in Iran and Israel remain in contact with the Indian community, advising nationals to remain cautious and follow local advisories.","India distanced itself from a statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iran.

Global airlines suspended flights to Tel Aviv and Tehran as air traffic over the region thinned out overnight.Israel said the strikes were a direct response to the growing threat from Iran’s missile and nuclear capabilities.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday that the Congress made a ""historic blunder"" by allowing Pakistan to become a nuclear power in the 1980s without taking action.He said Pakistan has since used ""nuclear blackmail"" to block international intervention.""At a time when nations today act decisively to neutralise nuclear threats, India’s tragic inaction during the 1980s remains a cautionary tale of what could have been—and what wasn't,"" the Assam CM said in a long post on X.Sarma said intelligence from R&AW had confirmed Pakistan’s uranium enrichment at Kahuta.In his post titled ""Congress's Historic Blunder: How India Let Pakistan Become a Nuclear State"", he claimed Israel offered help—from intel to joint strike planning.

Yet at the last minute: Indira Gandhi hesitated, fearing international fallout,"" the chief minister alleged.He added that Rajiv Gandhi later ""shelved the plan, prioritising diplomacy over deterrence under foreign pressure"".According to Sarma, in 1988 Rajiv Gandhi signed a no-strike nuclear pact with Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto, pledging not to attack each other’s nuclear sites.He noted, ""A decade later, Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998.

CAIRO: Israeli fire and airstrikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, most of them near an aid distribution site operated by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, local health authorities said.Medics at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in central Gaza areas, where most of the casualties were moved to, said at least 15 people were killed as they tried to approach the GHF aid distribution site near the Netzarim corridor.The rest were killed in separate attacks across the enclave, they added.There has been no immediate comment by the Israeli military or the GHF on Saturday's incidents.The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, overseeing a new model of aid distribution which the United Nations says is neither impartial nor neutral.The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.Later on Saturday, the Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards the so-called humanitarian zone area, saying it would forcefully work against ""terror organizations"" in the area.The war in Gaza erupted 20 months ago after Hamas-led militants raided Israel and took 251 hostages and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, on October 7, 2023, Israel's single deadliest day.Israel's military campaign since has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip, which is home to more than two million people.Most of the population is displaced, and malnutrition is widespread.Despite efforts by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to restore a ceasefire in Gaza, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal.",Israeli fire and airstrikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip.

Satellite images have revealed some of the damage sustained by Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and nuclear facilities in the Israeli attack.Images from Planet Labs PBC, analysed by news agency The Associated Press, showed damage at two missile bases - one in Kermanshah and one in Tabriz, both in western Iran.At the mountainside Kermanshah base, burns could be seen across a wide area after the attack. In Tabriz, images showed damage at multiple sites on the base.Meanwhile, at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, southwest of Iranian capital Tehran, the images show multiple buildings either damaged or destroyed; the targeted sites included structures experts say supplied power to the facility. The Natanz photos were taken by Maxar Technologies.At Natanz enrichment plant, now destroyed, Iran had enriched uranium to 60% purity - a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.While all the Natanz facilities damaged in the strikes are above ground, it doesn't appear from the images that there was any apparent impact on the underground enrichment halls.Iran has not acknowledged the damage, though it reported on Israeli strikes in the area.Under its Operation Rising Lion, Israel conducted strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.It also targeted and killed several top officers of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps and scientists of the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme.In retaliation, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel's largest city Tel Aviv, killing three people and injuring dozens.Israel then launched direct strikes targeting the Iranian energy industry and defense ministry headquarters on Sunday, with Iran unleashing a fresh barrage of missiles targeting its arch-rival.","Images show damage at two missile bases - one in Kermanshah and one in Tabriz, both in western Iran.

Iran on Sunday launched a new wave of missile attacks against Israel, prompting Tel Aviv to retaliate with airstrikes on Tehran.

Sirens were reported in multiple parts of Israel as tensions surged.Missile sirens and explosions echoed across several areas of Israel, including Tel Aviv, as Iranian state television confirmed it had launched a new wave of attacks.This latest escalation came just a day after Israel’s high-intensity assault on Iranian military and nuclear sites, which appears to have triggered the current retaliation.Israel's Fire and Rescue Services confirmed that several residential buildings in the country's coastal and northern regions were hit in the attacks. Fires broke out in open areas as a result of the impact.“Several incidents have been reported to the Israel Fire and Rescue Services command centres in the Coastal and Northern Districts, with hits on residential buildings and a fire in an open area,” spokesperson Tal Volbovitz said.In response to the Israeli airstrikes, Iran activated its air defence systems across multiple regions. The escalating attacks marked one of the most intense direct confrontations between the two regional powers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to target “every target of the ayatollah regime,” while Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that “further strikes would draw a more severe and powerful response.”Hours after the initial wave of missile threats, the Israeli army eased the emergency alert, stating that citizens could leave shelters but should remain cautious.“Following the situational assessment, the Home Front Command published that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces in all areas across the country and to remain near them,” the military said.","Iran on Sunday launched a new wave of missile attacks against Israel, prompting Tel Aviv to retaliate with airstrikes on Tehran.

A day after the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic struck the IDF's military base in Tel Aviv, Israel launched a major counteroffensive on Sunday, directly targeting Tehran’s defence and energy infrastructure in a sharp escalation of hostilities between the two arch-rivals.IDF also hit Iranian Shahran oil facility in its latest series of attacks.In response, Iran fired a fresh wave of missiles into Israeli territory, killing four people and injuring several others in the northern Galilee region.The strikes come just days after Israel’s surprise launch of ""Operation Rising Lion,"" targeting Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz. Sunday’s attacks marked the most major Israeli action yet, with targets including Iran’s ministry of defence headquarters and the SPND -- an agency Israel claims is central to Iran’s nuclear weapons development.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed the strikes, stating: “The IDF completed an extensive series of strikes on targets in Tehran related to the Iranian regime’s nuclear weapons project… including the Iranian Ministry of Defence, SPND nuclear project headquarters, and additional sites where the regime hid its nuclear archive.”Loud explosions were reported across eastern and western Tehran late Sunday, with visuals showing heavy smoke billowing over the city skyline.Iranian state media confirmed several areas were hit, but did not release casualty figures immediately.Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said the missiles were aimed at facilities involved in the production of fuel for Israeli fighter jets. ""If Israeli aggression continues, Iran will respond with further missile strikes,"" the Guard said in a statement.The latest developments come just hours after Iran’s Friday night retaliation for the Natanz strike, when it targeted Israel’s heavily fortified Kirya compound in Tel Aviv -- the nerve centre of Israel’s military command and home to its ministry of defence and intelligence units.Israel's Fire and Rescue Services confirmed that multiple residential buildings in the coastal and northern regions were struck during the attacks, sparking fires in open areas. ""Several incidents have been reported to our command centres in the Coastal and Northern Districts, including direct hits on homes and a blaze in an open area,"" said spokesperson Tal Volbovitz.IDF stated, “Iran made its intentions clear — we had no choice but to respond.As Iran advances toward nuclear weapons and continues targeting innocent civilians, the IDF is acting to defend Israel and confront a threat the world cannot afford to overlook.”Adding to global concern, indirect nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States -- scheduled to resume on Sunday -- were abruptly cancelled. Mediator Oman confirmed the cancellation, with a senior US official saying, “We remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will return to the table soon.”World leaders called for urgent de-escalation.

A senior Israeli official has indicated that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could become a direct target, as Israel intensifies its campaign against Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the unnamed official said assassination of Iran’s top leader is ""not off limits,"" underlining a dramatic escalation in Israel’s strategic posture.The statement signals a shift from solely targeting Iran’s nuclear program to potentially dismantling the regime’s leadership structure.The official claimed that Israel’s recent strikes have already inflicted substantial damage, including at the heavily fortified Natanz enrichment facility, where structural collapse was reported. Israel has also taken responsibility for the assassinations of nine nuclear scientists and several high-ranking military officers in recent months.Additional strikes are expected soon, as part of the ongoing Israeli offensive known as 'Operation Rising Lion'.

At least 100 people were killed in a brutal overnight attack by gunmen in Nigeria’s north-central Benue state, Amnesty International Nigeria said Saturday. The massacre occurred between late Friday and the early hours of Saturday in the village of Yelewata, located in the Guma region of the state.The rights group, in a Facebook post, described the attack as one of the deadliest in recent months, saying ""many families were locked up and burnt inside their bedrooms. So many bodies were burnt beyond recognition.""Amnesty also reported that dozens of people remain missing, and hundreds have been left wounded, many without access to medical care.

However, violence between herders and farmers is a persistent issue in Nigeria’s Middle Belt region, often leading to deadly confrontations over land and water rights.Such attacks are frequently blamed on Fulani herders, who graze cattle across traditional farming areas. Local farmers accuse them of destroying crops and forcibly occupying farmlands, while herders argue they are following legally designated grazing routes established under a 1965 law.The region has witnessed similar bloodshed in recent months. In May, at least 20 people were killed in Benue’s Gwer West area in an attack suspected to have been carried out by herders. In April, at least 40 people died in violence in neighbouring Plateau state.Benue State Governor Hyacinth Alia has dispatched a delegation to Yelewata to support the grieving families. “This act of terror is deeply heartbreaking. We are committed to ensuring those responsible are brought to justice,” a spokesperson from the governor’s office said.Benue, often referred to as the “food basket of the nation,” has been a flashpoint for herder-farmer clashes in recent years, contributing to a broader insecurity crisis that has gripped Nigeria’s northern and central states.(With inputs from agencies)","Amnesty International Nigeria says at least 100 people were killed in a brutal overnight attack by gunmen in Nigeria’s north-central Benue state.

DUBAI: Israel's defence minister warned Saturday that ""Tehran will burn"" if Iran continues firing missiles, as the countries traded blows a day after Israel launched a blistering surprise attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, killing several top generals.The attacks have left Iran's surviving leadership with the difficult decision of plunging deeper into conflict with Israel's more powerful forces or seeking a diplomatic route. Israel - which is widely believed to have a nuclear weapons programme - said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days also killed nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear programme.Iran's UN ambassador said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded.Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook buildings. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by the war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. Health officials said three people were killed and dozens wounded. Defence minister Israel Katz said Iran will pay a heavy price for harming Israeli citizens.""If (Iran Supreme leader) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front - Tehran will burn,"" Katz said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that his objective was to eliminate any Iranian threat to Israel, but he also urged Iranians to rise up against their leaders.The US and Iran were scheduled to be in Oman on Sunday for their sixth round of indirect talks over Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's top diplomat said Saturday the talks were ""unjustifiable"" after the Israeli strikes, likely signalling no negotiations this weekend. But he stopped short of saying the talks were cancelled.Iran launched waves of missiles at Israel late Friday and early Saturday, and Iranians awoke to state television airing repeated clips of strikes on Israel, as well as videos of people cheering and handing out sweets. The Iranian attacks killed at least three people and wounded 76, mostly in and around Tel Aviv, according to two local hospitals. One missile severely damaged at least four homes in the nearby city of Rishon Lezion, according to first responders.The Israeli military said seven soldiers were lightly wounded when a missile hit central Israel, without specifying where. It was the first report of Israeli military casualties since the initial Israeli strikes.US ground-based air defence systems in the region were helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity.In Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, an Associated Press journalist saw burned-out cars and at least three damaged houses, including one whose front was nearly entirely torn away. Residents of a central Israeli city that was hit Friday night told the AP the explosion was so powerful it shook their shelter door open.Israeli police said debris from the interception of drones and missiles fell in dozens of locations in northern Israel, causing damage and fires but no injuries.

Iran launched a powerful retaliatory strike late Friday night, targeting one of Israel's most heavily guarded military sites, the Kirya compound in Tel Aviv, following Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz.The Kirya, often referred to as Israel's version of the Pentagon, houses the Israel Defence Forces' (IDF) general staff, the ministry of defence, and critical military command and intelligence units.It also includes Camp Rabin, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and is considered vital for Israel’s national security operations.According to reports, Iran fired a barrage of missiles at the Tel Aviv-based military complex, striking deep into Israel's defence infrastructure.Israel's well-known Iron Dome air defence system failed to stop the targeted attack launched by the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic.Also read: ‘Talks with US meaningless’: Iran rules out nuclear talks; Tehran blames US for backing Israel The New York Times verified alarming social media footage showing a missile slamming into the area, causing what was described as ""significant damage.""""This is Israel’s version of the Pentagon, the Kiryat, and the building on this compound was just hit,"" Fox News reported.""There is significant damage.""The dramatic videos showed Israel’s air defence systems firing interceptors into the night sky moments before a large explosion lit up central Tel Aviv.

In a bid to fill the military vacuum left by Israel’s fatal strikes that killed several top Iranian commanders, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday appointed Major General Amir Hatami as the new Chief Commander of the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran.The announcement, reported by Iranian state media outlet IRNA, marks a significant leadership change as Tehran seeks to stabilise its military structure after Israel’s large-scale offensive.Hatami, who served as Iran's Defence Minister from 2013 to 2021, now steps into a critical role at a time of heightened regional tensions.In his official decree, Khamenei commended Hatami's ""dedication, competence, and experience,"" urging him to lead with a ""transformative and revolutionary approach,"" according to IRNA.Khamenei also expressed gratitude to Major General Seyyed Abdolrahim Mousavi for his ""sincere and valuable efforts"" during his tenure.The reshuffle follows the killing of Iran's former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CSAF) General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, who, according to Iranian authorities, was assassinated ""at the hands of the evil Zionist regime."" Khamenei later appointed Mousavi as Bagheri’s successor.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri at the hands of the evil Zionist regime, & in light of Major General Sayyid Abdolrahim Mousavi's meritorious services & valuable experience, I appoint him as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces,” Khamenei posted on X.Khamenei also made sweeping changes across other key military branches, replacing top officials killed in Israel’s Operation Rising Lion airstrikes.Major General Mohammad Pakpour has been named the new Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the death of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami in the Israeli strikes.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Mohammad Pakpour's meritorious services and valuable experience, I appoint him as Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,” Khamenei announced.Further, Major General Ali Shadmani was appointed Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central Headquarters, following the assassination of Lieutenant General Gholamali Rashid. Khamenei posted, “In view of Lt. Gen. Gholamali Rashid's martyrdom at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Ali Shadmani's meritorious services & valuable experience, I confer the rank of Major Gen. & appoint him Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central HQ. ”According to a CNN report, Israel’s Operation Rising Lion dealt a devastating blow to Iran’s top military leadership, killing high-ranking officers, including the heads of the IRGC, the air force, and a former national security chief.Among the key figures killed was Major General Hossein Salami, the powerful commander of the IRGC who had led the elite force since 2019. Salami played a pivotal role in Iran’s military offensives, including direct missile and drone attacks on Israel in April and October 2024.CNN further reported that Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, was another significant casualty. Bagheri was instrumental in military coordination, foreign policy engagements in Syria, and diplomatic talks with Saudi Arabia.Ali Shamkhani, a long-time aide to Khamenei and former national security chief, also died in the Israeli strike.

We apologise for any offense caused by this image,” the IDF wrote on X.The image, shared with the caption, “Iran is a global threat. Israel is not the end goal, it’s only the beginning. We had no other choice but to act,” visually illustrated the range of Iran’s missiles. The map placed Iran at the centre, with concentric circles marking missile ranges of 300 km, 500 km, 800 km, 1,300 km, and 2,000 km, extending the threat to countries across the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and parts of Europe and Asia.The graphic was intended to emphasise that Iran’s missile capabilities are not just a threat to Israel but pose a wider regional and potentially global danger.However, a major flaw in the image was the incorrect depiction of India’s map. The map omitted Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, which are constitutionally integral parts of India. Aksai Chin, which is part of Ladakh, was also excluded from Indian territory. Arunachal Pradesh was also misrepresented in the map.Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply overnight as Iran launched missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and into early Saturday, in retaliation for Israel’s Operation ""Rising Lion.""The confrontation erupted after what Israeli officials described as the country’s ""greatest military operations in history"" against Iran.

Earlier on Friday morning, in a video message, he said Iran has reached a level of uranium enrichment that it could soon develop some nine atom bombs. He also cautioned citizens not to be in euphoria over the success of the operation and stay calm and vigilant. He asserted that there would be retaliation and may be ""a price"" to pay.Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"".

The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies. Britain and the US provided backup in the form of fighter jets, refuelling planes and air defence systems. Neighbouring Jordan confirmed it had shot down Iranian missiles and drones. Some West Asian states allowed Israel to transit their airspace.This time around, there was less understanding and more concern. Some European allies worried Israel was ratcheting up a conflict with Iran after eight months of simmering tensions but no overt warfare. ""Escalation serves no one in the region,"" PM Keir Starmer of Britain said, while EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the situation ""dangerous"". Those remarks followed a growing chorus of European condemnation of Israel over the past few months for escalating the war in Gaza. Some of the sharpest condemnation came from countries in the region. Egypt, which has a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, called the strikes ""a direct threat to regional and international peace and security"".Still, a number of key allies, including the US, stood behind Israel and expressed mounting frustration with Iran's advancing nuclear programme. And should Iran launch a powerful counterattack against Israel, allies could still come to the country's defence militarily.","The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies.

For four decades, Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a grand project: building up a network of anti-Israel militias known as the ""Axis of Resistance"" that would join Iran if a war with Israel broke out.Friday's strikes underscored just how degraded that axis has become over the past year, with few expecting those armed groups to meaningfully respond to the Israeli aggression, experts say. In the clearest sign of that weakened stance, Hezbollah , the Lebanese militant group seen as Iran's most powerful proxy, condemned the attack but stopped short of vowing military action in response - a notable omission from a group that has long served as the central pillar of the axis.The Houthis in Yemen also made no mention of responding militarily. ""The axis hasn't been fully destroyed, but it has been diminished beyond the point of return,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. ""It has been transformed into an axis of sitting ducks waiting for the next Israeli strikes rather than taking initiative and pushing Israel into the defence.""Iran also lost a key ally in Dec, after Syrian rebels, whom Hezbollah fought, toppled Bashar al-Assad's govt in Syria. Among Iran's proxies, still intact are Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and the Houthis. ""Now the Houthis are the most capable and forthcoming of the axis, but at the same time, (Israeli) strikes have had an impact on their capacity,"" said Ali.","Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a network of anti-Israel militias.

Israel sent Mossad agents deep into Iran: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-sent-mossad-agents-deep-into-iran-report/articleshow/121841328.cms,"Representative image





JERUSALEM: Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems during Israel’s attack on nuclear and military targets, an Israeli security source said, while another official said Israel used a ploy to suggest the strike was not imminent.The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into the attacks.Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday. Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran.Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes.M ossad even smuggled weapons into Iran. The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran. The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said were its operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.The decision to strike Iran was made Monday, the same day Netanyahu and Trump spoke, when Netanyahu, defence minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin Friday, said a second source. The final green light was given by Netanyahu’s security cabinet, which convened Thursday night.REUTERS","Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems, an Israeli security source said.

How it all started?



How world leaders reacted?







Iran struck back at Israel with a second wave of missiles on Saturday in retaliation to the latter's Operation Rising Lion that killed over 78 people and left 320 injured, according to Iran's UN ambassador.In a stark warning to Israel, Iranian military shared a video of the strikes saying, ""When the last sword strikes, we’ll see who remains.""The Israeli military issued a brief alert urging residents to seek shelter following the detection of new missile launches from Iran. ""A short while ago, sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles from Iran toward the State of Israel,"" the military said, adding that the air force was ""operating to intercept and strike where necessary to eliminate the threat"". Shortly after this, it announced that, based on a ""situational assessment,"" it was safe to leave shelters, though people were advised to stay close to them.Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a recorded address to the nation, said, ""Do not assume that they attacked and it's finished. No, they initiated the actions and began the conflict. We will not permit them to evade consequences for this significant wrongdoing they have perpetrated"".Israel’s emergency medical services reported that 34 individuals were injured in the missile barrage targeting the Tel Aviv area.The conflict was sparked by what has been described as Israel’s largest military operation in history against Iran. Israeli warplanes and drones on Thursday night—some allegedly pre-positioned within Iranian territory—carried out a massive, coordinated assault deep inside the country.The attacks targeted critical sites, including components of Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile facilities, and military command centers. Several high-ranking Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists were reportedly killed in the strike.In retaliation, Iran on Friday night launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv.US President Donald Trump urged Iran to 'make a deal' saying, ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!""Meanwhile, Prime minister Narendra Modi called for restoration of peace in the region saying, ""Received a phone call from PM @netanyahu of Israel. He briefed me on the evolving situation. I shared India's concerns and emphasized the need for early restoration of peace and stability in the region.""UK PM Keir Starmer also urged for de-escalation urging to return to diplomacy saying ""The reports of these strikes are concerning and we urge all parties to step back and reduce tensions urgently. Escalation serves no one in the region. Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy.""In a pointed response, Iran rejected the call for restraint saying, ""If you were silent during two years of Palestinian massacres and last night’s attack on Iran, don’t call for restraint now. Stay quiet.""","Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a recorded address to the nation, said, ""Do not assume that they attacked and it's finished.

20 top Iranian commanders killed in attacks: Reports





Iran was reeling on Friday from waves of Israeli strikes that decapitated its military chain of command and targeted a key nuclear facility, as US President Donald Trump urged Iran to strike a deal curbing its nuclear programme or risk ""even more brutal"" attacks.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu described the assault, which was brought about by deploying warplanes and drones smuggled into the country, as a last resort to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, which Israel views as an existential threat. Israel said the strikes were only the start of 'Operation Rising Lion'. The attacks also killed several top Iranian officials and six nuclear scientists and hit Iran's long-range missile facilities and aerial defences.As evening fell, Iranian media reported explosions on the northern and southern outskirts of Tehran and at Fordo, near the holy city of Qom, a second major nuclear site. Israel's military said it was striking Iranian missile and drone launching sites. Air defences were activated across Tehran and explosions could be heard in Isfahan, with Israel claiming it had struck the nuke site there. Iran said in retaliation ""the gates of hell will open"".On Friday night, explosions were heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as sirens sounded across Israel following what the country's military spokesman said was the firing of missiles from Iran.Iran's state news agency IRNA said hundreds of ballistic missiles had been launched, shortly after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised ""harsh punishment"". There were no immediate reports of casualties.Friday's strikes were the first time Israel successfully hit Iran's nuke facilities, including its main enrichment facility at Natanz, which an Israeli military spokesperson said had suffered ""significant damage.""Later Friday morning, the Israeli military announced that Iranian forces had fired about 100 drones at Israel, as Netanyahu vowed the fighting would last “as many days as it takes”. The Israeli military said it was working to intercept the Iranian attack, and there were no immediate indications of significant damage caused by the drones.Israel had told the Trump administration the largescale attacks were coming, officials in the US and Israel said.Iran confirmed Mohammad Bagheri, the commander-in-chief of the military and the second-highest commander after the supreme leader, was among those killed, as was Gen. Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Revolutionary Guard.Ali Shamkhani, a leading politician who was overseeing the nuclear talks with US, was also killed, officials said. Khamenei moved quickly to appoint some replacements, aiming to avoid the appearance of a leadership vacuum. In all, at least 20 senior commanders were killed, two regional sources said. The head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, was also reported to be among them.Residents of Tehran reported hearing huge explosions, and Iranian state television broadcast images of smoke and fire billowing from buildings. Long lines were forming at gas stations and grocery stores. Dozens were killed in Iran and more than 300 others injured, according to unofficial figures cited by the Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.In a televised message, President Masoud Pezeshkian urged Iranians to stand by their leaders and said a powerful response “will make Israel regret its foolish act”. Iran told the UNSC, due to meet on Friday at Tehran’s request, in a letter that it will respond decisively and proportionally to Israel’s “unlawful” and “cowardly” acts. Iran’s Nournews said 78 people had been killed and 329 injured in Israeli attacks on residential areas in Tehran.",Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu described the assault as a last resort to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.

Air patrols, base alerts amid escalation



Troop numbers rise amid Middle East crisis







American air-defence systems and naval assets played a key role in helping Israel intercept a barrage of ballistic missiles fired by Iran on Friday, a US official confirmed, as tensions between Tehran and Tel Aviv threaten to engulf the region in a wider war.The missile launches were in retaliation for Israel’s earlier airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and the killing of top military leaders. According to US officials, American Patriot missile-defence batteries and Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) systems stationed in the Middle East were activated as Iran launched multiple waves of missiles, including at Tel Aviv.Naval forces also assisted Israel’s response, though it remains unclear whether US ships fired interceptors or supported the effort with their advanced radar tracking systems. Officials said the Navy has ordered the USS Thomas Hudner, a destroyer equipped to counter ballistic missiles, to sail from the western to the eastern Mediterranean. A second destroyer is also being repositioned to provide additional options if requested by the White House.Meanwhile, the USS Carl Vinson, currently in the Arabian Sea, remains the only US aircraft carrier in the region, but other carriers—Nimitz in the Indo-Pacific and George Washington now departing Japan—could be directed toward the Middle East if needed.American fighter jets are now conducting air patrols across the region to protect US military personnel and installations. Air bases have increased security protocols as the US military prepares for any further escalation.President Donald Trump was briefed on the situation Friday in a meeting with his National Security Council, officials said, as forces on the ground braced for further fallout.The US has approximately 40,000 troops deployed in the Middle East—up from the typical 30,000—with numbers having peaked at 43,000 last October. This rise came amid a string of Iran-linked attacks, including Houthi strikes on vessels in the Red Sea and the October 7 Hamas assault on Israel that sparked the ongoing Gaza war.Following those attacks, then-President Joe Biden had surged naval power to the region in a show of deterrence aimed at Iran and Hezbollah. On October 1, 2024, US Navy destroyers launched a dozen interceptors as more than 200 missiles rained down on Israel from Iran.Friday’s interception efforts mark the latest demonstration of American military coordination with Israel amid deepening fears of a full-scale regional war.","US air-defence systems and naval assets played a key role in helping Israel intercept a barrage of ballistic missiles fired by Iran on Friday.
