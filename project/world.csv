NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday unleashed a scathing attack at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his remark that ""Rajas and Maharajas used to take away lands"" and accused him of appeasing a certain 'vote bank' while remaining silent on the atrocities committed by Muslim rulers.Speaking at a public meeting in Belagavi, Karnataka, PM Modi said, ""The Shehzada of the Congress said recently that our Rajas and Maharajas back in the day were ruthless.They snatched or took away the humble assets of the poor at their whim. The Shehzada insulted the revered Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Rani Chennamma, whose good governance and patriotism still fill us with national pride and honour. Does he not have any knowledge of the contribution of the royal family of Mysuru who we all regard very highly and are proud of?""The Prime Minister claimed that Rahul Gandhi's statement was carefully crafted to appease a specific vote bank, while ignoring the excesses and atrocities committed by Muslim emperors on their peasants.""The Shehzada's was carefully calibrated, on purpose, to appease a certain vote bank. He did not utter a single word on the atrocities committed by the Nawabs, Nizams, Sultans, and Badhshahs (on their peasants). The Congress seems to have forgotten the grave excesses perpetrated by (Mughal emperor) Aurangzeb, who destroyed thousands of our temples,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi highlighted the contributions of Hindu rulers and emperors, stating that Rahul Gandhi's primary concern is his 'vote bank'. He mentioned the establishment of Benaras Hindu University with the help of the local king and Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda's support for Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's higher education abroad. The Prime Minister also criticized the Congress for aligning with parties that glorify Aurangzeb and not discussing the rulers who destroyed and looted pilgrimage sites and killed people and livestock.Earlier, addressing a public meeting in Karnataka, Rahul said, ""Many Rajas, Maharajas ruled us back in the day. They did whatever they wished and took away the land of their peasants at will. It was the Congress and its workers who, along with freedom fighters, brought us independence from our oppressors and restored democracy and the rule of law to the country.""The Prime Minister also went on to target the Congress over the deteriorating law and order situation in Karnataka since they came to power. He referred to the daylight murder of a Congress corporator's daughter in Hubballi.Neha (23), the daughter of Congress councillor of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation, Niranjan Hiremath, was stabbed to death on the campus of BVB College on April 18.The Prime Minister accused the Congress of prioritizing appeasement over justice when the bereaved family sought action, stating that they do not value the lives of daughters like Neha (Hiremath) and only care about their vote bank.Meanwhile, the Congress hit back at Prime Minister over his ""insulted maharajas but silent on atrocities of sultans"" attack on Rahul Gandhi, saying he ""maliciously twists"" every statement of the former Congress chief to inflame communal prejudices and passions.""He maliciously and mischievously twists every statement of Rahul Gandhi to inflame, incite and ignite communal prejudices and passions,"" Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.""His (Modi's) exit is inevitable and his realisation of that is making him more and more desperate. His campaign speeches are shameful really,"" Ramesh said.(With agency inputs)","Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his remark that ""Rajas and Maharajas used to take away lands"" He accused him of appeasing a certain 'vote bank' while remaining silent on the atrocities committed by Muslim rulers.

Argentine prez's attachment to dead pet dog raises sanity worry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/argentine-prezs-attachment-to-dead-pet-dog-raises-sanity-worry/articleshow/109671925.cms,"Does Javier Milei communicate with a ghost dog whose death he refuses to accept? Forced to respond to questions about his mental health , the Argentine prez 's office has lashed out at ""disrespectful"" speculation. Twice last week, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni was asked about Milei's English Mastiff, Conan, said to have died seven years ago. Milei, 53, had Conan cloned, and today is believed to own four copies he refers to as ""four-legged children"".Or is it five? The prez himself referred in an interview with CNN this month to his five dogs, whose faces and names he had engraved on the presidential baton. Conan, Milton, Murray, Robert and Lucas were also among the first Milei thanked after his election victory last Aug. Yet, only four mastiffs have ever been seen in photos with Milei. Adorni was asked if Milei has four dogs - but sees five - and if so, whether he can be said to have a firm grip on reality. Milei raised eyebrows on the campaign trail by occasionally dressing up as a superhero alter-ego ""Captain Ancap"" - short for anarcho-capitalist.A gold watch found on the body of the richest passenger on the Titanic was auctioned in England for £1.17 million ($1.46m) on Saturday. It was a record sum for an object linked to the 1912 shipping disaster, said the auctioneers. A US buyer won the bidding war. The watch belonged to the US business magnate John Jacob Astor. At 47, he was reputed to be one of the richest men in the world at the time. He died after having helped his wife on board one of the lifeboats.","Javier Milei's office lashes out at ""disrespectful"" speculation about his mental health.

The US military has yet to comment on the incident, but CBS News confirmed the crash of an MQ-9 inside Yemen, sparking an ongoing investigation, according to Al Jazeera.This marks the third US drone shot down by the Houthis since the outset of the conflict in Gaza, with previous incidents occurring in November and February. Despite this, the Houthis have remained silent on further attacks against vessels in nearby waters, although the US military reported anti-ship missiles being fired at the MV MAISH, a vessel flying the Antigua/Barbados flag.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) confirmed two attacks on a vessel, likely the MV Andromeda Star, near al-Mukha (Mocha) in Yemen. The first explosion occurred in close proximity to the vessel, followed by a second attack involving two missiles, resulting in damage.The Houthi military's recent activity follows their claim of targeting the ""Israeli ship MSC Darwin"" in the Gulf of Aden and launching missiles and drones at targets in Israel's southern port city of Eilat.

Tory rift sparks 'Op Save Rishi': Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tory-rift-sparks-op-save-rishi-report/articleshow/109671976.cms,"Rishi Sunak said this week he's putting UK defence spending on a "" war footing ."" He might as well have been talking about his own position.Allies of the UK PM described the last few days as him entering campaign mode for a general election he must call by the end of Jan. A plan to tighten rules for welfare payments, ramming his flagship policy to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda through parliament and a pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030 all secured newspaper front-page coverage.An aide characterised the tempo shift as ""Operation Save Rishi"" ahead of a more immediate test, as the Conservative Party gears up for local council and mayoral elections Thursday. Sunak's internal Tory critics have warned that any result suggesting the opposition Labour Party is marching to office would trigger efforts to oust him. The recent flurry of activity was in part about getting Sunak through next week without a leadership challenge, members of his team said on condition of anonymity.The Tories are defending just under 1,000 seats from the last vote in 2021, when the party was boosted by the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine. The party's national support has slumped since, and Labour's 20-point lead in the polls could translate to a loss of half of those seats. Yet there's even more focus on the outcome of two mayoral races, in the West Midlands and Tees Valley in northern England, where Tories Andy Street and Ben Houchen are battling to stay in their roles. Both are seen as a figureheads for recent Conservative inroads into traditional Labour areas, and losing both would be seen by many in the party as a bellwether for a national defeat. A group of Tories, who claim to have been gathering support for a leadership change, are waiting for a moment to act. They are proposing House of Commons member Penny Mordaunt as their preferred candidate, and are sharing polling with other MPs showing she's viewed favourably by public. But a Mordaunt ally said she wouldn't quit after May 2 votes or call for leadership change, a position that appears to bolster Sunak's position.","Allies of the UK PM described the last few days as him entering campaign mode for a general election he must call by the end of Jan.

How Iran avoided escalation with Israel through quick military maneuvering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-iran-avoided-escalation-with-israel-through-quick-military-maneuvering/articleshow/109586561.cms,"By swiftly replacing the radar, Iran aimed to maintain its defensive posture and readiness, at least in appearance, to deter further Israeli strikes.

The replacement allowed Iranian propagandists to claim operational readiness and resilience, thereby managing domestic and international perceptions.

Most critically, by not responding further and instead quickly repairing the site, Iran avoided a potential escalation that could have drawn in more regional players and possibly led to a full-scale war.

Khamenei tacitly acknowledges that Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel

In a recent flare-up between Iran and Israel, where both nations exchanged missile and drone strikes, tensions soared, hinting at the potential for a broader conflict. However, the situation de-escalated as quickly as it escalated, with Iran making a strategic move to replace a destroyed air defense radar, thus avoiding further provocation and managing to save face on the international stage, a report in the Economist said.On April 13, for the first time in its history, Iran directly launched a barrage of drones and missiles toward an Israeli air base, which was met with a precise Israeli counterstrike.In response, the Israeli missiles on April 19 targeted and destroyed a critical piece of Iranian air defense, the 30n6e2 ""Tombstone"" radar , located near the heavily fortified Natanz nuclear complex. This radar is essential for tracking incoming air threats and guiding interceptor missiles.Following the Israeli retaliation, new satellite imagery analyzed by Chris Biggers, a former imagery analyst at America’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, revealed that Iran had swiftly replaced the destroyed ""Tombstone"" radar with a different model, the 96l6e ""Cheese board"" radar. This radar was placed in the exact location of the previous one, and the missile launchers appeared ready for action. Biggers noted that this switch was likely a tactic of ""denial and deception,"" aimed at portraying the site as still operational, despite the replacement radar's incompatibility with the existing defense system, the Economist report said.This quick substitution by Iran served multiple strategic purposes:Meanwhile, during a meeting with Iran's top military leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran's supreme leader, downplayed the effectiveness of a significant drone-and-missile attack on Israel, subtly admitting that the assault didn't achieve its intended impact. Despite the substantial scale of the attack, Khamenei emphasized that the number of missiles that hit their targets was not a priority.Khamenei's remarks, which were broadcast on state television, came in the context of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, particularly as conflicts continue in the Gaza Strip. He said, “Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn’t, these are of secondary importance. The main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation and Iranian military’s will in an important international arena. This is what matters.”(With inputs from agencies)","Iran quickly replaced a destroyed air defense radar, avoiding further provocation and managing to save face on the international stage.

NEW DELHI: Pro-Palestine, anti-war protests have gained momentum across universities in the US leading to the arrest of hundreds of students at Columbia University among others.The University of Southern California on Thursday cancelled its graduation ceremony, and dozens more college students were detained on other campuses throughout the country.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was also arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests .The protesting students are asking that institutions cut their financial ties with Israel and divest from firms that they believe are aiding the Gaza conflict.Last week, pro-Palestinian student demonstrators set up a tent encampment at New York's Ivy League universities. Police attempted to evict the encampment on April 18, arresting over 100 demonstrators. However, the approach backfired, energizing students around the country and prompting demonstrators at Columbia to regroup.On Wednesday, university administrators announced that they were extending the time for demonstrators to clear out. They said the demonstrators had agreed to remove a large number of tents and that only students would remain at the encampment. They also decided to prohibit all racist language and harassing messages.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests. Coimbatore-born Achinthya Sivalingan is facing disciplinary action, a university spokesperson said.Protesters put up tents for a student-led pro-Palestine encampment in McCosh Courtyard around 7am on Thursday. Following warnings from University officials, two Princeton students were arrested, while the remaining protestors packed up their camping gear and resumed the action as a sit-in, according to the Princeton Alumni Weekly.US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Friday that viewpoints should be expressed in a 'peaceful' manner, emphasizing that 'nobody should feel threatened'.""It's the moment, you know, having a lot of discord in the world. And we in America believe opinions should be expressed, but nobody should feel threatened. If anything goes over the line where somebody feels individually threatened. That's something that's unacceptable, and there will be consequences,"" Envoy Garcetti told ANI.""At the same time, people do have that right to express their opinions, their differences in a peaceful manner, in a way where we can agree to disagree, agree, or we can respect each other's different opinions. And that's, I think, the goal for all of us,"" he added.As protests raged around campus, the University of Southern California canceled its graduation ceremony. The institution has previously canceled the graduating address of the school's pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns.According to the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 90 persons were arrested Wednesday night for allegedly trespassing during a university demonstration. One person has been arrested for alleged assault with a deadly weapon.To avoid demonstrations, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sealed most of the gates to its famed Harvard Yard before classes began Monday and restricted entrance to those with school identification.The school also erected banners telling students not to set up tents or tables on campus without permission. Despite these efforts, protesters set up a 14-tent camp on Wednesday, following a march protesting the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.On Thursday, Boston Police said that 108 persons were arrested at an Emerson College encampment. According to police, four officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.Earlier this week, at New York University, a student-led encampment grew to hundreds of demonstrators. On Wednesday, police reported they had arrested 133 protestors. They stated everyone was freed with a summons to appear in court on disorderly behavior charges.","Indian-origin student arrested in US, barred from varsity for taking part in protests.

'Asking for trouble': Why Japanese academics are shunning China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/asking-for-trouble-why-japanese-academics-are-shunning-china/articleshow/109640702.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Japanese academics are increasingly hesitant to attend events in China following the unexplained disappearance of Fan Yuntao , a 61-year-old expert in international law and politics based at Tokyo’s Asia University. Fan, who was last in contact with his family in April last year, reportedly told them he was being taken for questioning by Chinese government officials, according to Kyodo News.The unsettling incident is part of a troubling pattern involving several Chinese academics based in Japan, including Hu Shiyun and Zhu Jianrong, who have also vanished under mysterious circumstances.These cases have prompted fears among the academic community, leading to a decline in participation in academic events in China, a South China Morning Post report said.Fan’s university has confirmed that he is on leave but has refrained from providing further details to protect personal data. His disappearance has sparked significant criticism of the Japanese government’s passive approach, with social media users and academics alike decrying the lack of action.Yoichi Shimada, a professor of international relations at Fukui Prefectural University, expressed his reluctance to travel to China, citing the absence of assurances for his safe return. “There seems to be no clear reason for these arrests. It is impossible for me and other academics to go there now,” Shimada said.The issue also affects Japanese businesspeople and members of the Chinese diaspora who been arrested after returning to China. Jeff Kingston, an American director of Asian Studies at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, acknowledged the risks but noted his lower profile might spare him from such threats.Critics argue that Japan's response to these incidents is insufficient, particularly in light of Beijing’s new anti-espionage laws that have intensified fears of wrongful detention. Shimada further criticized the Japanese government’s ineffectiveness, stating, “I have no faith that the Japanese government would do much to get me home if I was accused of something; they are weak-kneed when it comes to China.”This situation highlights a growing concern over academic freedom and safety among Japanese scholars regarding engagement with Chinese institutions amid escalating geopolitical tensions.","Japanese academics are increasingly hesitant to attend events in China following the unexplained disappearance of Fan Yuntao.

Since then, humanitarian aid to Gaza has increased substantially, but still not as much as is needed.Under the US-sponsored ceasefire proposal, Israel would halt hostilities for six weeks and release hundreds of Palestinians held in its prisons in exchange for the release of 40 hostages held by Hamas, mainly women, older men and those with health conditions. Later stages of the deal would then extend ceasefire and result in more hostages being freed.","Biden's call came just hours after secretary of state Antony Blinken left Washington for his latest trip to West Asia.

Just minutes into his speech at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner Saturday, Biden launched into the issues dominating the 2024 election , including his age and former Prez Donald Trump 's hush-money trial in New York.""The 2024 election's in full swing and yes, age is an issue,"" Biden said in a roughly 10-minute speech.""I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.""""Donald has had a few tough days lately. You might call it 'stormy' weather,"" Biden said, an oblique reference to Stormy Daniels, a porn actor who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006 and received a hush-money payment in the days before the 2016 election, a deal at the centre of his New York trial. The comments were notable given Biden has forbidden his aides from talking about Trump's legal troubles.While he rarely mentioned Trump by name early in his presidency, Biden has aggressively taunted him as of late and kept it going Saturday. ""Age is the only thing we have in common,"" Biden, 81, said of Trump, 77. ""My vice-president actually endorses me,"" he said, referring to former vice-president Mike Pence's decision not to endorse Trump.Biden also used his speech at the dinner to warn about his political opponent's threats on democracy - increasingly a focus of his message to voters. ""Focus on what's actually at stake,"" he said. ""The stakes couldn't be higher.""The century-old event, often referred to as Washington's ""nerd prom"", provided a break to journalists and govt officials from their normal jousting for a night of glitz and gossip in celebration of the free press.

As journalists and politicians arrived at the hotel, pro-Palestinian protesters chanted, ""Shame on you!"" Other protesters wearing press vests with the names of more than 100 Palestinian journalists who have been killed in Gaza lay down in front of the dinner venue.Colin Jost, the co-anchor of ""Weekend Update"" on ""Saturday Night Live"", spent roughly 23 minutes poking fun at the prez. But Jost's speech was relatively light, even supportive of Biden. He ended it by noting that his grandfather, who recently died, had voted for Biden in the last election. ""The reason he voted for you is because you're a decent man,"" he said.Trump reacted to the event by calling it ""really bad"" in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Alwan and other students were being suspended after their arrests at the “ Gaza Solidarity Encampment,” a tactic colleges across the country have deployed to calm growing campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war.The students' plight has become a central part of protests, with students and a growing number of faculty demanding their amnesty . At issue is whether universities and law enforcement will clear the charges and withhold other consequences, or whether the suspensions and legal records will follow students into their adult lives.Terms of the suspensions vary from campus to campus. At Columbia and its affiliated Barnard College for women, Alwan and dozens more were arrested April 18 and promptly barred from campus and classes, unable to attend in-person or virtually, and banned from dining halls.Questions about their academic futures remain. Will they be allowed to take final exams? What about financial aid? Graduation? Columbia says outcomes will be decided at disciplinary hearings, but Alwan says she has not been given a date.“This feels very dystopian,” said Alwan, a comparative literature and society major.What started at Columbia has turned into a nationwide showdown between students and administrators over anti-war protests and the limits offree speech . In the past 10 days, hundreds of students have been arrested, suspended, put on probation and, in rare cases, expelled from colleges including Yale University, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt University and the University of Minnesota.Barnard, a women's liberal arts college at Columbia, suspended more than 50 students who were arrested April 18 and evicted them from campus housing, according to interviews with students and reporting from the Columbia Spectator campus newspaper, which obtained internal campus documents.On Friday, Barnard announced it had reached agreements restoring campus access to “nearly all” of them. A statement from the college did not specify the number but said all students who had their suspensions lifted have agreed to follow college rules and, in some cases, were put on probation.On the night of the arrests, however, Barnard student Maryam Iqbal posted a screenshot on the social media platform X of a dean's email telling her she could briefly return to her room with campus security before getting kicked out.“You will have 15 minutes to gather what you might need,” the email read.More than 100 Barnard and Columbia faculty staged a “Rally to Support Our Students” last week condemning the student arrests and demanding suspensions be lifted.Columbia is still pushing to remove the tent encampment on the campus main lawn where graduation is set to be hosted May 15. The students have demanded the school cuts ties with Israel-linked companies and ensure amnesty for students and faculty arrested or disciplined in connection with the protests.Talks with the student protesters are continuing, said Ben Chang, a Columbia spokesperson. “We have our demands; they have theirs,” he said.For international students facing suspension, there is the added fear of losing their visas, said Radhika Sainath, an attorney with Palestine Legal, which helped a group of Columbia students file a federal civil rights complaint against the school Thursday. It accuses Columbia of not doing enough to address discrimination against Palestinian students.“The level of punishment is not even just draconian, it feels like over-the-top callousness,” Sainath said.More than 40 students were arrested at a Yale demonstration last week, including senior Craig Birckhead-Morton. He is due to graduate May 20 but says the university has not yet told him if his case will be submitted to a disciplinary panel. He worries about whether he will receive a diploma and if his acceptance to Columbia graduate school could be at risk.“The school has done its best to ignore us and not tell us what happens next,” said Birckhead-Morton, a history major.Across the country, college administrators have struggled to balance free speech and inclusivity. Some demonstrations have included hate speech, antisemitic threats or support for Hamas, the group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking a war in Gaza that has left more than 34,000 dead.May commencement ceremonies add pressure to clear demonstrations. University officials say arrests and suspensions are a last resort, and that they give ample warnings beforehand to clear protest areas.Vanderbilt University in Tennessee has issued what are believed to be the only student expulsions related to protesting the Israel-Hamas conflict , according to the Institute for Middle Eastern Understanding. More than two dozen students occupied the university chancellor’s office for several hours on March 26, prompting the university to summon police and arrest several protesters. Vanderbilt then issued three expulsions, one suspension and put 22 protesters on probation.In an open letter to Chancellor Daniel Diermeier, more than 150 Vanderbilt professors criticized the university’s crackdown as “excessive and punitive.”Freshman Jack Petocz, 19, one of those expelled, is being allowed to attend classes while he appeals. He has been evicted from his dorm and is living off campus.Petocz said protesting in high school was what helped get him into Vanderbilt and secure a merit scholarship for activists and organizers. His college essay was about organizing walkouts in rural Florida to oppose Gov. Ron DeSantis’ anti-LGBTQ policies.“Vanderbilt seemed to love that,” Petocz said. “Unfortunately, the buck stops when you start advocating for Palestinian liberation.”","Hundreds of students have been arrested, suspended, put on probation and, in rare cases, expelled from colleges.

NEW DELHI: At least two individuals, including a child, lost their lives in tornadoes that swept through Oklahoma , Officials mentioned on Sunday as emergency teams were evaluating the extensive destruction to residences and establishments caused by the strong winds, hail, and flooding.Dozens of tornadoes have caused chaos in the central part of the country since Friday, leading to flood alerts and advisories being issued on Sunday for Oklahoma and neighboring states such as Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas.A tornado tore through Holdenville in Oklahoma, a town with approximately 5,000 residents, on late Saturday, resulting in the deaths of two individuals and injuries to four others, as reported by Hughes County Emergency Medical Services.Holdenville is located approximately 80 miles (128.75 kilometers) away from Oklahoma City.Gov. Kevin Stitt said, ""My prayers are with those who lost loved ones as tornadoes ripped through Oklahoma last night.""He issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in 12 counties as a result of the aftermath of the severe weather. Rescue teams were engaged in clearing debris and evaluating the damage caused by the intense storms that knocked down power lines.As of Sunday morning, nearly 33,000 customers in Oklahoma were experiencing power outages, as reported by power outage, a platform that monitors electrical service disruptions, while Texas had almost 67,000 customers without electricity. Substantial damage from the storm was documented in the southern Oklahoma town of Sulphur, where officials also noted unspecified injuries.The Murray County Sheriff's Office advised individuals to avoid the city in order to facilitate the access of emergency personnel, given the extensive damage caused by tornadoes. This information was shared through a statement on the agency's Facebook page.""Stay home and do not come to look,"" the sheriff's office said.The tornado damage began on Friday afternoon close to Lincoln, Nebraska. An industrial structure in Lancaster County was struck, resulting in its collapse with seventy individuals present inside.
