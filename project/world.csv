'Mindless killing changed everything': How Bangladesh's quota protests ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mindless-killing-changed-everything-how-bangladeshs-quota-protests-ended-sheikh-hasinas-15-year-reign/articleshow/112295042.cms,"Driving the news

In a broadcast to the nation on state television, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief of Bangladesh, announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government .

. Dressed in military fatigues, Waker said, ""The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence.""

This announcement came shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's residence.

In Dhaka, demonstrators scaled a monument dedicated to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the current Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the founding father of Bangladesh. Once atop the statue, the protesters proceeded to use an axe to forcefully remove and damage the sculpted head of the revered figure.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar met PM Narendra Modi and briefed him developments in Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, Hasina reached India aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C-130J military transport aircraft, PTI reported quoting sources.

It remains uncertain whether the military transport plane will carry her onward from India or if she will switch to another aircraft for her journey to London, the PTI report said.

Why it matters

With over 32 million young people out of work or education in Bangladesh, the protests have tapped into widespread frustration over limited opportunities and economic challenges.

The absence of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh's political landscape may exacerbate the country's already precarious situation.

Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated countries, faces high levels of unemployment, pervasive corruption, and the dire consequences of climate change. These crises have already placed a significant strain on the nation, and the departure of its leader could further compound these issues.

Zoom in

The unrest began in July 2024 when students initiated demonstrations demanding the abolition of a government job quota system that allocated a significant percentage of positions to the descendants of war veterans from the 1971 independence conflict.

The protests intensified after the high court reinstated a 30% job quota for the families of freedom fighters, sparking widespread outrage among students and young professionals who argue that the quotas perpetuate inequality and hinder merit-based hiring.

The government's attempt to reduce the quota to 5% failed to quell the unrest, with demonstrators demanding the complete abolition of the quota system.

The situation escalated dramatically on August 4, 2024 as violent confrontations erupted between protesters and supporters of the ruling Awami League , Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists.

, Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists. The protesters were mainly organized by the Students Against Discrimination, with the sole demand of Hasina's resignation over the job quota system.

So far, over 300 have died in these protests since July.

'Mindless killing changed everything'

What they are saying

""The country is going through a revolutionary period. ""I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,"" the Bangladesh army chief said.

""I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,"" Zaman added. ""Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.""

""15 consecutive years of power have been shattered by a people’s revolution. In the end, the Iron Lady had feet of clay,"" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

""Bangladesh has achieved its second independence now,"" Abu Sayem told Reuters in Whitechapel, a London neighbourhood home to a large Bangladeshi community . ""We actually got our independence first in 1971 but autocrat Sheikh Hasina was ruling the country forcibly. She has snatched away our rights. She has killed thousands of children.""

What it means for India

Under Hasina, Bangladesh has emerged as one of the most trusted allies of India in South Asia.

Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the former foreign secretary of India, expressed concerns that an unstable Bangladesh could contribute to instability in certain regions of India.

""An unstable Bangladesh can add to instability in parts of our country, which we do not want to see. So, a peaceful, prosperous, stable Bangladesh is India's best. It is very important that we work with all concerned to ensure that our interests and those of Bangladesh are secured,"" Shringla told ANI.

Shringla expressed confidence that Indian representatives would engage with the relevant individuals in Bangladesh to protect India's broader interests and constructively promote peace and stability in the region.

""We have strong ties across the board in a multifaceted manner in Bangladeshi society. And, we will engage any political or any other organization that we need to in the furtherance of our larger interests and those of Bangladesh,"" he said.

What's next

The Hasina chapter seems to be over for Bangladesh. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, told BBC that there would be no political come back for her. She was ""so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her,"" Joy said.

Hasina's departure ""would leave a major vacuum"" and that the country was in ""uncharted territory"". ""The coming days are critical, as it moves toward what will hopefully be a peaceful transition,"" Kugelman said.

""The key now is to move the process along, to create the interim set-up, to ease uncertainty and reduce the risk of more volatility.""

Now, all eyes will now be on the army chief.

Bangladesh was thrown into turmoil on Monday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down from her position and left the nation. Her resignation followed a brutal suppression of protests that had escalated from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-scale movement calling for her removal from power. The crackdown resulted in the deaths of hundreds of individuals.The violent crackdown on protesters, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, fueled anger and resentment.""The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop,"" said Mahfuz Anam in column ""Mindless killing changed everything"" published in Daily Star.(With inputs from agencies)","Bangladesh's army chief announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government.

The attackers, suspected to be from the West Papua Liberation Army , released the Indigenous Papuan passengers — a stark contrast to the fate of the pilot, Glen Malcolm Conning , whose life was brutally cut short in the remote village of Alama.Conning, employed by the Indonesian aviation company PT Intan Angkasa Air Service, had just touched down in the mountainous district of Mimika, Central Papua province , when the ambush occurred, accoring to AP. The assailants, who reportedly belong to the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement, wasted no time in setting fire to the helicopter after executing the pilot. The passengers, two health workers and two children, were spared, likely due to their local ties, police said.Faizal Ramadhani, a member of Indonesia’s National Police and the head of the joint security peace force in Papua, confirmed the pilot’s death and the attackers' swift retreat into the dense jungle. “All passengers were safe because they were local residents of Alama village,” Ramadhani said as quoted by AP. He also said that the village's isolated nature, accessible only by air.The West Papua Liberation Army, through spokesperson Sebby Sambom, neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack. Sambom issued a chilling warning to foreign pilots, saying, “if that happens, it was his own fault for entering our forbidden territory...if anyone disobeys, they must bear the risk themselves.”The incident has cast a shadow over the already tense relations between Indigenous Papuans and Indonesian authorities. The region, rich in minerals but fraught with conflict, has long been a flashpoint for violence. This attack is the latest in a series of deadly encounters, including the ongoing abduction of New Zealand pilot Philip Mark Mehrtens by the same rebel group since February 2023.New Zealand's foreign ministry expressed concern over the incident, with the embassy in Jakarta seeking further details.

As Tropical Storm Debby continues to wreak havoc across the southeastern United States, the storm has brought unprecedented rainfall, deadly winds, and widespread flooding . The storm, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane, has already resulted in multiple deaths, mass evacuations, and significant damage across Florida, Georgia , and the Carolinas.Authorities are racing against time to rescue residents from flooded homes, particularly in Sarasota, Florida, and Manatee County, where hundreds have been rescued. The storm's path has brought it into Georgia and is expected to stall, bringing even more rainfall and potential catastrophic flooding to the region.The storm has since weakened to a tropical storm but continues to pose a significant threat, particularly to low-lying areas along the Eastern seaboard. As emergency services scramble to respond, the full impact of Debby’s wrath is still unfolding.The storm has led to at least 5 confirmed deaths, including a 19-year-old man who was killed in Moultrie, Georgia, when a tree fell on a porch. In Florida, a 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell on a mobile home. Additionally, a truck driver was killed in Tampa after losing control of his vehicle in the storm.Approximately 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, while 186 were saved in nearby Manatee County. Local officials described the event as unprecedented.Record rainfall, with up to 30 inches expected in some areas, has triggered flash flood emergencies, particularly in central and northern Florida.Over 300,000 people are without power in Florida and Georgia, with extensive efforts underway to restore electricity amid dangerous conditions.North Carolina and Georgia have also declared states of emergency, bracing for the storm's impact.Over 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide, with Florida airports being the most affected.Charleston, South Carolina, has imposed a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday due to expected heavy rainfall, with officials preparing for possible severe flooding.US President Joe Biden has authorized emergency declarations for South Carolina and Florida, and Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a planned trip to Georgia due to the storm.Debby is expected to continue moving northeast, with forecasted rainfalls of up to 30 inches in some areas. The storm surge and flash flooding remain major concerns as the storm lingers over the region.Debby’s landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, came less than a year after Hurricane Idalia struck the same area as a Category 3 storm, adding to the region’s ongoing struggles with severe weather.As Debby continues its path, local and federal authorities are urging residents to stay safe and heed warnings, with the full impact of the storm still unfolding.","Tropical Storm Debby continues to wreak havoc across the southeastern United States.

Hammers on Mujibur statue

Crowd enters parliament

66 killed on Monday, toll 366

Thousands of protesters in Bangladesh on Monday looted and vandalised Sheikh Hasina ’s official residence in the capital Dhaka , smashed a statue of her father Mujibur Rahman with hammers and set her party’s offices on fire as they celebrated her departure.Hasina, 76, resigned as PM and left Bangladesh amid mass protests against her govt over a controversial quota system that reserved 30% of govt jobs for the families of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence against Pakistan in 1971.She had been governing the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009.Thousands of protesters defied a military curfew and stormed her official residence ‘Ganabhaban’ in Dhaka. Video footage showed jubilant crowds vandalising and ransacking the premises, taking away even fish, chicken and vegetables. Bangladesh’s Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into Hasina’s compound, grinning and waving to the camera, looting furniture and books, or relaxing on beds. One protester proudly proclaimed to the media that he had taken a red lipstick. “I will keep it as a memento of our struggle… to remember we broke free from a dictator. She used to wear this lipstick,” he said. Another man carrying a planter said, “This is freedom.” Demonstrators also posed for pictures with the PM’s menagerie, including chickens, ducks and rabbits.Footage on social media showed protesters climbing a statue of Hasina’s father in Ganabhaban and smashing it with hammers. The Bangabandhu memorial museum — dedicated to Mujibur Rahman who was assassinated along with his wife and their three sons while serving as prez in 1975 — was also vandalised. Hasina and her sister had survived the purge as they were abroad. Hasina then spent six years in exile in India. The home of Wajed Miah, Hasina’s husband, was not spared.The Awami League office in the capital was also set on fire. Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan’s house was ransacked. A Prothom Alo reporter said screams could be heard when several people entered the chief justice’s residence. The crowd also entered the parliament building. People were seen taking things from inside the parliament building. A large number of protesters broke through the main gate of the police headquarters and ransacked the building.An unruly mob vandalised the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre in the city’s Dhanmondi area. Four Hindu temples suffered “minor” damages across the country, eyewitnesses said.At least 66 people were killed Monday, police said, saying gangs had launched revenge attacks on Hasina’s allies. Many were shot. The latest violence took the total number of people killed since protests began to at least 366, according to an AFP tally based on police, govt officials and doctors at hospitals.The violence was not restricted to Dhaka. In the eastern city of Sylhet, offices of the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police were set on fire, while the homes of several councillors were attacked, BBC reported. At least eight people were burned to death and 84 others suffered injuries after arsonists torched a hotel owned by Awami League general secretary of Jashore district.","Thousands of protesters defied a military curfew and stormed her official residence ‘Ganabhaban’ in Dhaka.

His father-in-law was army chief during the first of Hasina's five terms, from 1996 to 2001.The army has been at the centre of political upheavals earlier too. In 1981, Gen Ziaur Rahman, who took the president's office following coups, was assassinated, allegedly by a faction of army officers.

The group of nine staffers fired on Monday includes individuals from both groups, although the total number of staffers fired from the agency remains unclear. Haq affirmed that the UN had sufficient information to take action against the nine individuals.When questioned whether the UN's decision suggests that the nine individuals were ""likely or highly likely"" to have been involved in the attacks, the spokesperson responded affirmatively, saying, ""That's a good way of describing it.""The UN's internal watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, has been investigating UNRWA since January, when Israel accused 12 staffers of being involved in the October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the death of 1,200 people and the abduction of approximately 250 others. The allegations initially led top donor countries to suspend their funding for UNRWA, causing a cash crunch of around $450 million. Since then, all donor countries, except for the US, have decided to resume funding.Oren Marmorstein, the spokesperson for Israel's ministry of foreign affairs, called for donor countries to once again suspend funding, stating that ""the funds may go to terrorist elements."" He further added, ""UNRWA is part of the problem and not part of the solution, and anyone who seeks the best interests of Israel, the Gaza Strip and the region should act to replace UNWRA's activities with other agencies.""The UN watchdog responsible for investigating UNRWA relied on evidence provided by Israel in discussions with Israeli authorities but could not independently corroborate the evidence due to a lack of direct access. The investigators also reviewed internal UNRWA information, ultimately finding sufficient evidence pointing to the potential involvement of nine employees in the October 7 attack.Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, said in a statement, ""I have decided that in the case of these remaining nine staff members, they cannot work for UNRWA."" He emphasized the agency's priority to continue providing lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region, particularly in the face of the ongoing war, instability, and risk of regional escalation. Lazzarini also condemned the October 7 attack.""Your 'relief' agency has officially stooped to a new level of low, and it is time that the world sees your true face,"" Lieutenant-Colonel Nadav Shoshani, the international spokesperson for the Israeli army, said in a statement posted on X.UNRWA has been the main agency providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza during the 10-month-old conflict, which Gaza Health officials report has caused over 39,600 deaths and a massive humanitarian crisis. Throughout the conflict, Israel has called for the agency's closure, accusing it of collaborating with Hamas and ignoring militant activities. UNRWA denied collaborating with Hamas, stating that over 200 UNRWA staffers have been killed and 190 of its installations damaged during the conflict, including UN-run schools converted into shelters for displaced Palestinians.","UN terminates nine more staff members from its agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.

Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance in a podcast spoke how he was chosen as the VP pick by the GOP after 18 months of being a Senator and said that during the vetting process, he was asked by a lawyer whether he had a secret family -- another spouse apart from Usha Chilukuri Vance. JD said his wife was sitting there and three children were sleeping upstairs when the lawyer said he had to ask an intrusive question.""I was like, 'Are you serious?' Do I have a secret family? Like, what do you mean? He said sometimes you know people have another spouse, other kids in a place like Alaska,"" Vance said.""Oh by the way, if I did I am not gonna admit it in front of my wife. It's one of those questions where if you got to that point in your life that you are such a dishonest person and have a secret family in Alaska, I think they would hide it.

Because of the ongoing vetting process, he knew he was one of the candidates Trump was shortlisting but the moment it was decided, he was on a plane to Milwaukee without Wi-Fi and on landing, he saw 350 messages.In the hotel room, when JD finally had a chance to talk to Trump, Trump mentioned, ""JD, you missed a crucial phone call, and now I’ll need to choose someone else."" JD explained that his son was incessantly talking about Pikachu at that moment. ""I told him, 'Son, be quiet for 30 seconds... I have the most important call of my life...'"" JD added that Trump overheard the conversation and asked him to put the phone on speaker so his son could hear the news. Trump read the statement and asked JD’s son for his opinion.

Carillo’s reaction:

A Virginia man has been charged with making a series of violent death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris , just days after she was declared the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.Frank Lucio Carillo, 45, from Winchester, Virginia, was arrested on Friday and appeared in US District Court in Roanoke on Monday to face a federal felony charge that could land him up to five years in prison.The FBI's investigation revealed a disturbing pattern of threats emanating from Carillo’s account on the social media platform GETTR . Authorities discovered nearly 20 violent threats directed at Harris, including explicit threats to kill her and her family, along with horrific plans to inflict severe physical harm. One of the posts from July 27 read, “Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive. I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.”Carillo, using the GETTR account ""joemadarats1,"" made a total of 4,359 posts and replies targeting various public figures, including President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and other officials. The FBI linked this account to Carillo through their investigation.Besides Harris, Carillo’s threats extended to other officials and groups. He had posted about firearms and shooting people, and expressed violent intentions toward various targets, including Muslims and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.During the search of Carillo’s home, federal agents seized a pistol, an AR-15 assault rifle, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Carillo had boasted about his AR-15 being “LOCKED AND LOADED” in a February post.GETTR, the platform where Carillo made these threats, is a conservative social media site created as an alternative to mainstream platforms. It has been associated with right-wing users and was launched by Trump ally Jason Miller. The site has faced its share of controversies and legal issues.This case highlights a troubling trend of increasing threats against public officials. The U.S. Capitol Police reported over 8,000 threats against members of Congress last year, a significant rise from previous years.After his arrest, Carillo reportedly questioned the severity of the situation, asking, “This is all over a comment, huh?” His lawyer’s details have not been made public yet.","Frank Lucio Carillo, 45, from Winchester, Virginia, was arrested on Friday and appeared in US District Court in Roanoke on Monday to face a federal felony charge that could land him up to five years in prison.

Escalation is not in anyone's interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity.""Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Iran has blamed Israel and said it will ""punish"" it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the situation in the Middle East, including threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and U.S. servicemembers, the White House said. They were also briefed about an attack on Iraq's al Asad airbase on Monday and discussed the U.S. response.During that briefing, Biden and Harris were told by their national security team that it is still unclear when Iran and Hezbollah are likely to launch an attack against Israel ""and the specifics of such an attack,"" according to a U.S. official.At least five U.S. personnel were wounded in the rocket strike, U.S. officials told Reuters. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over Haniyeh's killing, in which the U.S. said it had no involvement.Biden and Harris were also updated on U.S. efforts to support Israel militarily if it is attacked and diplomatic efforts to ""de-escalate regional tension"" and reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza.Blinken earlier on Monday spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.""One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another attack on Israel,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.Miller, speaking at a press briefing, did not say definitively whether or not Washington's messages have been disseminated to Iran or through which channel.""I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and impress that point upon the government of Iran,"" he added.Blinken in his remarks also called for parties to ""break this cycle"" of violence and agree a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, despite the killing of Haniyeh, who was a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.""What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no,"" Blinken said.

US response and ongoing negotiations

Several American troops were injured late Monday when a rocket attack targeted the Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq ’s western desert, according to US defense officials. The base, which has frequently been the target of attacks by Iran-backed Iraqi armed groups, was hit by at least two rockets that landed within its perimeter.The attack comes amid heightened tensions in the region following Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the recent killing of key leaders tied to Hamas and Hezbollah.This latest assault adds to a series of attacks on US military positions in Iraq and Syria over the past month, including a recent incident at a small US base in eastern Syria.Preliminary reports indicate that at least five individuals were wounded in the attack, including both US troops and contractors. While no group has yet claimed responsibility, the strike bears the hallmarks of previous operations by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, whose goal is to force the withdrawal of US forces from the region.The attack on Ain al-Asad Air Base occurred against a backdrop of escalating regional tensions. Last week, a Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran, and Hezbollah leader Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut. Israel has acknowledged responsibility for the assassination of Shukur but has remained silent on Haniyeh’s death. In response, Iran has vowed retaliation through its proxy forces, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and various militant groups in Iraq.While it remains unclear whether this latest rocket attack was part of a broader Iranian response or a continuation of ongoing militia efforts, it underscores the volatile situation in the region. The US military has been on high alert, anticipating potential reprisals similar to the April attack by Iran on Israel following the killing of senior Iranian military figures by Israeli forces.The White House confirmed that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been briefed on the incident and are considering potential responses. A statement from the administration emphasized that any retaliatory action would be carried out ""in a manner and place of our choosing.""The attack has also highlighted ongoing negotiations between US and Iraqi officials over the future of American military presence in the country. While some factions within the Iraqi government, particularly those aligned with Iran, are pushing for a swift US withdrawal, others, including many Iraqi defense officials, favor a continued albeit reduced US involvement to maintain stability.Currently, approximately 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq, with an additional 900 in Syria, where the resurgence of the Islamic State group remains a concern.",A rocket attack targeted the Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq’s western desert.

Whatever that is, we’ll go with,” She said.Pelosi said: “My whole point was, whatever he decides, but we have to have a more aggressive campaign.”In response to claims that Biden is “furious” with her, Pelosi expressed her affection for him, stating, “Well, he knows that I love him very much.”The House Speaker said that her primary goal was to safeguard Biden's achievements. During the CBS interview, Pelosi highlighted the President's successes and commended his performance at the Nato summit, adding, “So he was in a good place to make whatever decision — the top of his game.”“Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States,” she said, later adding, “Well, you got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he’s wonderful. I don’t say take him down. But you can add Biden,” she added.During an interview with ABC News, George Stephanopoulos requested that Pelosi provide more details about her involvement in Biden's choice to withdraw from the race. Pelosi said: “Well, I have the greatest respect for the president. I think he will be … viewed as one of the most consequential presidents in our country.”“It was always about him. And why I said I didn’t make calls — because people said I was burning up the airways. No, I wasn’t. The only person that I spoke to about this was the president. Other people called me about what their views were about it and, but, I rarely even returned a call, much less initiated one,” she added.According to the New York Times, Pelosi said in a recent interview before the release this week of a book on her years in Congress that: ""My goal is to defeat Donald Trump ."" And when you make a decision to defeat somebody, you make every decision in favor of that. You don't mess around with it, OK? What is in furtherance of reaching that goal? I thought we had to have a better campaign.""Nancy Pelosi, in her book ""The Art of Power,"" recounts pivotal instances where she had to make crucial decisions during significant events including the Iraq War, a devastating financial crisis, the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, and various confrontations with Donald Trump during his presidency.According to the former speaker, the urgency to terminate Trump's political career outweighed any need to show deference to Biden, especially considering the high risk Democrats faced of losing control of both the House and Senate if the president remained on the ticket. She appeared to be willing to accept the repercussions of angering Biden and his closest advisors, given the gravity of the situation.Pelosi downplays her influence in Biden's decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race, maintaining that the choice was entirely his own. She stressed that her primary motivation, evident in her attention to polls, fundraising efforts, and private discussions with the president and concerned Democratic colleagues, was the singular goal of defeating Trump.Pelosi asserts that she did not call fellow Democrats, seeking to counter allegations that she had engineered Biden's departure, despite their long-standing alliance.However, if the Democrats emerge victorious this autumn after confronting the possibility of a devastating loss, Pelosi's strategic moves, coupled with the personal entreaties made to Biden by Democratic congressional leaders ""Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York,"" may prove to be among her most consequential actions, the New York Times reported.Pelosi's name has been synonymous with authority and influence in the nation's capital for over two decades. In her book, she aims to chronicle the journey that led her to become one of the most powerful figures in American politics.Pelosi ascended to prominence during an era when the halls of Congress were presumed to be the domain of men, and women were relegated to positions below the ""marble ceiling."" This term, which she employs in her writing, alludes to the ubiquitous building material found throughout Capitol Hill - a substance far more challenging to shatter than glass.""The men explained to me that the House had a pecking order, that other male representatives had been dutifully waiting in line for an upper-level leadership post to open, that I was cutting in and overturning the established order of things,"" Pelosi wrote.","Pelosi downplays her influence in Biden's decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race, maintaining that the choice was entirely his own.

Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday after holding interviews with top contenders at her Washington residence over the weekend, according to two sources familiar with the situation.The announcement could come at any moment, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice-presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, where they will kick off a cross-country tour across several key battleground states that are likely to determine the outcome of the election, the sources indicated.Harris wrapped up her search on Sunday by interviewing three leading candidates—Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro—at her official residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, according to the sources.Harris' search for a running mate began in earnest just two weeks ago, following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the race and endorse her as his successor.Choosing a running mate is one of the most significant decisions of Harris' political career as she quickly assembles a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election.Her shortlist comprises all white male candidates with proven success in winning over rural, white, or independent voters.Over the weekend, Harris consulted with her vetting team, which included former attorney general Eric Holder. Holder's law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, conducted thorough reviews of the finances and backgrounds of the potential running mates. He and his team provided detailed presentations on each finalist, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.Harris is carefully weighing her decision with input from her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West, and a small group of close aides and advisers, the sources said. The candidates are expected to be notified of the decision on Monday night or Tuesday morning, the sources added. The current frontrunners are Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro .Here are their pros and cons:Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is widely considered a leading candidate for Kamala Harris's vice-presidential pick. Speculation around Shapiro intensified after Harris's campaign announced plans to reveal her VP choice at a rally in Philadelphia next week—Shapiro’s home state—which will kick off a series of events in key battleground states. On the positive side, he enjoys significant popularity in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state for Democrats. With Trump currently leading in the polls in Pennsylvania, securing the state’s 19 electoral votes is seen as vital for a Democratic victory in November. Shapiro, considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, is known for his charisma and strong public speaking skills. His moderate stance could appeal to traditional Democrats and independent voters.Some Republicans have privately expressed that Shapiro is the most formidable candidate they could face, according to anonymous sources cited by NBC. Shapiro won the governorship in a landslide in 2022 against Trump-backed state Senator Doug Mastriano and gained national attention for his leadership during a major bridge collapse the following year. His response to an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania was praised by both Republicans and Democrats.However, Shapiro’s candidacy may face challenges, particularly regarding his stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Recently, Shapiro's old article claiming Palestianians couldn't ""co-exist peacefully"" surfaced. Following the October 7 Hamas attacks, Shapiro affirmed his support for Israel’s right to defend itself and resisted calls for a cease-fire. While this aligns him with many Democrats, his vocal criticism of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, which he described as antisemitic and compared to the KKK, could be a vulnerability with the party's left wing and younger voters, whom Harris is keen to attract.Tim Walz brings several strengths to the table as a potential vice presidential candidate. As a proven vote-getter and popular governor in Minnesota, a state that could be pivotal in the upcoming presidential election, Walz’s presence on the ticket might sway the race in favour of the Democrats. His modest background and relatable persona could help him appeal to voters across other crucial swing states, similar to how JD Vance is campaigning for the GOP in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio. Walz's loyalty to the Democratic Party and alignment with Kamala Harris's agenda means he would likely be a reliable and effective voice for the ticket, avoiding internal conflicts and helping to amplify its message. Additionally, as Minnesota’s governor, he has access to experienced local operatives and a record of electoral success that could be leveraged to boost the campaign’s appeal in other swing states.However, Walz faces significant challenges that could hinder his candidacy. His low national profile is a drawback in a high-stakes, fast-paced presidential campaign, where name recognition is crucial. This lack of visibility could also make him an easier target for negative campaigning, particularly by the Trump campaign. Moreover, the key swing states in this election are Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where other potential vice presidential picks like Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly might offer stronger electoral advantages. Walz's handling of the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis could also be used against him, as the GOP might exploit these events to introduce him negatively to a national audience. Lastly, while Walz is a competent and well-liked governor, he lacks the charisma that might add energy to the ticket, potentially leaving the Democratic campaign without the additional “sizzle” that some might argue is needed. Despite these hurdles, this moment offers Walz a chance to step onto the national stage, and his consistent success in Minnesota suggests he should not be counted out in this competition.Mark Kelly brings a unique and impressive background to the table as a potential Vice Presidential candidate. His experience as a US Navy pilot, astronaut, and successful politician in Arizona, a crucial swing state, sets him apart from typical candidates. He also has a twin, which one social media user joked, would allow for twice the number of campaign appearences. Kelly’s centrist approach and strong fundraising abilities have helped him maintain high favourability ratings, making him a valuable asset to Kamala Harris in key battleground states. His personal story, including his partnership with his wife Gabrielle Giffords and their joint advocacy for gun control, resonates with voters on a deep emotional level. Additionally, Kelly’s proximity to the US-Mexico border and his stance on immigration could strengthen the ticket’s appeal, particularly in areas where Harris may face criticism.However, selecting Mark Kelly as Vice President comes with significant risks. The most pressing concern is the potential loss of his Senate seat in Arizona, which could tip the balance of power in the Senate if a Republican were to win the subsequent special election. Additionally, Kelly’s limited experience with political controversy and his less aggressive campaign style might be disadvantages in the high-pressure role of Vice President. His business ties, including his involvement with a space balloon company connected to China and selling vitamins in China, could also be points of attack from opponents. Moreover, while his advocacy for gun control is a strength, it could polarize voters, especially in swing states with strong pro-gun constituencies.","Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy.

Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.
