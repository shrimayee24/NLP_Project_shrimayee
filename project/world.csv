Hindu Sena Chief Vishnu Gupta Allegedly Shot at Near Ajmer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/hindu-sena-petitioner-in-ajmer-dargah-case-shot-at/articleshow/117562555.cms,"AJMER/JAIPUR: Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta alleged Saturday that two unidentified assailants fired at his car around 6 am while he was traveling from Ajmer to his home in New Delhi. Gupta had been in Ajmer to attend a court hearing Friday regarding his lawsuit claiming that a Shiva temple once existed beneath the dargah of 13th-century Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in the city.The alleged attack occurred near Gagwana Ladpura Bridge on the outskirts of Ajmer. ""The moment I heard the gunshots, I told my driver to accelerate immediately. When I glanced back, I saw two men on a motorcycle riding away in the opposite direction,"" Gupta said. He lodged a police complaint and claimed the attack was an attempt to intimidate him and obstruct his legal battle over the Ajmer dargah.Ajmer SP Vandita Rana said that a mark on Gupta's car appeared to be from a pistol shot, but added that the investigation is still underway.“A forensic team was called to examine the crime scene. No arrests have been made, and an investigation is underway,” she said. CCTV footage from the area is being reviewed, but no major leads have been found .This is not the first time Gupta has reported threats to his life. In Nov last year, he filed a complaint in Ajmer, alleging that he had received death threats from an anonymous caller demanding he withdraw his petition. On Jan 23, Gupta demanded police protection, saying his life was in danger due to his lawsuit.Born in 1984 in UP’s Etah, Gupta moved to New Delhi as a child. He claims his political journey began at the age of seven when he participated in the 1991 Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He later joined Shiv Sena’s Delhi youth wing as vice president but resigned due to the party’s stand against north Indians in Mumbai.Gupta’s activities have included provocative demonstrations and inflammatory speeches in Delhi, UP, Haryana, and MP. He first came into the spotlight in 2011 when he assaulted Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan during a press conference.In 2017, he and his supporters attempted to attack CPM leader Sitaram Yechury. His name also surfaced in connection with the 2021 attack on AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s home.Gupta was detained in 2015 over the Kerala House controversy, where his claims about beef being served at the govt guesthouse in New Delhi were later debunked. He also made headlines for his public support of Donald Trump.Gupta’s petition was admitted by an Ajmer civil court on Nov 27 last year.

He also informed the court that Suresh was currently preoccupied with his son's wedding.Additional solicitor general Aravind Kamath, representing ED, said Parvathi being an accused in the case, the agency was empowered to summon her under Section 50(2) of the PMLA to gather evidence.

What is the diplomatic dispute between US and Colombia?

Amidst an ongoing diplomatic tussle between US and Colombia over deported migrants, US President Donald Trump dropped a photo of himself wearing a fedora hat on Truth Social, alongside a sign that read FAFO.The photo and the term FAFO soon went viral with Elon Musk reacting, ""This is awesome."" But what does the acronym mean?FAFO is an acronym that stands for 'F**k around, find out.' The phrase, often used as a warning that one's actions will have consequences, quickly went viral and seemed to emphasise Trump's unwavering stance on the issue.FAFO is not a slur or a derogatory phrase and has been used by people from all political parties, backgrounds, and situations. It is more commonly used in written social media posts, such as captions or on-screen text, but saying 'fa-foh' has also been used, especially in more recent TikToks.The phrase is similar to other expressions like ""If you mess with the bull, you get the horns"" or ""Stir a hornet's nest and get stung,"" conveying the idea that if you create issues or trouble, you will face the inevitable negative consequences.'FAFO' is also a popular song by American singer Bryan Martin (feat.

In one week, the 25% tariffs will be raised to 50%,"" Trump had said. He also announced visa bans for Colombian government officials, enhanced customs inspections of Colombian nationals and cargo, and financial sanctions through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Colombia swiftly responded with its own retaliatory tariffs, imposing a 50% tariff on all US imports. President Gustavo Petro expressed his discontent on social media, saying,""I am informed that you impose a 50% tariff on the fruits of our human labour to enter the United States, and I do the same.""","FAFO is an acronym that stands for 'F**k around, find out' It is not a slur or a derogatory phrase and has been used by people from all political parties, backgrounds, and situations.

No official word yet

A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm, fueled by discussions of a possible separation and an alleged connection between Barack Obama and actress Jennifer Aniston . Amid this, Megyn Kelly, the host of The Megyn Kelly Show , addressed the rumours and said ""it would be a political earthquake"" if it were true.Kelly's social media posts on X and Instagram rapidly spread, drawing attention to the potential consequences of such a separation. ""I don't know whether it is true,"" she said, adding, ""but if it is, it truly would be a political earthquake in Democratic circles, never mind America.""In her video, Kelly further emphasised the rarity of presidential divorces, saying ''I don't remember a presidential divorce in modern history.''A post on X has added fuel to the fire, claiming that Jennifer Aniston is romantically involved with Barack Obama. The post alleged that a friend of Aniston revealed the relationship during a casual conversation at a gathering.""He's with Jennifer Aniston. My old manager, now a friend, is connected to her inner circle. At a gathering with Jennifer's friends, the affair came up casually -- Jennifer herself admitted it. They were sitting with a psychic, which makes it sound surreal, but it's definitely not a secret among her closest friends,"" the message read.The message has since gone viral, sparking heated debates and widespread speculation. Social media users were quick to point out that the rumours align with earlier tabloid claims, despite Aniston's public denial during an October appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Laughing off a magazine cover story suggesting a romance with Barack Obama, Aniston called the claims ""absolutely untrue"" but joked that she wasn't offended by them.Speculation about a possible split intensified when Michelle Obama was conspicuously absent from major events, such as the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.Her team later explained that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii during the funeral. Despite this clarification, reports claiming she has distanced herself from Washington and spends limited time with Barack have fueled the rumours further.As the rumours continue to swirl, neither Barack nor Michelle Obama has commented publicly on the matter. Similarly, Jennifer Aniston has not addressed the latest claims.","A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm.

The United States has frozen all the foreign aids for several countries, including Ukraine on Friday but Israel and Turkey are exempted.An internal directive from secretary of state Marco Rubio, issued shortly after President Donald Trump 's inauguration, emphasised an ""America First"" approach to overseas assistance, AFP reported.""No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved,"" stated the internal memo obtained by AFP.According to the memo, the exceptions were only meant for emergency food, and military funding for Israel and Egypt.This comprehensive directive impacts various aid categories, including development and military support, notably affecting Ukraine, which had received substantial weapons funding under the previous Biden administration during its defence against Russian forces.The suspension also halts US funding for PEPFAR, the HIV/AIDS programme providing anti-retroviral treatments in developing nations, particularly across Africa.PEPFAR, established during George W Bush's presidency in 2003, has preserved approximately 26 million lives and previously maintained broad bipartisan backing in Washington.The directive specifically excludes military aid to Israel, whose US arms support has increased since the Gaza conflict, and Egypt, a recipient of substantial US defence funding since its 1979 peace agreement with Israel.Rubio included provisions for US emergency food aid contributions, which have supported crisis-affected regions including Sudan and Syria.Democratic lawmakers emphasised that PEPFAR provides support to more than 20 million individuals in need of medication, while US-funded anti-malaria programs help 63 million people.","The United States has frozen all the foreign aids for several countries, including Ukraine on Friday.

'Brand name'

Mohammed Sinwar , the younger brother of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar , has emerged as a prominent figure in the group's leadership, becoming a key strategist for Hamas during one of its most challenging periods, reports the New York Post.Israel's military campaign over the past 15 months has resulted in the deaths of over 17,000 Hamas members, while Mohammed Sinwar has played a key role in rebuilding the group and reinforcing its control over Gaza, particularly following the death of his brother Yahya last October.Nicknamed “the shadow” by Israeli officials, Mohammed Sinwar was born in 1975 in a Khan Younis refugee camp and has risen to prominence within Hamas' leadership. Following the death of his brother Yahya Sinwar in October last year, Hamas established a governing council to make it harder for Israel to target its leaders. Mohammed has become the council's key leader, working to rebuild and strengthen the group after its losses.Mohammed’s influence was witnessed during the recent hostage exchange in Gaza City. Hamas fighters in uniforms paraded four Israeli hostages through Palestine Square as supporters cheered and threw confetti. Critics argued that the exchange showed Israel's inability to fully dismantle Hamas despite over a year of continuous conflict, with Sinwar credited for the group's revival.Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli brigadier general, told the Wall Street Journal: “We are in a situation where the pace at which Hamas is rebuilding itself is higher than the pace that the IDF is eradicating them. Mohammed Sinwar is managing everything.”The US has raised similar concerns, claiming that Hamas has replaced fighters lost during Israel’s operations by taking advantage of Gaza’s humanitarian crisis. Reports say Mohammed had directed his men to promise food and medicine to recruit thousands, even attending funerals to win over grieving families.Mohammed's radical views were shaped early on by his brother Yahya and Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Growing up, he was surrounded by militants plotting attacks on Israel. At 13, he witnessed his brother's arrest, an event that reportedly strengthened his loyalty to Hamas.In 1991, Mohammed was imprisoned by the IDF for nine months on suspicion of terrorist activity, reports the Jerusalem Post. He spent a total of three years in custody throughout the 1990s, including some time in Palestinian security forces’ detention under pressure from Israel.Mohammed Sinwar became well-known within Hamas after leading the 2006 raid that captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. The operation eventually led to Yahya’s release in a 2011 prisoner swap.Over the years, Mohammed had remained a trusted ally to his brother, playing a significant role in planning the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, which killed over 1,200 people and left 251 others taken hostage.Mohammed Sinwar’s leadership remains largely secretive, but his rise within Hamas has made him a key figure.Counter-terrorism expert Colin Clarke notes that Sinwar’s connection to his brother Yahya has boosted his reputation in Gaza. Clarke describes him as a “brand name,” with Hamas using his status to strengthen its influence.“He’s definitely riding on his name,” Clarke told The Post. “He’s a brand name that carries a lot of clout in Gaza because of his brother, so Hamas will be sure to use that,"" he added.The conflict has heavily impacted Gaza, with the health ministry reporting over 47,000 Palestinian deaths since the October attacks. A recent ceasefire and prisoner-hostage exchange aims to pave the way for peace and possible negotiations.",Mohammed Sinwar is the younger brother of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar. He has played a key role in rebuilding the group and reinforcing its control over Gaza. He was born in 1975 in a Khan Younis refugee camp and has risen to prominence.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117607032,imgsize-380142,width-400,resizemode-4/117607032.jpg"
January 6 Capitol Riot: US: Indiana man pardoned by Trump for Jan 6 role fatally shot by police,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-indiana-man-pardoned-by-trump-for-jan-6-role-fatally-shot-by-police/articleshow/117616704.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Matthew J Huttle , a 42-year-old Indiana man recently pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Jasper County, Indiana, on Sunday evening.The shooting occurred after an altercation with a sheriff’s deputy who attempted to arrest him, according to the Indiana State Police.The deputy stopped Huttle on State Road 14 around 4:15 pm (local time) and attempted to arrest him for undisclosed reasons. During the interaction, police say Huttle resisted arrest, leading to a scuffle.Authorities confirmed Huttle was armed, but specific details about the altercation and the circumstances surrounding the firearm’s involvement remain unclear. As per the Washington Post, Huttle had been arrested multiple times since his initial charges in connection with the Capitol riot.The deputy involved in the shooting has been placed on paid administrative leave, following standard protocol. Jasper County Sheriff Patrick Williamson extended condolences to Huttle’s family, stating, “Any loss of life is traumatic to those close to Mr. Huttle.”Huttle pleaded guilty in 2023 to a misdemeanour charge of entering restricted grounds during the Capitol riot. Prosecutors described him as “at the forefront of violence” during the event, helping to breach police lines and roam the Capitol searching for members of Congress. Huttle served six months in jail—double the average sentence for similar charges—and was released in July 2024, according to The Guardian.President Trump pardoned Huttle and nearly 1,600 others involved in the January 6 riot on his first day back in office, citing a campaign promise to provide clemency to those he referred to as political prisoners.Huttle travelled to Washington, DC, with his uncle, Dale Huttle, who was also charged with participating in the riot. While Matthew recorded videos inside the Capitol, his uncle assaulted law enforcement with a flagpole, earning a 30-month prison sentence. Dale was released last week under the same round of pardons.In interviews with FBI agents, Matthew Huttle expressed no remorse for his actions, claiming he was there to document potential government corruption. He also alleged the FBI was responsible for instigating the riot, suggesting some attackers displayed “too much training to be civilians,” as per the New York Post.Huttle’s shooting comes amid heightened scrutiny of Trump’s pardons for January 6 participants. Experts and law enforcement have warned that such pardons might embolden further acts of political violence . Another pardoned rioter, Daniel Ball of Florida, was recently rearrested on federal gun charges stemming from his actions before and during the Capitol attack, according to The Guardian.","Matthew J Huttle, 42, was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Jasper County, Indiana, on Sunday evening.

Google Maps will soon display new naming conventions for two prominent US landmarks following President Donald Trump's executive orders.The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the “Gulf of America,” and Alaska’s Denali will revert to its former name, Mount McKinley , according to updates from Google.The Trump administration officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico last week, directing federal agencies to adopt the term “Gulf of America” on all official documents and platforms. Google Maps confirmed the changes would take effect once the US Geographic Names Information System reflects the updates.“We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,” Google noted on social media platform X.However, the Gulf will still be labelled ""Gulf of Mexico"" for users in Mexico, while users outside both nations will see both names.Similarly, the Trump administration reinstated the name Mount McKinley for North America’s tallest peak, which was renamed Denali during President Barack Obama’s administration in 2015.The change was initially made to honour Alaska Native heritage, as “Denali” means ""the high one"" in the Koyukon Athabaskan language. Trump, however, cited the historical significance of honouring President William McKinley, stating that McKinley contributed to America's prosperity through tariffs and strong leadership.Google Maps will implement this change for also for US users, while international users will see both names, continuing its dual-labeling policy for disputed or dual-use geographic names, as per Reuters.Renaming disputes are not new for Google Maps. For example, bodies of water like the ""Sea of Japan (East Sea)"" and the ""Persian Gulf (Arabian Gulf)"" are labelled with dual names to respect varying international perspectives. This approach ensures users see culturally and politically sensitive names in their local contexts.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum recently joked that North America could be renamed ""Mexican America"" in response to Trump’s order, referencing early historical maps of the region.","The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the ‘Gulf of America’ on Google Maps.

Winter downpours trigger mud flow in fire ravaged regions of Southern California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/winter-downpours-trigger-mud-flow-in-fire-ravaged-regions-of-southern-california/articleshow/117616467.cms,"Winter storm after dry spell

Clean up efforts

Southern California experienced its first major storm of the season on Monday, bringing much-needed rain and snow to the region, which helped douse the wildfires. The downpour also triggered ash and mud flows across streets in Los Angeles, particularly in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood, where emergency crews worked tirelessly to clear debris-covered roads, including the iconic Pacific Coast Highway.The region witnessed more than 2.5 cm of rainfall, which loosened hillsides that had been burned bare by recent wildfires. In nearby Malibu, dangerous road conditions led to the closing of four schools, according to the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District.Though skies cleared, flood watches remained in place for fire-ravaged areas such as the Palisades, Altadena, and Castaic Lake.Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in LA told news agency AP, “All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff.”Snowy conditions wreaked havoc north of Los Angeles, shutting down Tejon Pass on Interstate 5 late Sunday. The pass, a critical transport route, reopened Monday afternoon after icy conditions eased. Mountain ranges in San Bernardino and Riverside counties received a winter storm warning , with forecasts of up to a foot (30cm) of snow, requiring chains for vehicles heading to Big Bear Lake ski resorts.The storm marked the end of months of dry, gusty weather that heightened fire risks. Los Angeles County crews spent the past week preparing fire-stricken areas by clearing vegetation, stabilising slopes, and reinforcing roads.The recent Palisades fire, which claimed 12 lives and destroyed thousands of homes, was 94 per cent contained by Monday, while the Eaton fire, responsible for 17 fatalities near Altadena, reached 98 per cent containment. Similar progress was also reported on the Hughes fire and the Border 2 Fire near the US-Mexico border.LA city and county officials ramped up clean up measures to tackle the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. A White House statement on Friday also revealed that US President Donald Trump had directed federal officials to assist local authorities.In a statement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other departments assured that they, “shall develop and execute a plan to expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris.”The officials further cautioned that the ash left after the recent blaze was a toxic combination of cars, electronics, building materials, batteries, paints, furniture and other household items, which contained pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Hence the residents were advised to carry protective gear while cleaning up.The rainfall had increased the vulnerability of Southern California’s fire-scarred regions, much like Montecito's tragic 2018 mudslides, which claimed 23 lives following similar post-fire rainstorms.Most of Southern California remains in a state of “extreme” or “severe” drought, according to the US Drought Monitor, however this storm has offered a brief relief from the region's dry spell.","Southern California experienced its first major storm of the season on Monday.

Dozens of senior aid officials placed on leave amid investigation into alleged effort to thwart Donald Trump's orders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dozens-of-senior-aid-officials-placed-on-leave-amid-investigation-into-alleged-effort-to-thwart-donald-trumps-orders/articleshow/117616419.cms,"Fallout from Trump's executive orders

Focus on US interests

At least 56 senior officials from the US agency for international development (USAID) were placed on administrative leave Monday following an internal investigation into an alleged attempt to undermine US President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders. The move, confirmed by both current and former USAID officials, has raised questions about the agency's compliance with the President’s directives.According to a report from news agency AP, the USAID employees, many of whom have served under multiple administrations, were placed on leave after Jason Gray, the acting administrator, identified actions within the agency that appeared to circumvent Trump's executive orders. The freeze on most US foreign assistance, which was issued last week, has had a sweeping impact on aid organisations across the globe, with thousands of employees now facing layoffs as programs grind to a halt.""We have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions,"" Gray wrote in an internal USAID notice obtained by The Associated Press. The notice did not specify which executive orders the employees were suspected of violating.The decision to place the senior USAID officials on leave follows an executive order by President Trump, which directed a 90-day pause on most foreign assistance disbursed through the state department. As a result of the freeze, critical humanitarian, development, and security programs around the world have stopped or are preparing to cease operations.The USAID staff were working to address the impact of the freeze, attempting to secure waivers to continue providing life-saving services, including access to clean water in Sudan and monitoring global health threats like bird flu. However, many of these efforts have been halted, leaving aid organizations scrambling to find alternate funding sources.In addition to the freeze on foreign assistance, secretary of state Marco Rubio has exempted only emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt from the suspension. Trump and GOP lawmakers have voiced concerns about the effectiveness and necessity of foreign aid, with many calling for a thorough review of each program to determine whether it aligns with US interests and is worth funding.While the freeze has caused significant disruption in international aid efforts, the Trump administration and its allies argue that the pause will allow the US government to assess foreign assistance programs more critically and eliminate those that are perceived as wasteful or politically driven.The decision to place USAID officials on leave has sparked significant attention, with many questioning how this investigation might reshape US foreign aid priorities in the years to come.As of now, no timeline has been set for the completion of the investigation, and USAID has not yet indicated which individuals will ultimately return to their roles.","At least 56 senior officials from the US agency for international development (USAID) were placed on administrative leave Monday.

The Standoff: Trump’s Tariffs vs. Petro’s Pride



Golf Diplomacy at Its Peak



A Million TV Shows, But Nothing Like This



Lessons from the Green



In a world where political dramas like House of Cards thrive on intrigue and audacity, even the most incredulous storylines pale in comparison to the spectacle of Donald Trump's presidency. Hollywood scriptwriters might be dismissed outright for proposing a scenario where a sitting president resolves international conflicts mid-golf game while simultaneously live-tweeting. Yet, that’s precisely what Trump accomplished, making even Frank Underwood look timid.The recent face-off between President Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro encapsulates this unparalleled approach. What began as a defiant standoff by Petro ended halfway through one of Trump’s golf rounds, proving once again that Trump’s playbook—equal parts spectacle and strategy—continues to rewrite the rules of global diplomacy.It started with a bold move: Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s leftist president, refused to allow US military planes carrying deported Colombian migrants to land in his country. Petro framed his stance as a stand for dignity and sovereignty, invoking historical grievances and the resilience of his people in fiery social media posts. However, Trump, never one to shy away from confrontation, retaliated swiftly with a 25% tariff on Colombian goods, a threat to double it within a week, and visa sanctions targeting Colombian officials.Petro’s response was defiant, even poetic, as he drew on Colombia’s rich history and cultural identity . In a lengthy statement, he challenged Trump’s arrogance, criticized US interventionism, and vowed that Colombia would “stop looking northward” and instead “open itself to the world.”Yet, as dramatic as the rhetoric was, the economic reality began to bite. Trump, from the golf course, turned up the heat. By the time Petro’s defiance reached its crescendo, Trump had not only set the terms but also made it clear that the clock was ticking. The mounting economic pressure, coupled with Trump’s characteristic brazenness, left Petro with little choice.Petro’s resistance crumbled before Trump even finished half a game. It’s reported that Trump, between putts, dictated a series of tweets and press releases that not only outlined the consequences for Colombia but also turned the situation into a media spectacle. The pièce de résistance was Trump’s viral FAFO post—an a cronym for “F*** around, find out” —cementing his stance and adding a touch of meme-worthy bravado to the diplomatic row.In a few hourse, Petro announced a reversal of his position. The presidential plane of Colombia would be used to facilitate the “dignified return” of deported migrants. The tariffs and sanctions Trump had threatened were “held in reserve,” pending compliance with US demands.What sets this episode apart is not just Trump’s unapologetic style but the sheer efficiency with which he achieves results. While traditional diplomacy involves layers of negotiation, Trump’s approach resembles a high-stakes poker game played in full view of the public. The combination of economic leverage, social media theatrics, and an unwavering confidence in his own methods has redefined presidential diplomacy in ways that no political drama or Hollywood script could anticipate.For better or worse, Trump’s handling of the Petro standoff will be studied as a case study in power dynamics and modern leadership. It demonstrates the efficacy of combining economic might with media savvy, though it also underscores the vulnerability of nations dependent on US trade. As Trump sinks his putts and Petro reflects on the economic realities of his decisions, one thing becomes clear: in Trump’s world, the art of the deal isn’t confined to boardrooms or summits—it’s as likely to unfold on the back nine of a golf course. However, it should be mentioned that Trump has more challenging assignments on the cards. Bullying Colombia is chickenfeed compared to dealing with China or ending the Russia-Ukraine war. That wil be a true test of Trump's mettle.","President Donald Trump faced off against Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

President Donald Trump on Monday announced a series of sweeping executive orders, signing a few already, that includes, reinstatement of service members discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccinations and the elimination of DEI initiatives across federal agencies and the military. Additional orders are expected as well-known television personality Pete Hegseth begins his first day as the new Pentagon chief.Earlier, speaking at a Republican gathering, Trump pledged to reinstate service members discharged over Covid-19 vaccine refusals and dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEO) programs within the military.“We will build an Iron Dome for America — a system to protect our homeland from missile and drone threats,” Trump said. “This is a top priority for ensuring our national defence.”Defence secretary Pete Hegseth, on his first day in office, confirmed the plans, describing the initiative as a critical step in modernising United States missile defence capabilities.Trump’s has signed the reinstatement of service members discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccinations. He assured they would return to their former ranks with full back pay. “We will offer full reinstatement to any service member who was expelled from the armed forces due to the Covid vaccine mandate,” he said.While the Pentagon formally ended the vaccine mandate in January 2023, the order could have financial implications if large numbers of discharged troops re-enlist. To date, fewer than 150 of the 8,200 discharged service members have sought to return, citing new careers or reluctance to re-join.Returning personnel would still need to meet military entry standards, including physical fitness, medical requirements, and background checks. Officers would also need to undergo a recommissioning process.Trump also directed the Pentagon to reassess policies on transgender troops, emphasising military readiness. The order does not immediately ban transgender service members but mandates the development of new guidelines.In addition, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise to eliminate DEI initiatives across federal agencies and the military. Hegseth emphasised a focus on readiness, saying, “Military training will prioritise what our troops in the field need to deter our enemies.”The removal of DEI programs has already caused confusion within the armed forces.Last week, videos honouring the historic contributions of the Tuskegee Airmen and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) were temporarily removed during a review of DEI training materials.The air force later clarified that these materials would remain part of its curriculum, highlighting their decorated service in World War II.Hegseth outlined additional priorities, including using active duty, national guard, and state-activated guard troops to address border security.He also reaffirmed Trump’s commitment to the Iron Dome project, which aims to provide the US with a domestic missile defense system akin to Israel’s.“We are moving quickly to ensure the safety and security of the American people,” Hegseth said, as he entered the Pentagon on Monday morning.Hegseth, confirmed in a tie-breaking Senate vote by vice president JD Vance, is expected to oversee the rapid rollout of these initiatives in the coming weeks.","Pete Hegseth begins his first day as the new Pentagon chief.

US Missile Defense System: ‘To protect Americans’: Trump to order development of US’ own ‘Iron Dome’ defence system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-protect-americans-trump-to-order-development-of-us-own-iron-dome-defence-system/articleshow/117615594.cms,"Trump to order development of US’ own ‘Iron Dome’ defence system(Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced plans to construct a domestic version of Israel’s renowned ""Iron Dome"" missile defence system, as per remarks made at a Republican congressional retreat in Miami on Monday.The executive order will aim to build a state-of-the-art air defence shield designed to protect the United States from missile threats.“We need to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defence shield, which will be able to protect Americans,” Trump stated. He highlighted that the system, like Israel’s, will be produced domestically, saying, “It will be made right here in the USA.”The Israeli Iron Dome has gained worldwide acclaim for intercepting short-range rocket attacks, particularly during recent conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah. Trump praised the system, saying it “knocks down just about every one of them” and emphasised the United States' entitlement to similar protection.While Trump’s announcement drew from Israel's success, experts have noted that the Iron Dome is specifically designed for short-range rocket threats and may not address the US' primary missile concerns, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).According to a CNN fact sheet, the executive order mandates a more advanced, layered missile defence shield capable of addressing threats from ballistic, hypersonic and advanced cruise missiles.The project envisions space-based systems to detect and neutralise attacks, though no detailed timeline or cost estimates were provided. Existing US defences, such as Patriot missile systems and shoulder-launched Stinger missiles, already offer a multi-layered response to some missile threats, but the proposed system would represent a significant technological leap.In addition to the Iron Dome initiative, Trump is likely to sign three other executive orders focused on military policies, including reinstating service members discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccination, banning transgender individuals from military service, and ending Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs in the armed forces, reported CNN.","US President Donald Trump announced plans to construct a domestic version of Israel’s renowned ""Iron Dome"" missile defence system.

Donald Trump says will sign order to get 'transgender ideology the hell out of military',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-says-will-sign-order-to-get-transgender-ideology-the-hell-out-of-military/articleshow/117615416.cms,"Dramatic policy shifts over past decade

US military

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced his intention to sign an executive order eliminating what he described as ""transgender ideology"" from the military, a move that could represent a significant rollback of LGBTQ rights in the armed forces.Speaking at a Republican congressional retreat in Miami, Trump declared the policy as one of ""four new executive orders"" he plans to enact related to the military.""To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military,"" Trump said, reiterating his long-standing opposition to allowing transgender individuals to serve.This announcement reignites a contentious debate over the inclusion of transgender Americans in the armed forces, an issue that has seen dramatic policy shifts over the past decade. The ban on transgender service members was first lifted in 2016 during the then President Barack Obama's administration, allowing them to serve openly and paving the way for transgender recruits to join starting in 2017.However, Trump's first administration delayed the implementation of that policy before ultimately reversing it entirely, citing concerns about costs, disruptions, and military readiness. Critics of the reversal, including LGBTQ rights groups , argued that it was discriminatory and undermined the principle of equality in military service.In contrast, Joe Biden restored the Obama-era policy just days after taking office in 2021, asserting that all qualified Americans who wished to serve should be able to do so. This policy change allowed transgender troops to serve openly and provided protection against discrimination.Trump's renewed push to ban transgender individuals from the military aligns with broader efforts by some Republicans to restrict transgender rights across the country. States controlled by Republican lawmakers have enacted legislation limiting access to gender-affirming care, barring transgender athletes from competing in school sports, and regulating what books on the topic can appear in public and school libraries.The number of transgender service members in the US military is relatively small, with estimates suggesting around 15,000 out of more than two million uniformed personnel. Nonetheless, their removal could have a tangible impact on the military's capacity, particularly at a time when recruitment challenges are mounting.Lloyd Austin appeared to take aim at Trump's plans in a recent farewell address, warning of the potential consequences of excluding qualified Americans from military service. ""Any military that turns away qualified patriots who are eager to serve is just making itself smaller and weaker,"" Austin said.","US President Donald Trump announced his intention to sign an executive order eliminating what he described as ""transgender ideology"" from the military.

DOJ shake-up: Donald Trump fires dozens of justice department employees involved in his prosecutions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doj-shake-up-donald-trump-fires-dozens-of-justice-department-employees-involved-in-his-prosecutions/articleshow/117615229.cms,"Trump had vowed before election to fire Smith 'on day one'

In a sweeping move that underscores the US President Donald Trump administration 's efforts to reshape federal law enforcement , acting attorney general James McHenry on Monday fired more than a dozen prosecutors who had worked on the two criminal investigations into Trump for special counsel Jack Smith . According to a justice department spokesperson, the decision was based on concerns that the prosecutors could not be trusted to ""faithfully implement"" the president's agenda.""Acting attorney general James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,"" a justice department official said.While the department declined to name the prosecutors involved, sources familiar with the situation revealed that many of the dismissals targeted career lawyers who were protected under civil service laws. A person who had worked alongside members of Smith's team described the firings as likely violating these protections, raising questions about the legality of the administration's actions.The firings, though abrupt, were not entirely unexpected. Trump had long vowed to remove Smith and his team, citing personal grievances over their investigations into his actions. While Smith and several of his top prosecutors resigned before Trump's inauguration, others had returned to their original posts, including roles within the US attorney's office in Washington.The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten control over the justice department and centralise decision-making within the White House. Last week, Trump's team initiated a series of personnel changes that saw the reassignment of Bradley Weinsheimer, the associate deputy attorney general and one of the department's most senior career officials, to a less influential position.Weinsheimer, a respected figure in the justice department with extensive experience in managing sensitive cases, is just one of several seasoned officials affected by the administration’s overhaul. Key supervisors with expertise in national security, international investigations, extraditions, and public corruption have also been reassigned, with some choosing to resign in protest. On Monday, the chief of the public integrity section announced his resignation, further signalling discontent within the department.The firings come as Trump doubles down on his promise to dismantle and reconstruct the justice department, a pledge he has repeatedly made in public statements. Legal experts warn that the administration's actions could undermine the department's independence and erode public confidence in the impartiality of federal law enforcement.It remains unclear who will replace the ousted prosecutors and officials, but the move has already sparked intense scrutiny and debate over the future of the justice department under Trump’s leadership.",The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten control over the justice department.

Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said the administration owes no apology to celebrities like Selena Gomez who are not in favor of mass deportation. As Homan appeared on Fox News, he was asked about the celebrity reaction and also the allegation that not only illegal migrants but ""everyday people"" are being attacked, Homan said if they don't like it, then they should go to Congress and change the law.“We're going to do this operation without apology. We're gonna make our community safer. It is all for the good of this nation. And we're gonna keep going. No apologies. We're moving forward,"" Tom Homan said.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said at least 956 people were arrested on a nationwide immigration crackdown Sunday -- the highest since Donald Trump returned to power. ICE raids are going on in a number of cities including Chicago, Newark and Miami. Schools are also being raided spreading fear among students. On Sunday, in an interview with ABC News, Homan said he expected arrest and deportation numbers to ""steadily increase,"" and said the focus right now was ""public safety threats, national security threats"".In the wake of the mass deportation, Selena Gomez took to her Instagram story and broke down as she said, ""All my people are getting attacked, the children. I don’t understand. I’m so sorry. I wish I could do something but I can’t.” Gomez's family is from Mexico. ""I'm sorry,"" she wrote with an emoji of the Mexican flag on her video which is now deleted.""Apparently it's not ok to show empathy for people,"" Gomez wrote in a follow-up post but both posts were deleted.Television personality Dr Phil (Phil McGraw) tagged along with the ICE on their deportation drive as Homan also joined the drive Sunday. “It’s a pretty high-risk mission that we’re going on,” Dr. Phil said in one video, claiming that the operation was aimed at capturing over 200 “high-value targets,” or people with criminal histories.","Tom Homan said the administration owes no apology to celebrities like Selena Gomez who are not in favor of mass deportation.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

Upon reaching KN Shah, the protest culminated in a massive public rally where leaders delivered passionate speeches, urging the government to halt land seizures.They called for the prioritisation of local farmers by providing modern agricultural tools and support to improve productivity, reported Dawn.Key speakers at the rally included AT leader Noor Ahmed Katiar , who condemned the planned network of new canals meant to supply water to corporate farming projects. Katiar warned, ""This will lead to a crisis in Sindh,"" and accused former President Asif Zardari of violating the Constitution by approving the construction of six new canals, as highlighted by Dawn.AT general secretary advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar also addressed the crowd, criticising the coalition government for advancing the canal projects.

Chinese nationals file petition against harassment by Pakistani police,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/chinese-nationals-file-petition-against-harassment-by-pakistani-police/articleshow/117561594.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani high court has issued notices to the ministry of foreign affairs and others in response to a petition filed by Chinese citizens seeking relief from harassment, extortion, and unconstitutional restrictions on their movement enforced by police in southern Sindh province.At least 12 Chinese nationals had filed a petition in the Sindh HC in Dec claiming that they, along with thousands of other Chinese citizens, came to Pakistan after completing all necessary legal formalities and invested significant amounts of money and resources in various business ventures and sectors. Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre. They warned that unless the authorities intervened they would either return to Lahore or leave the country altogether.The petitioners requested the HC to direct the authorities to respect the rights of Chinese nationals in conformity with international laws. In response, the court sent notices to all parties concerned, including the home ministry, chief secretary and police chief of Sindh, home secretary, the head of the special unit for CPEC security, and the Chinese embassy.","At least 12 Chinese nationals had filed a petition in the Sindh HC in Dec.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence. And once someone is charged, they can be denied bail and face lengthy and unfair trials,"" it said.",A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook.
