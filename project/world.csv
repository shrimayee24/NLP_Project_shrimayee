NEW DELHI: A musical performance featuring the RSS ""gana geetham"" (prayer song) at a temple in Kottukkal, managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), has ignited row, with the opposition Congress demanding strict action against those involved.The song was performed by a professional music troupe during a gana mela (musical fest) held in the early hours of Sunday as part of temple festivities . According to PTI, the police said there were also allegations that RSS flags had been erected on the temple premises in connection with the event.Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan called the incident “a matter of grave concern,” citing a high court directive that bars political activity on temple grounds.He urged the TDB to act swiftly and firmly, stating, “Temples belong to devotees. Politicising religious spaces reflects a narrow-minded approach.”Kadakkal police confirmed receiving a complaint from a member of the temple’s advisory committee but said no case had yet been registered.The controversy follows a recent incident in the same police jurisdiction where ""revolutionary songs"" praising the CPM were reportedly performed during another temple festival, further fuelling debate over political influence in religious spaces.","A musical performance featuring the RSS ""gana geetham"" (prayer song) at a temple in Kottukkal has ignited row.

MEERUT: UP Power Corporation (UPPC) has dismissed a contractual lineman for allegedly waving the Palestinian flag after offering namaz on Eid in the Gagalheri police station area of UP's Saharanpur district.The action came after Saqib Khan , 35, a resident of Kailashpuri village in Saharanpur, posted a photograph of himself holding the Palestinian flag on social media.Police summoned Khan for questioning on the same day and interrogated him for two hours before releasing him without any charges. However, local right-wing groups warned of public demonstrations if action was not taken. TOI attempted to reach Khan for a response, but he was unavailable.UPPC's Baliakheri sub-divisional officer Shishir Kumar Chahi said, ""Khan was posted at the Kailashpur power substation under the Baliakheri electricity distribution division. As soon as the matter came to our notice, his services were terminated immediately. We examined the conduct of other employees as well, but Khan alone was found involved in this anti-national activity.""Another contractual lineman in Meerut, who requested anonymity, said most contracts outline clear terms - ""employees must follow a code of conduct, avoid any anti-national activity, and stay away from corruption or criminal involvement. If these conditions are breached, employers have the right to terminate the contract without delay"".He added, ""The set of rules remains more or less the same in every contract. However, the terms and conditions may vary depending on the company that holds the tender to manage contractual employees. In case of termination, the lineman can challenge the decision in court.""UPPC executive engineer Sanjeev Kumar wrote to the private company that hired Khan, directing them to terminate his services with immediate effect, based on documents accessed by TOI. In his letter, Kumar said Saqib was found involved in ""anti-national activities"" by waving the Palestinian flag and sharing the image online.Saharanpur (city) SP Vyom Bindal said, ""The matter is under investigation and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings of the probe. Our primary concern was to ensure there was no breach of peace.

State party president K Annamalai called the chief minister’s explanation “unacceptable” and said the absence was deliberate and politically motivated.“The Prime Minister did not go to New Delhi directly from Sri Lanka but came here to dedicate projects.

CNBC host Jim Cramer predicted a 1987-like ' Black Monday ' coming week because of the tariffs Donald Trump imposed on countries. ""If the president doesn't try to reach out and reward these countries and companies that play by the rules, then the 1987 scenario...the one where we went down three days and then down 22% on Monday, has the most cogency. We will not have to wait too long to know. We will know it by Monday,"" Cramer said.“It’s tough to build a new, weaker, world order on the fly.

Those who bottom-fished are sleeping with the fishes …so far,' Cramer posted on XThe market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on Thursday and Friday after Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by more than 2,200 points after China unveiled stiff retaliatory taxes to President Trump’s tariffs.

Pressure and threats are not the correct ways to engage with China,” the foreign ministry said in a lengthy statement today.Trump maintained his stance on tariffs and urged Americans to ""hang tough"" as the tariffs are not going to be easy. China and “many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,” Trump said, accusing them of using the United States as a “whipping post,” reiterating his rationale for the tariffs as he has accused other countries of “taking advantage” of the United States.","The market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on Thursday and Friday after Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday.

US Visa News: Anyone who isn't a US citizen should think twice before traveling outside especially if...: Experts warn amid crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anyone-who-isnt-a-us-citizen-should-think-twice-before-traveling-outside-especially-if-experts-warn-amid-crackdown/articleshow/120023858.cms,"Experts feel green card holders should think twice now before traveling outside the US if they have criticized Trump on social media.

Poll Do you think green card holders should reconsider traveling abroad in light of recent immigration policies? No, I believe it's safe. Yes, it's too risky.

Having correct documents is most important

Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn amid the massive crackdown on international students and migrants. ""Anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen should think hard about the need to leave the United States, especially if they have made statements on social media that are critical of political positions that the Trump administration supports or have had even minimal contact with police,"" César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, the Gregory Williams Chair in civil rights & civil liberties at Ohio State University College of Law, told Newsweek.""The Trump administration has given permanent residents and visa holders plenty of reason to worry about running into problems trying to get back into the United States from a trip abroad,"" the immigration law expert said, though the administration asserted that those who have not broken any laws have nothing to fear about anything.Shannon Shepherd, chair of the media committee for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) told Newsweek that overall there's no guarantee that a person coming back to the US will be granted entry and that's been the case always. ""But what we're seeing lately is more negative exercise of discretion, I guess is the way to put it, where people are being denied entry that we wouldn't necessarily have been denied before or people being detained instead of just allowed to withdraw their request for entry.""According to these experts, having the correct documentation is of utmost importance. For green card holders, the documents are a valid passport and the green card. If the green card is up for renewal, then one must vatty the receipt from the US Citizenship and Immigration Service.Past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of CBP officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages, in order to deny entry even if the traveler has all the correct paperwork, Shepherd said.If an individual is in the process of applying for a green card, known as Adjustment of Status (AoS), then they generally can't leave the country without Advance Parole. This is a travel document that has to be granted by USCIS before travel. CBP website mentions that those with valid H-1B or L-1 visas going through AoS are allowed to travel without Advance Parole, as are V- and K-3/4 nonimmigrant visa holders.","Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn.

NEW DELHI: A mob set fire to the house of BJP Minority Morcha’s Manipur president Asker Ali in Lilong, Thoubal district, late Sunday night, after he publicly voiced support for the Waqf Amendment Act, officials said.Ali had endorsed the Act on social media on Saturday, triggering backlash. Around 9 pm on Sunday, an angry mob gathered outside his home, vandalised the property and then set it on fire, according to officials.Following the attack, Ali posted a video apology, retracting his earlier statement and saying he no longer supports the Act.The incident came amid widespread protests in the Imphal Valley, with demonstrations erupting in multiple Muslim-majority areas.Over 5,000 people took to the streets in Lilong, blocking traffic along NH-102. Tensions flared in Irong Chesaba, where protesters clashed with security forces after being stopped from advancing.Demonstrators raised slogans against the BJP-led government, accusing it of imposing a law that undermines constitutional values.""The Waqf Amendment Act is against the ethos of the Constitution. It is completely unacceptable for the Muslim community,"" said protester Sakir Ahmed.Protests were also reported in Kshatri Awang Leikai, Kairang Muslim, Kiyamgei Muslim (Imphal East) and Sora (Thoubal), among other areas.Security forces have been reinforced in Muslim-dominated areas of the valley, officials confirmed, amid fears of further unrest.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday and Rajya Sabha on Friday, aims to streamline Waqf property management, ensure transparency, and safeguard heritage sites.President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Bill on Saturday, making it law.A day after a mob set fire to the house of BJP Minority Morcha’s Manipur president Md Asker Ali in Lilong, the Thoubal district administration on Monday imposed prohibitory orders under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) in the entire Lilong Assembly constituency.The move comes amid heightened tension over Ali’s alleged support for the Waqf Amendment Act, which triggered widespread protests.The order, issued by the district magistrate, bans the assembly of five or more people and prohibits the public from carrying firearms, swords, sticks, stones, or other lethal weapons.The decision followed a report from the superintendent of police, stating that a mob of around 7,000-8,000 people, armed with lathis and stones, stormed Ali’s residence in Lilong Sambrukhong Mamei area on Sunday night and set it ablaze.Ali had expressed support for the Waqf Amendment Act on social media, but retracted and apologised after the violence.

Trump defends tariffs, takes questions from reporters aboard Air Force One

US President Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from around the world, saying he would not back off unless trade imbalances with the US were addressed.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump acknowledged the economic uncertainty caused by the tariffs but said the move was necessary for long-term stability.When asked, ""Is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate?""""I think your question is so stupid,"" Trump reacted fiercely to the reporter's question.""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something and we have been treated so badly by other countries,"" Trump said, referring to the sharp market downturn triggered by his trade moves.The president's comments came as global markets braced for further volatility, with US stock futures plunging Sunday evening; Dow and S&P 500 futures dropped nearly 4 per cent, while Nasdaq futures fell nearly 5 per cent. Bitcoin also declined about 6 per cent.Despite rising fears of a recession, Trump showed no signs of backing down. ""They're dying to make a deal,"" he said of world leaders, adding, ""We're not going to have deficits with your country. We're going to have surpluses or, at worst, going to be breaking even.""Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said these were not issues that could be resolved overnight and that the US would assess offers carefully.Top economic adviser Kevin Hassett admitted that some countries were retaliating but claimed more than 50 nations had approached the White House to start negotiations.While Trump spent the weekend golfing in Florida, his administration worked to defend the tariffs publicly. ""There doesn't have to be a recession,"" Bessent said. ""What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.""Trump also took to social media to rally support, posting, ""WE WILL WIN.

"After Trump’s tariffs, stocks plunged but penguin memes ticked up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-trumps-tariffs-stocks-plunged-but-penguin-memes-ticked-up/articleshow/120048973.cms,"The Trump administration this week levied sweeping tariffs across the globe, provoking retaliation from other countries and sending the stock market tumbling. An unexpected consequence? Penguin memes .Images of the flightless birds have waddled their way across the internet this week after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands , Australian territories near Antarctica that are home to many penguins but no people.One meme featured an altered photo of the explosive February White House meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly clashed with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Instead of a fiery confrontation with the wartime leader, however, Trump and Vance sit next to a black-and-white bird.One person who posted the meme wrote, ""Maybe it didn't say thank you?"" in a possible reference to Vance's accusation that Zelenskyy had not appropriately thanked the United States for the military support Washington had provided Ukraine throughout the war.A different meme showed a penguin teaching sea gulls to aim their waste at Teslas, an apparent nod to Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk. Yet another showed a huge gathering of penguins with a caption citing ""Unprecedented protests"" on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, ""as the population rises up"" against Trump's imposition of across-the-board tariffs.The UNESCO World Heritage Convention notes the islands' ""complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact."" Still, Trump included the desolate islands on his list, imposing the 10% baseline tariff he placed on nearly all goods imported into the United States.The Wednesday announcement, which Trump described as America's ""Liberation Day,"" sent shock waves across the world as both allies and adversaries scrambled to make sense of the new and hefty tariffs. The move has shot U.S. import duties to the highest levels in more than a century.Also slotted for new tariffs were the British Indian Ocean Territory, a collection of mostly uninhabited islands, save for U.S. and British soldiers stationed on joint military bases.Other islands subjected to tariffs included Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand that has fewer than 2,000 inhabitants; the Norwegian islands of Svalbard, which has about 3,000 residents; and Jan Mayen, where the only humans are the military personnel who operate a weather and coastal services station.Trump has said little about the methodology behind the new system of calculations, but each country's new tariff rate appeared to come from a formula that takes the trade deficit America runs with a nation and divides it by the exports that country sent into the United States. The White House explained its methodology in this post, which essentially confirms that formula.Then, because Trump said he was being ""kind,"" the final tariff number was cut in half.It is not clear how the administration decided to add Heard Island and McDonald Islands to the list of tariffs. The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment.","Penguin memes flood the internet after U.S. tariffs on Australian islands.

A 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot and killed by Israeli forces during an incident in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya on Sunday, Palestinian officials said, with Israeli authorities claiming he was among a group of “terrorists” hurling rocks at cars on a nearby highway.According to the town’s mayor, Adeeb Lafi, the teenager, Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee , was shot at the town’s entrance along with two other teens.Mayor Lafi told Reuters the Israeli army later declared Omar dead after detaining him.As per AFP, the Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed its teams transported the teenager’s body to hospital and reported that two other boys were also wounded, one in the abdomen and the other in the thigh. Both were 14 years old, and one of them, Ayoub Asaad, also holds US citizenship, his father told AFP.The Israeli military issued a statement saying soldiers opened fire after spotting “three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.” It said one of the suspects was “eliminated” and two others were wounded.However, the Palestinian foreign ministry strongly condemned the incident, describing it as an “extra-judicial killing” and accusing Israel of “continued impunity.” The ministry further criticised the use of live fire against children , saying Israel’s actions encouraged “further crimes.”Violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified since the Gaza war began on October 7, 2023.According to Palestinian health authorities, at least 918 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers since then, including militants. Meanwhile, Israeli sources say 33 Israelis, including soldiers, have died during raids and attacks in the same period.The town of Turmus Ayya, northeast of Ramallah, is known for its large community of dual Palestinian-American citizens. Witness accounts, such as that of Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, one of the injured teens, contradicted the Israeli military’s version.He told AFP he was collecting fruit when he was shot by a soldier.The father of Ayoub Asaad also claimed their ambulance was delayed at a checkpoint, and that a soldier told him he was the one who shot the three boys.Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and clashes between settlers, armed Palestinians, and Israeli forces have grown more frequent, especially since the escalation in Gaza.","Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee, 14, was shot and killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya on Sunday.

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry. you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new advice read.This is the second major update of Canada's travel rules for the US. The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration. This new rule is effective from April 11.The mandatory registration rules come from an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office, directing the Department of Homeland Security to ensure non-citizens comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations. US authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. Expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices. Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities.

UK PM Keir Starmer acknowledges Trump’s tariff logic but calls them wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-keir-starmer-acknowledges-trumps-tariff-logic-but-calls-them-wrong/articleshow/120034542.cms,"Poll Do you agree with Keir Starmer's stance on tariffs? No, I oppose his view. Yes, I support his view.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump’s latest push for tariffs, even as he maintains that such protectionist measures are the wrong approach, according to The Times.In a speech due to be delivered on Sunday, the Labour leader is set to announce that he recognises why Trump's economic nationalism resonates with many voters. However, he will also argue that tariffs ultimately do more harm than good.“Trump has done something that we don’t agree with but there’s a reason why people are behind him on this,” a spokesperson for the Prime Minister told The Times.“The world has changed, globalization is over and we are now in a new era. We’ve got to demonstrate that our approach, a more active Labour government, a more reformist government, can provide the answers for people in every part of this country,” the spokesperson added, quoted by the New York Post.Starmer will also throw light on what he sees as the end of globalisation, saying that free trade and mass migration, once considered cornerstones of modern economic policy, have failed large sections of the voters.Although Starmer has not yet spoken to President Trump about the newly announced tariffs, he did raise the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron during a phone call on Saturday. Both leaders reportedly agreed that a trade war would benefit no one, though “nothing should be off the table,” according to the report.Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, announced on Wednesday, include a 10% levy on all goods imported from the UK, part of a broader strategy targeting almost every country in the world.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump's latest push for tariffs.

US Senator Bernie Sanders has intensified his criticism of America’s political and economic system, warning that the United States is moving “rapidly toward oligarchy” and calling it a "" pseudo-democracy "" in which billionaires wield disproportionate power over governance.At 83, Sanders is still drawing massive crowds to rallies, energising a new wave of opposition to US President Donald Trump and those backing him financially and politically.As per CBS News, Sanders directly named Elon Musk and Donald Trump as figures driving what he views as a dangerous shift in American democracy. “You can thank Elon Musk and Trump for that,” he said, adding, “These guys, led by Musk... have now allowed billionaires essentially to own our political process.”The senator blamed the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling for enabling this system, where “you get one vote, and Elon Musk can spend $270 million to help elect Trump.”Sanders, an independent from Vermont who previously ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, remains outside the traditional party structure. He has long criticised both Republicans and Democrats for failing to represent working-class Americans. “Sixty percent of our people are living paycheck-to-paycheck. Media doesn't talk about it. We don't talk about it enough here in Congress,” he said.In his interview with CBS, Sanders also took aim at major law firms allegedly reaching financial settlements with the Trump administration . “Absolute cowardice,” he said, accusing firms of selling their souls to maintain influence in Washington.He dismissed any notion of Trump’s third-term talk as a joke. “They don’t believe in the Constitution. So yeah, I would take that seriously,” Sanders said, describing the situation as not just political, but a “moral and constitutional crisis.”Reflecting on his own past, Sanders said his activism stems from growing up in a working-class Jewish family in Brooklyn. “We were never poor; my father worked all the time, just never had any money,” he said. The Holocaust’s lingering presence in his community, including survivors with camp tattoos, shaped his fight against racism and injustice.Despite not being a Democrat, Sanders remains a prominent voice on the left. When asked what the Democratic Party needs to hear, he replied, “Why has the working class in this country largely turned away from them?” He warned the party must choose whether to chase big-money donors or stand with workers.As for a potential 2028 presidential run , Sanders laughed off the idea. “Little bit old to be worrying about those things,” he said, but added that speaking to people across the country is what “keeps me going.”",US Senator Bernie Sanders has intensified his criticism of America’s political and economic system.

A New Jersey woman who killed her two daughters in what she described as a “religious” act to purify the world has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The ruling, delivered last week by Superior Court Judge Guy Ryan, acknowledged Naomi Elkins ’ responsibility for the deaths but deemed her criminally insane at the time of the murders.Elkins, 27, drowned her daughters—aged 1 and 3—in the bathtub of their Lakewood home on June 25. According to prosecutors, she had picked them up from Giggles Daycare, where she also worked, before fatally stabbing the younger child and then drowning her.When the older child witnessed the horror and attempted to hide in a separate bathroom, Elkins followed, started a second bath, and drowned her as well.Psychologist Gianni Pirelli, who testified during the trial, said Elkins suffered from postpartum psychosis and believed she was either the Messiah or a descendant of Hitler. “She thought that if she destroyed her children, she would be destroying all the evil in the world,” he explained.Authorities said Elkins had admitted to the killings, telling investigators she counted to 50 multiple times while holding each child underwater to make sure they were dead. A letter she wrote to her daughters was described as reading “more as a letter to God,” according to Pirelli.“She was undoubtedly psychotic,” he told the court.After committing the murders, Elkins contacted Hatzolah Medical Services and confessed that she had harmed her children. Both were declared dead at the scene.Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer did not contest the insanity ruling. Judge Ryan sentenced Elkins to two life terms—equating to 150 years in a secure psychiatric facility, as mandated under state law. Defense attorney Mitchell Ansell stated that her mental condition will be regularly assessed by the court. Elkins will remain institutionalized unless she is deemed no longer a threat to herself or others.","Naomi Elkins, 27, drowned her daughters, aged 1 and 3, in the bathtub of their Lakewood, New Jersey, home on June 25.

Andry Hernandez Romero , a Venezuelan makeup artist and member of the LGBTQ+ community, came to the United States last year seeking asylum after facing threats in his home country due to his sexuality and political beliefs. After a treacherous journey through the perilous Darien Gap and into Mexico, he legally presented himself at a US border crossing near San Diego and was taken into custody to await the outcome of his asylum application.Romero had passed a credible fear interview—an initial screening in the asylum process—which determined that his claim had merit. “And the government had found that his threats against him were credible and that he had a real probability of winning an asylum claim,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, his attorney.But just weeks ago, Romero vanished from the legal process. ""Our client, who was in the middle of seeking asylum, just disappeared. One day he was there, and the next day we're supposed to have court, and he wasn't brought to court,"" Toczylowski added.Romero is among 238 Venezuelan migrants transferred to El Salvador's high-security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) under a new deportation agreement between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. President Trump, who has vowed to dismantle the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua, utilized the Alien Enemies Act—unused since WWII—to justify the deportations, branding the individuals as terrorists and gang members.Since being flown to El Salvador, Romero’s legal team and loved ones have been unable to contact him. Images captured by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger show Romero inside CECOT. Holsinger recalled hearing a man cry out, ""I'm not a gang member. I'm gay. I'm a stylist,"" before being slapped and forcibly shaved.""It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist, in the most horrible conditions I could imagine,"" said Toczylowski, expressing deep concern for her client's safety. ""We have grave concerns about whether he can survive.""",Andry Hernandez Romero came to the United States last year seeking asylum after facing threats in his home country due to his sexuality and political beliefs.

A 49-year-old man was shot by police on Sunday morning after he allegedly went on a violent rampage with a meat cleaver inside a Brooklyn apartment, slashing and stabbing four young girls before being confronted by officers.According to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, the victims — aged 16, 13, 11, and 8 — sustained serious injuries but are expected to survive. As per news agency AP, the attack was reported around 10:15 am (local time) when the 11-year-old girl, wounded and terrified, locked herself in a room and called 911, saying her uncle had stabbed her and her siblings.The 911 operator used location tracking to pinpoint the address on 84th Street in Bensonhurst. When officers arrived, an uninjured boy led them inside. “At that point, the officers heard screams coming from behind the door to their left and immediately began forcing their way into the apartment,” Tisch said at a press briefing, reported CBS News.Inside, police encountered the suspect, identified as Long Qian Chen , holding a large bloodied meat cleaver. Officers repeatedly ordered him to drop the weapon, but he advanced toward them. “Two officers discharged their firearms, firing seven total rounds between them and striking the subject, ending the threat,” Tisch stated.Authorities also found a second bloodied knife at the scene. The suspect was rushed to hospital in critical condition. A motive is yet to be confirmed, but CBS News cited family members who said Chen has a history of mental illness.“This could have ended very differently,” Tisch noted, praising the 11-year-old for her bravery. “She hid in a room to call the police.” She also confirmed a fifth child, a young boy, ran outside to get help.As per the New York Post, disturbing images showed one of the girls covered in blood from head to toe outside the building. A neighbour, identified only as Maria, said, “I was shaking. I’m still shaking now… The two girls were just covered in blood.”Another neighbour, Humbert Huerta, saw the suspect being wheeled out: “They brought out a guy on a stretcher, all bloody without a shirt… They shot him twice.”Officials believe Chen may be the uncle or possibly the father of some of the children. Tisch confirmed the mother was not home at the time of the attack.State Assemblyman Lester Chang told reporters that one of the victims may have been a babysitter. The investigation is ongoing.","A 49-year-old man was shot by police on Sunday morning after he allegedly went on a violent rampage with a meat cleaver inside a Brooklyn apartment.

The Colorado artist behind a now-removed portrait of US President Donald Trump has denied claims by the president that she deliberately distorted his likeness, saying his comments have caused significant harm to her business.Sarah Boardman, a Colorado Springs-based painter, responded after Trump took aim at her work in a March 23 post on Truth Social. “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado… was purposefully distorted,” Trump wrote. He also claimed the artist “must have lost her talent as she got older,” adding that he preferred no portrait at all to the one that had hung in the Colorado State Capitol.Boardman, who also painted official portraits of Barack Obama and George W Bush displayed in the same gallery, firmly rejected the accusation. As per news agency AP, she said in a statement, “I completed the portrait accurately, without ‘purposeful distortion,’ political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied.”She explained that the Capitol advisory committee selected the reference photograph, monitored the portrait’s progress and approved the final result. “I fulfilled the task per my contract,” she added.The portrait had hung in the Capitol since 2019, funded by $10,000 raised by Colorado Republicans. It was removed the morning after Trump’s remarks and placed in museum storage.As per new agency AFP, the Democrat-led legislature confirmed the decision to take it down followed Trump’s public criticism.While Trump claimed “many people” in Colorado had complained about the painting, Boardman disputed this, saying she had received “overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback” during its six-year display. “That has changed for the worse since President Trump’s comments,” she wrote.Boardman also expressed concern about the personal and professional fallout. “The additional allegations… are now directly and negatively impacting my business of over 41 years which now is in danger of not recovering,” she said.Trump praised the Obama portrait, also painted by Boardman, as looking “wonderful” in contrast to his own, which he described as “truly the worst.”Republican Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen has since said the Trump portrait should be replaced with one that reflects his “contemporary likeness.” However, a replacement has not yet been commissioned.","Sarah Boardman, a Colorado Springs-based painter, responded after Trump took aim at her work in a March 23 post on Truth Social.

Who is Erez Reuveni?

Erez Reuveni is an attorney with nearly 15 years at the US department of justice, where he most recently served as assistant director and briefly as acting deputy director of the office of immigration litigation .



. Reuveni has held multiple roles within the DOJ civil vivision, including senior counsel and trial attorney, handling some of the most sensitive immigration and constitutional law cases under various administrations.



He began his legal career with prestigious clerkships under Judge Jon O Newman on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and Chief Judge Mark Wolf in the District of Massachusetts.



Reuveni also worked as a litigation associate at Morrison & Foerster and was a fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society.



Reuveni holds a JD, summa cum laude, from Boston University School of Law, where he was a finalist in moot court and served as Articles Editor for the Law Review.



He earned his BA, magna cum laude, from Brandeis University in Politics, Economics, and Near Eastern Studies.

Erez Reuveni , a senior Justice Department lawyer, has been placed on paid administrative leave after a high-profile courtroom appearance where he failed to defend the government’s position in the controversial deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland man wrongly sent to El Salvador.As reported by ABC News, the DOJ cited a “failure to zealously advocate” for government interests as the reason for his suspension. Reuveni appeared frustrated and unable to provide legal justification during Friday’s hearing, where Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the deportation was unlawful and ordered Abrego Garcia’s return.According to Politico, Reuveni told the court that he had urged his DOJ superiors to bring Abrego Garcia back and admitted he couldn’t explain why he was detained or labelled as an MS-13 member.The DOJ later removed his name from official filings in the case. Attorney general Pam Bondi publicly criticised Reuveni, saying DOJ attorneys must “zealously advocate on behalf of the United States.” His supervisor, August Flentje, was also placed on leave for failing to oversee Reuveni's conduct.","Erez Reuveni, a senior Justice Department lawyer, has been placed on paid administrative leave after a high-profile courtroom appearance.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia: Federal Judge again orders Trump administration to return man wrongly deported to El Salvador,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-judge-again-orders-trump-administration-to-return-man-wrongly-deported-to-el-salvador/articleshow/120044453.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

A US federal judge has, for the second time, ordered the Trump administration to return a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, despite warnings he would face danger there.The man, 29-year-old Kilmar Abrego Garcia , remains jailed in El Salvador’s infamous Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (Cecot), after being mistakenly sent back last month.In a sharp rebuke, US district Jjdge Paula Xinis on Sunday ruled that the government had no legal grounds to detain or deport Abrego Garcia. “They had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador, let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,” Xinis wrote in her order, as per news agency AP.Abrego Garcia had previously been granted protection from deportation in 2019 by an immigration judge. Despite this, US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) deported him in what the White House has called an “administrative error”. The Trump administration has also tried to link him to the MS-13 gang , though his lawyers say there is no evidence to support that claim.Judge Xinis dismissed government arguments that the courts lacked authority to intervene. “Having confessed grievous error, the defendants now argue that this Court lacks the power to hear this case, and they lack the power to order Abrego Garcia’s return,” she stated in the ruling.Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who represented the government in court, admitted, “We concede he should not have been removed to El Salvador” and when asked why Garcia was held, responded, “I don’t know,” according to AP.Reuveni has since been placed on administrative leave.Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News Sunday, “He’s on administrative leave now and we’ll see what happens,” while likening Reuveni’s courtroom remarks to “a defense attorney walking in, conceding something in a criminal matter.”The department of justice has appealed Judge Xinis’ order to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that compelling the executive branch to act on foreign soil is unconstitutional.The Trump administration said such an order would force the US government to “compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign,” which it called “constitutionally intolerable”.Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a US citizen, has not spoken to her husband since his deportation. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, slammed the government's inaction, saying, “Plenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right,” reported BBC.Judge Xinis has ordered that the government “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return by Monday night.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month. A federal judge has now ordered the government to return him to the US. She ruled that the government had no legal grounds to detain or deport him.

US National Security Breach Yemen: Revealed – How Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg got his name added to Signal war chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/revealed-how-atlantics-jeffrey-goldberg-got-his-name-added-to-signal-war-chat/articleshow/120042286.cms,"File photo: The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg (Picture credit: AP)

A startling error by US national security adviser Mike Waltz reportedly led to The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg being mistakenly added to a top-level Signal chat discussing American strikes in Yemen.According to three unnamed sources quoted by The Guardian, the breach stemmed from a phone contact mix-up traced back to the 2024 campaign, a mishap that US President Donald Trump considered firing Waltz over.The internal White House investigation found that Goldberg’s number was saved on Waltz’s phone under a completely different contact, Brian Hughes, now spokesperson for the National Security Council.The confusion began when Hughes, in October 2024, forwarded Goldberg’s critical email about Trump’s stance on wounded US soldiers to Waltz. The message included Goldberg’s signature block, complete with his phone number.Waltz didn’t contact Goldberg, but somehow his number was saved in the wrong contact card due to an iPhone's contact suggestion algorithm, reported The Guardian.The error went unnoticed until March 13, when Waltz created a Signal group chat called “Houthi PC small group” to coordinate military plans. Intending to add Hughes, Waltz inadvertently added Goldberg.The group included 18 senior officials, among them Vice President JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, secretary of state Marco Rubio and others.Goldberg’s presence was only discovered after sensitive operational messages had already circulated.Despite the gravity of the error, Trump reportedly chose not to fire Waltz, more irritated by the fact that he had Goldberg’s number at all, given Trump’s long-standing contempt for The Atlantic, than by the security lapse itself. He was also reassured by the internal review, which showed no classified data had been shared.Goldberg declined to offer details but told The Guardian, “I’m not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz beyond saying I do know him and have spoken to him.”In public remarks, Waltz said he had “never met, don’t know, never communicated with” Goldberg. On Fox News, he later admitted, “We made a mistake. We’re moving forward,” taking “full responsibility” for the breach and suggesting the contact may have been “sucked in” through iPhone syncing.Trump, addressing the incident during a Newsmax interview, downplayed its impact. “It wasn’t classified, as I understand it,” he said. “The attack was a tremendous success… We feel very comfortable.” He also signalled a retreat from using Signal, saying, “We won’t be using it very much,” advocating instead for in-person meetings with “solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and lead floor.”The episode prompted a forensic review by the White House IT office and drew sympathy from within Trump’s circle, who noted Signal had been authorised for inter-agency communication due to the lack of a secure alternative. Even the Biden administration had failed to implement a replacement, reported The Guardian citing sources.",The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to a top- level Signal chat discussing American strikes in Yemen.

Australian MMA Coach: 'You're treated like worst criminal': Aussie MMA coach claims 'nightmare' US prison ordeal after visa issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youre-treated-like-worst-criminal-aussie-mma-coach-claims-nightmare-us-prison-ordeal-after-visa-issue/articleshow/120041940.cms,"Aussie MMA coach claims 'nightmare' US prison ordeal after visa issue (Picture credit: coachsubotic/Instagram)

Australian MMA coach Renato Subotic claimed he was mistakenly detained and jailed in the United States over a visa issue, describing his experience as a “chaotic” and humiliating ordeal that saw him locked up with violent inmates and denied basic rights.Subotic, who had travelled to the US to conduct a seminar, said the incident has left him shocked at how quickly someone's freedom can be taken away.The 33-year-old, who has coached Australia’s national MMA team, was stopped at the border and taken to an isolated room where he says he was interrogated for three hours. “The officer interviewing me looked like he was looking for something wrong,” Subotic wrote on Instagram, adding that despite being cooperative and providing full details of his trip, he was told there had been a mistake with his visa and he was being taken to jail.Further describing his ordeal, he said that he was handcuffed, stripped of his belongings, and forced into a prison uniform before being taken to a federal facility where he was fingerprinted and photographed. “They walked me to my block – 4B. The moment the door opened, it was chaos. Fights between gangs, people screaming, arguing over food, what to watch on TV, crazy people running around. Madness,” he wrote.Inside the cell, Subotic claimed he was met with a mattress stained with “p*** and blood.” When he later returned to find two men stealing his blanket, a physical altercation broke out.A guard responded and told him, “You got a good welcome. Keep your head straight or you're gonna stay here longer.”The coach remained in detention for around 24 hours before being taken to the airport. “At the airport, they kept me in a room without telling me when I’d fly,” he said. “Eventually, I got info: I was being deported.” Before boarding the plane, Subotic said a federal officer apologised, telling him, “They messed up big. It shouldn’t have gone this way.”Subotic said he respects immigration rules but slammed the decision to imprison him. “It’s insane how easily someone can take away your freedom… Just like that, you’re treated like the worst criminal,” he said, adding that he’s now back in Australia and consulting lawyers.His case comes as US President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration enforcement . As reported by SBS News , the US president recently revoked temporary legal status for over 500,000 immigrants and has faced criticism for detaining foreign visitors for minor visa issues .“I hope this never happens to nobody else,” Subotic said.","Australian MMA coach Renato Subotic claims he was mistakenly detained and jailed in the United States over a visa issue.

Pakistan: Militants make March deadliest month in a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-militants-make-march-deadliest-month-in-a-decade/articleshow/119976734.cms,"(PTI photo)

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

The former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , recognising his contributions to human rights and democratic values.The nomination was announced by members of the Pakistan World Alliance (PWA), an advocacy organisation established in December, who are also affiliated with the Norwegian political party Partiet Sentrum.""We are pleased to announce on behalf of Partiet Sentrum that in alliance with somebody with the right to nominate, have nominated Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, to the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with human rights and democracy in Pakistan,"" Partiet Sentrum posted on X on Sunday.Previously also, Khan received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2019 for his endeavours to foster peace across South Asia.Strangely in his own country, the Centre has claimed that Imran Khan orchestrated the riots in the country.The Norwegian Nobel Committee evaluates hundreds of nominations annually through an extensive eight-month selection process before choosing a winner, according to The Express Tribune.Khan, who established Pakistan's primary opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has been in custody since August 2023.In January, authorities sentenced Khan to 14 years' imprisonment for corruption and misuse of authority charges.This verdict marked his fourth significant conviction.Higher courts have since overturned or suspended three previous convictions related to state gift sales, state secret disclosures, and marriage irregularities.Following a no-confidence vote in April 2022, Khan was removed from office. He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

B'desh says reports of attacks on minorities 'hugely inflated'

PM Modi on Friday asked Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus to ensure safety and security of minorities, including Hindus, in the country and thoroughly investigate ""atrocities"" committed against them.In their first bilateral meeting since the formation of the interim govt in Dhaka in Aug 2024, Modi sought positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh based on pragmatism, and urged Yunus to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.However, as Modi broached the subject of minorities and increasing radicalisation, a Bangladesh readout said, Yunus called for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda and said ties should be shaped on basis of principles like territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.Yunus came to the meeting in Bangkok armed with his own list of issues Dhaka considers important, including the extradition of Sheikh Hasina , border killings, Saarc cooperation and pending Teesta water-sharing agreement. Even in the absence of any assurance that India would consider extraditing the ousted PM, Bangladesh authorities described the meeting as constructive and fruitful, but called upon India to restrain her from making inflammatory statements. Modi touched upon the issue of polls in Bangladesh as he reiterated India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive neighbour. According to Bangladesh, Modi said India's ties are with the country and not with a political party or organisation.PM Modi underlined that India believed in a people-centric approach to the relationship and highlighted the cooperation between the two countries over a long period that has delivered tangible benefits to people in both countries,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri.According to Misri, the PM spoke at length about the issue of minorities, expressing deep concern over their plight and telling Yunus how violence against them impacts society in India too. He expressed hope Bangladesh would be able to fulfil its responsibility of protecting minority communities.However, the minority issue remained a sticking point as Yunus, according to the Bangladesh readout of the meeting, said the reports of attacks on minorities were hugely inflated and ""the bulk of them were fake news"". He asked Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.""The chief adviser said he has instituted an effective system for monitoring every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his govt was taking serious actions to stop any occurrence of such incidents,"" said Dhaka in a statement.While calling for Hasina to be extradited, Yunus also accused the former PM of destabilising Bangladesh through her ""inflammatory"" statements from India, calling it an abuse of the hospitality extended to her by the Indian govt. He also accused Hasina of committing crimes against humanity, citing a UN report about the human rights violations under her govt.""We request that Indian govt take appropriate measures to restrain her from continuing to make such incendiary statements while she remains in your country,"" said Yunus. Interestingly, according to Dhaka, Modi blamed social media for tensions over Hasina's remarks and said India doesn't have special preference for any party or individual.He also said Bangladesh remained thankful for the ""unwavering support"" of the govt and people of India during its most challenging time in 1971. ""Excellency, we seek to work together with you to set the relationship on the right track for the benefit of both our peoples,"" said Yunus, according to Bangladesh.While Yunus raised the issue of border killings, Modi told him strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal border crossings, especially at night, are necessary for maintaining border security and stability. The Bangladesh readout quoted Modi as saying Indian border troops opened fire only in self-defence and the fatalities occurred in Indian territories. Yunus stressed it is important to address this issue to build trust between the countries.""PM expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of their long standing and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship,"" said the Indian govt. Modi also congratulated Yunus for taking over as Bimstec Chair and Yunus sought India's support for a free trade agreement that the inter-regional group is discussing.",PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit. Yunus calls for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda. He asks Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves. He also accuses Hasina of committing crimes against humanity.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119993507,imgsize-1315422,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-57.jpg"
UK Nurse Suspended: UK nurse claims she was suspended for ‘misgendering’ trans prisoner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-nurse-claims-she-was-suspended-for-misgendering-trans-prisoner/articleshow/120043967.cms,"File photo: Suspended nurse Jennifer Melle (Picture credit: X)

A senior NHS nurse on Sunday was suspended after addressing a transgender paedophile as ""Mister"" and later speaking publicly about the incident. Jennifer Melle, 40, was escorted from St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, in tears following a short meeting with a manager last week, Daily Mail reported.Ms Melle, a devout Christian originally from Uganda, claims she was punished for whistleblowing , despite being subjected to racist abuse by the patient. “I am devastated to have been suspended just for whistleblowing,” she was quoted saying by The Daily Mail.“Despite being the one placed at risk, I am the one being punished. The message I have received is clear: I am expected to tolerate racism, deny biological reality and suppress my deeply held Christian beliefs.”The patient, known only as Patient X, was a convicted sex offender brought to the ward from a high-security men’s prison for treatment. During an evening shift, Ms Melle referred to the patient as “he” and “Mister” while discussing a catheter procedure with a doctor, explaining it was “a medical scenario that required accurate terminology.”The patient, who identifies as a woman, became enraged and verbally assaulted the nurse.According to The Telegraph, Ms Melle recalled the patient shouting, “Imagine if I called you n-----? How about I call you n-----? Yes, black n-----,” before lunging at her.Despite this abuse, it was Ms Melle who was disciplined last year with a final warning and referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). The NHS trust has now suspended her over a “potential breach” of patient confidentiality, after she spoke to the media about her experience.Ms Melle has launched legal proceedings against Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, alleging harassment, discrimination and human rights violations . The Christian Legal Centre, which is backing her claim, described her treatment as “blatant, unlawful victimisation.”“This is a legally protected act under the Equality Act,” said Andrea Williams, the group’s chief executive. “The NHS has become so entrenched in transgender ideology that it is willing to side with a man brought in from prison in chains – who was shouting racist abuse – over a Christian nurse”, Wiliams added.The case has sparked political backlash. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called Ms Melle’s suspension “completely crazy,” adding, “She has my full support. It’s time the Government pulls its finger out and intervenes to make it clear no one should be punished at work for stating biological reality to paedophiles.”A spokesperson for the NHS trust said staff are expected to uphold professional standards, including confidentiality, and confirmed Ms Melle’s complaints were under investigation. “There is no excuse for racially abusing our staff, and we’re sorry that Ms Melle had this experience,” the spokesperson was quoted saying by The Telegraph. “As proceedings are still ongoing, it wouldn’t be right for us to comment further”, the spokesperson added.","Jennifer Melle, 40, was escorted from St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, in tears following a short meeting with a manager last week.
