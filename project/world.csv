Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior govt source.India had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by PM Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence . Trudeau had addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto Sunday attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.On the sidelines of the event, he told the media the killing of Nijjar created a ""problem"" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.""PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,"" external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in News Delhi at his weekly media at a briefing.""This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,"" he added, when asked about Trudeau's remarks.India on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of 'pro-Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau.","Members of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia.

The deceased was identified as S Kasthuri, 22, a nursing graduate from Chennai, wife of Suresh Kumar from Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district.Relatives blamed the emergency chain that failed to work for the delay in rescuing and providing medical treatment to the woman and her subsequent death.Railway police while quoting her relatives said Kasthuri along with her husband and relatives left Chennai for Sankarankoil in Kollam Express on Thursday. The pregnant woman's baby shower ceremony was scheduled on Sunday at Sankarankoil. When the speeding express train crossed Ulundurpet railway station, Kasthuri complained of nausea and vomiting. She was assisted by one of her relatives to the door when she lost control and fell from the speeding train.Her relatives attempted to stop the train by pulling the emergency chain. They said the emergency chain in the compartment did not work, and they could not stop the train immediately. They rushed to the next compartment and pulled the emergency chain to stop the train. By then the train travelled almost 10km from where the pregnant woman fell. They got down and tried to trace Kasthuri. Their 20-minute search turned futile, and the train departed and reached Vridhachalam railway station.Her relatives went to Vridhachalam railway station and lodged a complaint with the railway police. A police team found her body along the tracks about 1km from Ulundurpet railway station after a three-hour search. Her relatives said Kasthuri could have been saved if the emergency chain in the compartment had worked and they could have rescued the injured woman and rushed her for immediate medical treatment. They pointed out that it took almost three hours to locate her after she fell from the train.Meanwhile, the district administration has ordered an inquiry by the RDO as the woman died within eight months of marriage to rule out any foul play in the tragic death of the woman.","The deceased was identified as S Kasthuri, 22, a nursing graduate from Chennai, wife of Suresh Kumar from Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district.

Appropriate legal action will be taken against them as per assigned norms of the pollution control board,” he said.On this occasion, school children who exhibited self-painted posters and drawings to disseminate the message of pollution eradication for the sake of a healthy equilibrium of the environment were awarded by the SP.The drive was also joined by retired Army colonel PS Bindra. Pointing out the key reason for a common practice of people to throw plastic waste like packing material of pasteurised milk, chips, and edible oils, etc., Col Bindra said that, unlike old newspapers and cardboard sheets, polythene is generally not procured by junk dealers.“I will engage my social group, ‘Parivartan’, to set up a smooth network for selling waste polythene and plastic to let people earn money from other junk material.

Voters swing to labour in English local elections: Key takeaways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/voters-swing-to-labour-in-english-local-elections-key-takeaways/articleshow/109830470.cms,"The Conservatives could be in serious trouble.

Labour's 'red wall' is returning to the fold

The election showed how Reform UK may siphon votes from the Conservatives

New voting regulations went well. (Just not for Johnson.)

While the votes in local elections in England and Wales were still being counted Friday, a picture has begun to emerge of significant losses for the governing Conservative Party .The voting Thursday to elect councilors, mayors and police commissioners in local elections, seen as a last test of public opinion before a general election expected later this year, portends a difficult road ahead for the party.Here are four takeaways.Leading up to the local elections, the question was not whether the Conservatives would suffer, but just how bad the blow might be. The party has trailed Labour, the main opposition party, in opinion polls for some time, after a series of scandals, the implosion of Boris Johnson 's administration and the embarrassment of the 45-day prime ministership of Liz Truss, leading many Britons to look elsewhere for leadership.By midday Friday, the early results suggested that the party might have fared even more poorly than its leaders had feared. When all is said and done, some analysts think the Conservatives could lose as many as 500 council seats, a signal of serious trouble ahead for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's beleaguered Conservative Party.About one-third of England's council seats were contested, along with 11 mayoral seats in major English metro areas. Although these elections were about local leadership, the results of Thursday's vote serve as an important barometer of overall public opinion, and ultimately a test of whether the Conservative Party can retain power in a general election expected this fall.Labour won control of a number of key councils, including Hartlepool, Thurrock, Rushmoor and Redditch, all of which were seen as battleground races that could gauge broader public sentiment.However, the Conservatives had some notable wins to cling to, including the Tees Valley mayoral race, where incumbent Ben Houchen received the majority of the vote, albeit with a much smaller percentage than in his last election.The election made clear that the opposition Labour Party was succeeding in winning back its longtime supporters in the working-class areas of northern England -- often called the ""red wall"" for their entrenched support for Labour, whose party color is red -- who had defected over Brexit and immigration.After Labour won control of the council in Hartlepool, a party representative said, ""Making gains here shows that the party is on track to win a general election and is firmly back in the service of working people.""In Blackpool South, a deprived seaside district, the Labour Party easily took a parliamentary by-election held Thursday after a Conservative lawmaker stepped down. The seat had long been held by Labour, but it was won by the Conservatives in 2019.Keir Starmer , the Labour Party leader, said the win was a message sent directly by the public to Sunak ""to say we're fed up with your decline, your chaos, your division, and we want change.""But Labour also faced some pushback, possibly as an effect of its staunch support for Israel in the war in the Gaza Strip and a delay in calling for a cease-fire, that could dampen the party's gains in some northern places, a senior Labour figure, Pat McFadden, acknowledged to Sky News. Notably, the party lost control of the Oldham Council, where a large Muslim population seemed to shift its votes to independent candidates, he added.Reform UK, a right-wing party founded by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, ran relatively few candidates in the elections. But their performance in some key races suggested that they could have a major effect on the general election.In the Blackpool South election, which was overwhelmingly won by the Labour candidate, Chris Webb, Reform UK received nearly as many votes as the Conservatives, with a margin of just 117 votes between the two (3,218 to 3,101.)The results seemingly confirmed opinion polls that put the party third behind Labour and the Tories, underscoring the threat it could pose to the Conservatives in the upcoming general election.Thursday's vote was the first test of new voting regulations stemming from the Elections Act of 2022, and election monitors said the process went smoothly, with some notable exceptions.The vote marked the first time in England that every voter needed to show photo identification, and Johnson, the former prime minister, was reportedly turned away from his polling place after arriving without it, according to Sky News. He later returned with the necessary identification and voted.Some veterans complained that they were unable to use veteran's identification cards to vote, as they were not an approved form of photo identification. Johnny Mercer, the minister of veterans' affairs, said in a post on the social media platform X that he was sorry it had become an issue. He vowed that the cards would be accepted in the next election.But Britain's Electoral Commission, the independent body that oversees the election, said in a statement that ""most voters who wanted to vote were able to do so,"" and that it would ""identify any potential obstacles to participation.""","Local elections in England and Wales were held Thursday.

Police in Manhattan cleared an encampment at New York University after sunrise, with video posted to social media by an official showing protesters exiting their tents and dispersing when ordered by loudspeaker.The scene appeared relatively calm compared to crackdowns at other campuses in the country.University administrators, who have tried to balance the right to protest and complaints of violence and hate speech, have increasingly called on police to clear out the protesters ahead of year-end exams and graduation ceremonies - and some clashes with counter-protesters.More than 2,000 arrests have been made in the past two weeks across the US, some during violent confrontations with police, giving rise to accusations of over-use of force. President Joe Biden gave his first expansive remarks on the protests Thursday, saying that ""order must prevail"". ""We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent. But neither are we a lawless country. We're a civil society, and order must prevail,"" Biden said.His remarks came hours after police moved in on demonstrators at UCLA, which had seen a violent confrontation when counter-protesters attacked a fortified encampment there.On the east coast, protesters at New Jersey's Rutgers University agreed to take down their camp after reaching a compromise with administrators, similar to deal at other institutions, including Brown University. afp","Pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked US campuses for weeks were more muted Friday.

Israeli officials weigh sharing power with Arab states in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-officials-weigh-sharing-power-with-arab-states-in-gaza/articleshow/109829376.cms,"For months, PM Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has avoided detailed public discussion about Gaza's post-war future. Trying to placate both his far-right allies, who seek to rebuild Israeli settlements in Gaza, and Israel's foreign partners, who want Gaza returned to Palestinian governance, Netanyahu has stopped short of any specific declaration.Behind the scenes, however, senior officials in his office have been weighing an expansive plan for post-war Gaza, in which Israel would offer to share oversight of the territory with an alliance of Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as the US, according to three Israeli officials and five people who discussed the plan with members of the Israeli govt.According to that proposal, Israel would do so in exchange for normalised relations between itself and Saudi Arabia, according to the people.Far-right members of Netanyahu's coalition are almost certain to dismiss such an idea, and so are the Arab countries mentioned as possible participants. But it is the clearest sign yet that officials of Israel's govt are thinking about Gaza's future, and could be a starting point in future negotiations.Arab officials and analysts have called the power-sharing plan unworkable because it does not create an explicit path toward a Palestinian state, which the Emirati and Saudi govts have said is a prerequisite for their involvement in post-war planning. But others have cautiously welcomed the proposal as it at least suggests greater flexibility among Israeli leaders than their public statements suggest.Under the proposal, the Arab-Israeli alliance, working with the US, would appoint Gazan leaders to redevelop the devastated territory, overhaul its education system and maintain order. After 7-10 years, the alliance would allow Gazans to vote on whether to be absorbed into a united Palestinian administration that would govern in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the proposal. In the meantime, the plan suggests, the Israeli military could continue to operate inside Gaza. nyt","Senior officials in Netanyahu's office have been weighing an expansive plan for post-war Gaza.

Like-minded protestors at University College London set up an encampment. And tents with Palestinian flags stretched out this week across campuses in Australia. The tensions gripping universities in the US appear to be spreading to other countries, where students have challenged their schools' stances on war in Gaza and ties to Israel.Demonstrators at universities in France have put pressure on administrators to more forcefully condemn Israel's military offence in Gaza and review partnerships with Israeli universities and private donors. Police officers went into Sciences Po Friday to clear out a group of pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied a campus building and refused to leave until their demands were met, according to a statement from the university. The intervention came after a town hall debate about the war at the university failed to defuse tensions.The university said students had breached an agreement not to disrupt classes and exams, and that it had made the ""difficult decision"" to involve police after multiple attempts at dialogue failed. Live video on Instagram showed students chanting, ""We ask for justice! We get the police!"" as officers pulled them out.In Britain, small encampments have begun to spring up at universities in Bristol, Newcastle and Warwick. And a coalition of students and staff at University College London put up tents on the campus grounds on Thursday to pressure the school to divest from companies complicit in what they called ""the genocide of Palestinians,"" among other demands.A union representing students at Trinity College Dublin said the university had fined it more than 214,000 euros, about $230,000, for losses incurred because of disruptive protests since last Sept, rising student fees and other issues. The university, a non-profit, cited the ""negative financial impact"" of protests blocking visitor access to the Book of Kells, a Medieval religious manuscript held at the university. Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the students' union at Trinity College, said the union could not afford the fine. He called it an attempt at intimidation, adding that the protests would continue. ""We will be escalating,"" he said.In Australia, encampments have come up at major universities in Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. These protests have grown more tense as pro-Israel demonstrators have gathered nearby. University administrators have said they support students' right to protest, while warning them to abide by school policies.In Canada, encampments have sprung up in some of the country's largest universities, including universities of Toronto, British Columbia and Ottawa. Organisers at University of Toronto said the encampment will stay until the university discloses its investments, divests from any that ""sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and illegal settlement of Palestine"" and ends partnerships with some Israeli academic institutions. At Montreal's McGill University, the administration requested police intervention to dismantle camps, but law enforcement instead said it was monitoring the situation.","Pro-Palestinian students at one of France's most elite universities, Sciences Po, occupied a campus building overnight.

"In a first, an orangutan is seen using medicinal plant to treat a wound",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-a-first-an-orangutan-is-seen-using-medicinal-plant-to-treat-a-wound/articleshow/109829227.cms,"Scientists observed a wild male orangutan repeatedly rubbing chewed-up leaves of a medicinal plant on a facial wound in a forest reserve in Indonesia.It’s the first known observation of a wild animal using a plant to treat a wound, and adds to evidence that humans are not alone in using plants for medicinal purposes.The male orangutan, Rakus , lives in Gunung Leuser National Park on the island of Sumatra and is thought to be around 35 years old.For years researchers have followed orangutans like him on his travels through the forest, threading his way through the canopy in search of fruits to eat.Scientists first noticed a wound on Rakus’ face on June 25, 2022, when they saw his self-medication behaviour begin.“Once I heard about it, I got extremely excited,” said Isabelle Laumer, a primatologist with Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour in Germany, in part because records of animals medicating themselves are rare — even more so when it comes to treating injuries. She and colleagues detailed the discovery in a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.The plant Rakus used, known as akar kuning or yellow root, is used by people throughout Southeast Asia to treat malaria, diabetes and other conditions. Research shows it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.Orangutans rarely eat the plant. But in this case, Rakus ingested a small amount and also coated the wound several times. Five days after the wound was noticed, it had closed, and less than a month later “healed without any signs of infection,” Dr Laumer said.Primates have been observed appearing to treat wounds in the past, but not with plants. A group of more than two dozen chimpanzees in Gabon in Central Africa have been seen chewing up and applying flying insects to their wounds, said Simone Pika, an expert on animal cognition at Osnabruck University in Germany who documented that observation.Orangutans have been spotted using medicinal plants in a different way: In 2017, six orangutans in Borneo rubbed chewed-up leaves of a shrub with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties onto their legs and arms, probably to soothe sore muscles.Dr Laumer hopes the study of Rakus will help create more appreciation — and desire to protect — the Sumatran orangutan, a critically endangered species. “There are so many things we still don’t know about these apes,” she said.","The male orangutan, Rakus, lives in Gunung Leuser National Park on the island of Sumatra.

"Pro-Palestine protests: Fresh stir in US college campuses, over 2,300 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestine-protests-fresh-stir-in-us-college-campuses-over-2000-arrested/articleshow/109801954.cms,"NEW DELHI: Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday, following weeks of demonstrations and police crackdowns at college campuses nationwide that have resulted in more than 2,300 arrests.About a dozen protesters who refused police orders to leave were arrested and about 30 more left voluntarily, according to NYU spokesperson John Beckman.The school asked the New York Police Department to intervene “to minimize the likelihood of injury"" and disruption, Beckman said.Classes will proceed as scheduled on Friday, he said. A larger NYU encampment was dismantled on April 22, when more than 130 protesters were arrested.The protests and arrests have taken place in nearly every part of the country, but in the last 24 hours, the University of California, Los Angeles has been the center of attention, where tumultuous scenes unfolded early Thursday as officers in riot gear clashed with protesters.At UCLA, hundreds of demonstrators refused to comply with orders to disperse, with some creating human chains as police used flash-bangs to disperse the crowds.Later on Thursday morning, workers cleared the protesters' fortified encampment, removing barricades and using bulldozers to collect trash and tents. Some buildings were covered with graffiti.The protests began at Columbia University on April 17, with students demanding an end to the Israel-Hamas conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the health ministry there. Israel initiated its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed approximately 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and took around 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7.UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated on Thursday that the encampment had become ""a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption,"" endangering people on campus, preventing students from attending classes, forcing building closures, and leading to class cancellations.California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the UCLA campus in large numbers early Thursday, wearing protective gear and using batons to separate themselves from protesters, who were equipped with helmets and gas masks and chanted, ""You want peace. We want justice.""Officers warned protesters for hours that they would be arrested if they did not disperse, and there were scuffles and shoving between protesters and police. Police helicopters circled overhead, and the sound of flash-bangs filled the air. As arrests were made, police removed protesters' helmets and goggles.The law enforcement response and ongoing warnings contrasted with the events of Tuesday night, when counter-demonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing objects, using pepper spray, and tearing down barriers. The fighting continued for hours before police intervened, resulting in no arrests but at least 15 injured protesters. The lukewarm response from authorities drew criticism from various groups and leaders.By Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, with hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set, while others chanted “we’re not leaving” or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas.Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers — some of whom are Jewish — call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.US President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the students’ right to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.Meanwhile, a Police officer fired the gun while clearing protesters from Columbia University administration building earlier this week.More than 100 protesters were taken into custody during Columbia's crackdown on Tuesday. They are part of more than 2,000 people who have been arrested during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks.Columbia's demonstrators had seized Hamilton Hall early on Tuesday, ramping up their presence on the campus from a tent encampment that had been there since April 17. The encampment was one of the earliest on college campuses.Despite more than 100 arrests on April 18 and the clearing of the tents, the protesters defied threats of suspension to return to the encampment. Then they escalated their demonstration by occupying Hamilton Hall, an administration building that was similarly seized in 1968 by students protesting racism and the Vietnam War.(With inputs from agencies)","Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday.

He further added, ""There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline,"" and included a link to the Hims careers page.Dudum's post received a critical response from Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir Technologies and current founder and managing partner of 8VC, an early-stage venture capital firm. Lonsdale argued that ""Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-US and other woke pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.""In recent days, students across numerous campuses in the United States have gathered or established encampments to protest against Israel's ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has now entered its seventh month.

White House

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has called Japan and India “xenophobic” countries that do not welcome immigrants , lumping the two with adversaries China and Russia as he tried to explain their economic circumstances and contrasted the four with the US on immigration .The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.There was no immediate reaction from either the Japanese or Indian governments.Biden’s Xenophobia remark came just three weeks after the White House hosted Japanese PM Fumio Kishida for a lavish official visit, during which the two leaders celebrated what Biden called an “unbreakable alliance ,” particularly on global security matters. Japan is a critical US ally.The White House welcomed PM Narendra Modi for a state visit last summer. And India is a vital partner in the Indo-Pacific despite differences on human rights.At a hotel fundraiser where the donor audience was largely Asian-American, Biden said the upcoming US election was about “freedom, America and democracy” and that the nation’s economy was thriving “because of you and many others”. “Why? Because we welcome immigrants,” Biden said. “Look, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they’re xenophobic. They don’t want immigrants.” The president added: “Immigrants are what makes us strong. Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.”White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was making a broader point about the US posture on immigration. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how Prez Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation and the capabilities that they bring across the spectrum on a range of issues, not just security related,” Kirby said Thursday when asked about Biden’s “xenophobic” remarks. White House press secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said, “The broader case that he was trying to make, which most leaders and allies across the globe understand that when it comes to who we are as a nation, we are a nation of immigrants. That is in our DNA. You have heard the prez say it, it makes us better, and we are stronger for it and that is a very important point to know.”",The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.

"Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine, says US; Kremlin denies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-using-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-says-us-kremlin-denies/articleshow/109799225.cms,"The US has accused Russia of using chemical weapons , including poison gas, “as a method of warfare” against Ukrainian forces, in violation of a global ban on the use of such weapons.The state department said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia had used chloropicrin , a “choking agent” widely used during World War I, as well as tear gas , against Ukrainian troops.The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” the state department said.The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes and four companies that support them.Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, called the accusations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons “odious and unsubstantiated” in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow remained bound by its obligations under the treaty that bans chemical weapons. “As always, such announcements are absolutely unfounded... Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area,” he said.The Ukrainian authorities have reported hundreds of cases of suspected chemical weapons use on the battlefield by Russia since invasion began in Feb 2022. Lt. Col. Artem Vlasiuk, an expert in the Ukrainian army department that deals with nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological security, said that about 250 cases of suspected chemical weapons use by Russian forces had been reported in Feb, about five times the number in March 2023. He said that most of the chemical substances used in the attacks had been identified as CS gas, a tear gas commonly used by riot police to control crowds.Although govts use tear gas for domestic law-enforcement purposes, it is considered a chemical weapon when used in warfare, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Civilians can usually escape tear gas during protests, but soldiers in trenches have little choice but to flee under enemy fire or risk being suffocated.Gyunduz Mamedov, Ukraine ’s deputy prosecutor general, said last week that the Russian army had used tear gas against Ukrainian troops at least 900 times in the past six months, with more than 1,400 incidents reported since the start of the war. In addition to tear gas, the state department said that Russian forces had used chloropicrin, a choking agent that irritates the nose, throat and the lungs when inhaled and can cause nausea and vomiting. Ukrainian army officials have said that the chemicals are usually contained in grenades that Russian forces throw at Ukrainian positions, forcing soldiers out of their fortified positions.",The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country. He said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him. Khan said the cash-strapped country was at a ‘dangerous crossroads’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109821521,imgsize-10382,width-400,resizemode-4/109821521.jpg"

According to Pakistan’s Institute Of Space Technology (IST), the moon-bound spacecraft is a lunar cubesat , designated ICube Qamar ( ICUBE-Q ), with a three-month mission span.The mission is a collaborative effort of IST’s faculty and students, Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco and China’s Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).In 2022, China National Space Agency (CNSA) had offered member-states a unique opportunity through Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (APSCO) to send a student-built payload to the moon on board the Change’6 mission. Pakistan’s ICUBE-Q was selected.According to IST, ICUBE-Q weighs approximately 7kg and is equipped with two optical cameras to capture the lunar surface. It features systems for attitude control, thermal management and deep-space communication.IST lists the main mission objectives as follows -- successful separation of ICUBE-Q CubeSat into lunar orbit from Change’6 Orbiter; use of Orbiter camera to record the release process of ICUBE-Q; successful reception of beacon signal from ICUBE-Q, confirming successful operation of CubeSat.Pictures will also be taken of the orbiter, earth and the moon, apart from two to three objects (moon, earth and orbiter) together, IST said.Change’6 will land on the far side of the moon, collect up to 2000 grams of lunar material and return to earth in a first-of-its-kind mission.","Pakistan is set to embark Friday on its maiden lunar mission on board China’s Change’6 orbiter.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

'Borrowing water'

Zay Yar Tun fills his truck with water for delivery to refugees in the parched hills of war-ravaged eastern Myanmar, where a heatwave is adding to the misery of life in displacement camps.Under a roof of plastic sheets in one of the camps in Kayah state, Augusta waits for the 10 gallons that must cover her family's drinking, cooking and washing needs for the next three days.More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah by the conflict unleashed by the military's 2021 coup, according to the United Nations .Now, a heatwave that has sent the mercury in Myanmar to 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in some places has added to uncertainties of life in the camps.""Last year, we got water from a spring nearby,"" Augusta told AFP.""But now we can't get water from that place as there is no water left there.""We have to be frugal... If we don't shower today, maybe tomorrow we can wash our hands and faces.""The scarcity means she and her children are often unable to wash properly or clean their clothes in the baking heat.""The children are itching and they seem dirty, and we also don't have clean clothes for them,"" she said.A dozen or so camp residents queue up at the truck for water rations that will have to last them three or four days.Children carry the containers home in baskets on their backs or via trolleys as hot wind whips up dust from the dirt road.""When there were only residents living in this place, there was enough water,"" said Zay Yar Tun, of the charity Clean Yangon.""But after the displaced people fled here, the population is too much for the amount of water we can get here.""Donations keep Zay Yar Tun's team and its two trucks running, and they make two deliveries to the camp each week.Finding the streams or springs to fill up their truck can be dangerous in Kayah, which has emerged as one of the hotspots of resistance to military rule.The military regularly calls in air and artillery strikes on its opponents and landmines are a constant danger.Transporting cargo to the camps is difficult too.The fuel the team needs to run their trucks and pumps is expensive because of military restrictions on importing fuel into Kayah, Zay Yar Tun said.""The price of fuel is very expensive, and it seems like we are exchanging fuel to get water,"" he said.Families like Augusta's are forced to make similar calculations as they try to get through the heat.""If we are going to take a bath in the creek, we have to go far away from the camp,"" she said.""It's not a walkable distance under this temperature.""""If we go by motorcycle, it's not worth it because of the cost of fuel.

The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed. The UN mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying a child was among the victims.

Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem.""
