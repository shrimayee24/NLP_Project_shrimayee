Karnataka 1st state to notify Supreme Court order on 'right to die with dignity',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-1st-state-to-notify-supreme-court-order-on-right-to-die-with-dignity/articleshow/117802808.cms,"BENGALURU: In a historic decision, Karnataka government, in compliance with a Jan 2023 Supreme Court ruling on withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, has permitted the 'right to die with dignity' for terminally ill patients with no hope of recovery or those in a persistent vegetative state and no longer benefitting from life-sustaining treatment.In a formal order issued Thursday, state govt said any neurologist, neurosurgeon, surgeon, anaesthetist or intensivist, who has been approved by the appropriate authority under the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, would be deemed to have been nominated by the district health officer (DHO) as a member of secondary boards of medical experts to certify such deaths.The SC guidelines had stipulated that two boards will oversee such cases: a primary board at the hospital level and a secondary board at the district level, with DHO or his/her nominee being part of the district-level board.The order is applicable to all medical establishments, including private and govt-run facilities across the state where such patients are admitted.Dr Roop Gursahani, a neurologist at Mumbai's PD Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre, who has been associated with the movement for dignified death, told TOI that Karnataka has become the first state to allow dignified death for the terminally ill. ""While Goa, Maharashtra and Kerala have passed some rules and directives, the efforts have been patchy,"" he added.Karnataka's health and family welfare minister Dinesh Gundu Rao told TOI that the decision ""will be beneficial to both doctors as well as family of the patients"" who have no chances of recovery.The minister clarified that the decision is not to be confused with euthanasia, and ""is applicable only to those who are on life support system and non-responsive to life-sustaining treatment"".Rao pointed out that Karnataka has also come out with an advance medical directive (AMD) which is like a living will whereby patients can even record their wishes about their medical treatment in future. ""As part of AMD, the patient must also nominate two people to take healthcare decisions on his or her behalf in case they lose their decision-making capacity. This document will come in handy for medical professionals to decide on the kind of medical treatment that the patient may or may not need,"" he explained.","Karnataka has become the first state to allow dignified death for the terminally ill.

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, Rashtrapati Bhavan Friday deplored Sonia Gandhi's comment that President Droupadi Murmu had got tired delivering her address to Parliament's joint sitting while PM Modi said the remarks on a tribal woman smacked of the arrogance of the ""dynasty"".A Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson called Sonia's remarks ""in poor taste, unfortunate and entirely avoidable"".It's rare for President's office to comment on political matters.Sonia made the remark to her children, Rahul and Priyanka, soon after Murmu's inaugural address to the session. ""The poor lady, the President, was getting very tired by the end... she could hardly speak, poor thing,"" Sonia was heard saying in a video that immediately started doing the rounds on social media, triggering a furore, with BJP leaders lashing out at her for ""insulting"" the first tribal President.As per the video clip, Sonia Gandhi's remarks were in response to Rahul asking her if the President's speech was ""boring... repeating the same thing"".Soon, Rashtrapati Bhavan, usually stoic in the face of criticism, stepped in. ""Rashtrapati Bhavan would like to clarify that nothing could be farther from the truth. The President was not tired at any point. Indeed, she has believed that speaking up for the marginalised communities, for women and farmers, as she was doing during the course of her address, can never be tiring. The President's office believes it might be the case that these leaders have not acquainted themselves with the idiom and discourse in Indian languages such as Hindi, and thus formed a wrong impression. In any case, such comments are in poor taste, unfortunate and entirely avoidable,"" press secretary to the President Ajay Kumar Singh said.While addressing a public meeting, Modi reacted to comments by Sonia: ""These Congress people think they are the masters of the country. The arrogance of the Congress royal family has once again been exposed. Today, our President, Droupadi Murmu ji, addressed Parliament. Coming from a tribal family in Odisha, she rose from the tribal region to represent the nation. Despite not speaking Hindi as her mother tongue, but Odia, she delivered an inspiring speech.""He said Congress functionaries belittled Murmu. ""The royal family of Congress stooped to a new low. One member called her speech 'boring' and another went further, calling her 'poor' and 'tired'. This is an insult to the 10 crore tribal brothers and sisters of this country.""BJP chief JP Nadda, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan too joined in their condemnation of Sonia, leading Priyanka to step out in her mother's defence.

Pannun used Sikhs for Justice role as cover to inflict war on India: Tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-used-sfj-role-as-cover-to-inflict-war-on-india-tribunal/articleshow/117790552.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), banned as an “unlawful association” under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act , is a frontal organisation of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , who as the outfit’s legal adviser is using his “juristic identity” as a cover to perpetrate war upon India in league with other agencies and state-and non-state actors of foreign countries, a tribunal led by Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta ruled while upholding the ban on the pro-Khalistani outfit earlier this month.The background note submitted by the government to the tribunal, detailing the activities of SFJ, states that the all activities of the outfit are usually carried out from offices of Pannun, an attempt on whose life in the US, allegedly involving a former Indian government officer, had become an irritant in Indo-US tied until they agreed to cooperate on the case, with a panel set up by India recently recommending “legal action” against the “individual”.The government of India’s background note on SFJ and Pannun, submitted before the tribunal, records that the outfit has repeatedly threatened India’s political leaders, government officers including the police, diplomats, judiciary and even their family members and families abroad. These include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister and minister of Punjab, national security adviser, and RAW chief. The note reveals that SFJ organises protests and filing of baseless cases against visiting Indian dignitaries abroad, particularly in Europe, Canada and US, to defame them and to fan anti-India sentiments among the Sikh diaspora.Stating that SFJ has been organising anti-India protests outside Indian embassies or consulates, where its activists have raised Khalistan flags and even dishonoured the Indian flag and indulged in violence and vandalisation of the premises, the documents filed with the tribunal reveal that many of the protests had the active support of Pakistani missions and were in tandem with multiple ISI-backed Pakistani diaspora outfits and Kashmiri diaspora. They also said Hindu temples in Canada and Australia were defaced with Khalistani graffiti and ISIS exhorted by SFJ after the deadly ISIS attack on Gurdwara Kart-e-Parwan in Kabul, Afghanistan, to target the Indian embassies rather than gurdwaras.The note directly names Pannun for having instigated the Indian farmers protesting against the three farm bills to arm themselves and fight against the Indian forces with weapons that would reach them from across the border (Pakistan). It said he has conspired with other Khalistani leaders like UK-based Babbar Khalsa International leader Paramjit Singh Pamma as well as Canada based terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in 2023, to revive terrorism in Punjab.SFJ, according to the government’s submission, has been inciting Sikh personnel to desert the Army and police forces. He had urged Sikh Soldiers to join the SFJ movement and offered them Rs 5000 more than the salary given by the Indian government. He also tried to provoke the Sikh soldiers posted in Ladakh to not to fight for India against Chinese aggression.SFJ has also been colluding with the gangsters, terrorists and other radical elements including Kashmir separatists. Not only this, it has been inciting non-Sikh communities including Muslims and Tamils, as also Christians in Manipur to secede from India.As many as 104 cases have been registered against SFJ elements, including 96 by various state police and 8 by NIA.“Vitriolic speeches made by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun glorifying militants such as Bhinderwalan & Nijjar, making calls to assassinate Constitutional functionaries of the country, calling for a referendum which is nothing but a plebiscite, taken jointly or individually... constitute “sufficient cause” for confirming the decision of the Union of India to extend the declaration of SFJ as unlawful association for a further period of five years,” the tribunal stated while upholding the ban on January 3 this year.","Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) banned as an “unlawful association’ under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

She, the mother, feels happier—much more than when he was born,

When scholars acknowledge his intellect

Indian wives who are pregnant in the US are hurrying to maternity clinics with their husbands, seeking consultations with gynaecologists about pre-term births. Why must the natural rhythm of pregnancy be interrupted with early C-sections? The answer lies in US President Donald Trump ’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, effective Feb 20.I arrived in California on the day Trump was sworn in. The immigrant communities—a tapestry of hopes and dreams—were soon gripped by anxiety as the President signed an executive order altering the very essence of their aspirations. According to the order, children born in the US before Feb 19 would remain American citizens. Those born after would lose the automatic privilege of citizenship by birth .Legal experts argue that the executive order is unconstitutional, and lawsuits challenging its validity are already underway. Amid the legal tussle, the most vulnerable remain the unborn children, caught in the crossfire of politics and parental aspirations.For thousands of Indians working in the US on temporary H-1B and L1 visas, this announcement struck a deeply personal chord. Many are enduring the long wait for green cards, a process that can take 15 years or more. For these families, the birth of a child on American soil had always represented a gateway to stability and security.Doctors shared stories of frantic calls from expectant mothers, some of whom are only seven months into their pregnancies. Studies reveal that from as early as 24 weeks, a foetus can sense maternal stress, a silent dialogue that begins long before birth. Pre-term babies often face challenges like underdeveloped organs, low birth weight, and associated complications. Yet, some parents choose this precarious path to secure the coveted status of US citizenship for their child.Is this an act of love or desperation? An expectant mother I spoke to justified her choice with conviction. “We’re not even green card holders yet,” she explained. “My first child was born here and is a citizen. If I don’t opt for an early C-section, my children might face completely different national identities. I’m doing this for the sake of parity between them.” Her words left me silent, grappling with the weight of her predicament.In the Thirukkural, Valluvar speaks of a mother’s joy. Her happiness may surpass even the ecstasy of childbirth, if her child’s intellect is acknowledged by scholars:Valluvar portrays a mother who celebrates the intellect of her child and the acknowledgement of the same by scholars. Time and situations have placed some parents to find greater happiness in the label of “American citizen” than in the health, intellect, and well-being of their child. What Thiruvalluvar envisioned as the highest joy of motherhood—the acknowledgment of a child’s intellect—has, in some cases, been replaced by the pursuit of a passport.This dilemma reminds me of a story from the Mahabharata. Kadru and Vinata, daughters of Daksha Prajapati, married Rishi Kashyapa. Kadru wished for 1,000 serpent sons; Vinata desired two powerful sons. Kadru’s eggs hatched quickly, but Vinata’s remained dormant. Impatient, she cracked one prematurely, giving birth to Aruna, who was born with underdeveloped limbs. Aruna reproached her lack of patience and cursed her to become a slave to her sister, but he also advised her remission to be given by his sibling who was yet to be born. In time, Garuda was born, a divine bird, who liberated his mother from servitude.Timeless tales resonate in different ways with our lives. A mother’s most distinguished virtue is her patience and penance. Today, these virtues are being tested in unprecedented ways as parents wrestle with the tension between securing a future for their child and honouring the natural course of life.As I reflect on this complex reality, I wish for safe deliveries for all babies, for immigration laws that align with the dreams of parents, and for a world where the joy of parenthood is measured not by geo-political or economic considerations but by the health and happiness of every child.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117793046,imgsize-65476,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/117793046.jpg"

A midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has resulted in the deaths of all 67 people on board both aircraft. The crash, which occurred on Wednesday night over the Potomac River, is now the focus of a major federal investigation.Authorities are working to determine the cause of the deadly incident, with initial reports suggesting possible air traffic control failures and pilot miscommunication. The collision happened in one of the most controlled airspaces in the world, raising concerns about flight safety regulations in and around the nation’s capital.The night before the deadly crash, there was another close call at Reagan National Airport. A separate commercial flight, Republic Airways Flight 4514, was forced to abort its landing due to a helicopter coming too close to its flight path, as per the NYPost. The jet was directed to circle and make another approach, which it did safely.The Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision was potentially flying higher than permitted. According to reports, it was meant to fly at an altitude no higher than 200 feet in the area around the Potomac River. However, flight data suggests the helicopter was flying over 300 feet and was off its intended route when it collided with the American Airlines flight.At the time of the crash, the air traffic controller on duty was handling both helicopter and plane traffic at Reagan National Airport. Due to staffing shortages, the tower was understaffed, with one controller performing the work of two, the Post reported. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had previously reported staffing concerns at the airport, which led to controllers working under high pressure.Radio transmissions from the air traffic control tower captured the moments leading up to the collision. One controller can be heard asking, ""Did you see that?"" as the aircraft collided, followed by a dispatcher confirming, ""Crash, crash, crash.""The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the American Airlines jet. These black boxes will play a crucial role in determining the cause of the crash. Early reports indicate that the jet's approach and communication with air traffic control were routine, but investigators will closely examine all data to uncover the full details of the incident.This collision is not the first time that helicopters and aircraft have come dangerously close near Reagan National Airport. Over the past few years, there have been multiple reports of near-misses involving helicopters and passenger planes attempting to land. In one incident in 2024, a commercial pilot had to take evasive action after receiving a collision warning when a helicopter flew too close.The area surrounding Reagan National is one of the most tightly controlled airspaces in the world, with numerous restrictions due to its proximity to key government buildings, including the White House and the Pentagon. The crash occurred just over three miles south of the White House.The crash occurred as American Eagle Flight 5342, a regional jet, was descending toward Re10.

However, officials have warned that determining the exact cause could take months. Investigators will analyse air traffic control data, pilot decisions, and flight paths before issuing final conclusions.The crash has shocked the nation, with President Donald Trump holding a moment of silence for the victims.

The aircraft collided midair with an Army Black Hawk helicopter. Both aircraft crashed into the icy waters of the Potomac River, and emergency responders have been working to recover the victims' bodies. Tragically, all 67 people aboard, including 60 passengers and four crew members on the jet and three soldiers on the helicopter, perished in the incident.The crash has also sparked political debate, with some figures using the tragedy to address broader issues in the aviation industry. Former President Donald Trump used the incident to criticise diversity and inclusion efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration, suggesting that such policies may have contributed to a decline in standards.Trump specifically blamed the Obama and Biden administrations, claiming their focus on diversity negatively impacted aviation safety.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the crash, which occurred around 9 pm near restricted airspace close to the White House. Authorities have shifted from search-and-rescue to recovery operations.Trump also slammed Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg , calling his leadership a ""disaster"" and stating that under Biden, aviation standards had been lowered.","A midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter has resulted in the deaths of all 67 people on board both aircraft.

Kamala Harris 404 page: What is the truth?



What is Kamala Harris doing now?



Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris . 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed. The viral screenshot also had a statement which looked inspired by Kamala Harris. ""404. This page is unburdened by what has been. You have reached a broken link. Please return to the home page or use the navigation above,"" it was written. Unburdened is a favorite catchphrase of Kamal Harris as she used the word many times. Social media users including Donald Trump Jr claimed that it was done by the 'White House digital team'.Social media fake claims tried to pass the screenshot as of the White House, but the screenshot was from Kamala Harris' own website for her presidential election. One social media user said it was a page for the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign which does not exist now. However, it's not clear whether any section of the site is leading to the 404 page or whether it was led by typing '404' in the URL.All eyes are on the former vice president for her next move as she has not announced anything. According to insiders, she never had a plan B as she was certain that she would win the election and is now thinking about her future moves. This is the first time Harris is not in a public role since 2004. She and her husband Doug Emhoff moved to Los Angeles while Emhoff has also taken up a new job as a partner of the legal firm Wilkie Farr &Gallagher LLP.As far as politics is concerned, Kamala Harris has two options: running for California Governor in 2026 and preparing to run again as the president in 2028. For many, the first option is now below her stature as the former VP and she would be preparing to contest in the presidential election again.","Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris. 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed.

BREAKING: Plane crashes near Philadelphia mall in massive explosion

A medical transport jet carrying a pediatric patient and five others crashed into a residential neighbourhood in Philadelphia on Friday evening, erupting into a fireball that engulfed multiple homes and vehicles in flames. Several videos of the horrific crash have gone viral on social media sending shock waves. The crash occurred just 30 seconds after the Learjet 55 took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, sending shockwaves through the densely populated Rhawnhurst neighbourhood.Mayor Cherelle Parker, speaking at a news conference, said that information on fatalities was not immediately available.However, she confirmed that several homes and vehicles had sustained significant damage. ""This is still an active scene under investigation,"" she said.A horrific video has gone viral from the spot, where a man was seen running out of a huge fire from the crash site.Commenting to the video, a user wrote, ""What the hell is happening? Why are so many planes crashing? Are these all just coincidences?""""This is horrific. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this tragedy,"" another commented.""HORRIFYING. I pray from the depths of my heart that they were able to get immediate treatment and survive this tragedy. What a heartbreaking scene,"" the third one said.A doorbell camera captured the horrifying moment the jet plunged from the sky in a streak of white before exploding upon impact near Roosevelt Mall, a busy shopping centre. The footage shows an enormous fireball followed by thick black smoke billowing into the night sky.""All we heard was a loud roar and didn't know where it was coming from. We just turned around and saw the big plume,"" said Jim Quinn, the homeowner whose doorbell camera recorded the incident.The aircraft vanished from radar at an altitude of 1,600 feet just after taking off at 6.06 pm. It was en route to Springfield, Missouri, and registered to a company operating as Med Jets, according to the flight tracking website Flight Aware.Eyewitnesses described scenes of chaos and destruction. Cell phone footage taken in the aftermath showed debris scattered across the intersection, vehicles burned beyond recognition, and homes severely damaged. Emergency responders rushed to the scene, with police and fire trucks flooding the area and cordoning off a wide perimeter around the crash site.Michael Schiavone, 37, who lives in the nearby Mayfair neighbourhood, said his house shook from the explosion. ""It felt like a mini earthquake. When I checked my security camera, it looked like a missile was coming down. There was a large explosion, so I thought we were under attack for a second,"" he said.The National transportation safety board (NTSB) has taken over the investigation. The Federal aviation administration (FAA) has also confirmed that it is gathering information about the crash. Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro assured residents that all available state resources were being mobilized to assist in the response.This crash comes just two days after another tragic air disaster in the US. On Wednesday night, an American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided midair with an Army helicopter in Washington, DC, killing everyone on board both aircraft.The owner of the crashed Learjet, Jet Rescue, is an air ambulance service provider based in Mexico. The company is known for high-profile medical evacuations, including flying baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz to Boston after he was shot in the Dominican Republic in 2019. A message seeking comment was left with Jet Rescue’s U.S. headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.Authorities are expected to provide further updates as the investigation unfolds.","Crash occurred 30 seconds after Learjet 55 took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.

Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed after a meeting between President Nicolás Maduro and a senior Trump administration official, Richard Grenell, on Friday.Grenell, appointed as an envoy for special missions by US President Donald Trump, shared a photo on social media showing himself with the released Americans aboard an aircraft.“We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens. They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn’t stop thanking him”, Grenell wrote in the shared post.The meeting was part of broader efforts by the Trump administration to secure the release of detained US citizens and address migration issues with Venezuela.Grenell’s visit marked a significant shift, as it came as a surprise to many, with some Venezuelans expecting Trump to continue his “maximum pressure” campaign against Maduro.The focus of the mission, however, was on deporting Venezuelan criminals from the US back to their home country and ensuring the return of detained Americans , as outlined by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The US has been working to deport Venezuelans, particularly members of criminal groups, back to Venezuela.The visit also comes amid heightened tensions in Venezuela, where Maduro was recently sworn in for a third term despite disputed election results. The US does not recognise Maduro’s victory and has expressed concerns over the legitimacy of his government.While Grenell's meeting with Maduro was part of a specific diplomatic effort, some Republicans criticized it, fearing that it could legitimize Maduro’s rule.However, the Trump administration emphasised that the release of the detained Americans was a critical priority.","Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed after a meeting between President Nicolás Maduro and a senior Trump administration official.

US education department reverts to Trump-era campus sexual misconduct rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-education-department-reverts-to-trump-era-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules/articleshow/117809058.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The US department of education announced on Friday that schools and universities must adopt the policies established during President Donald Trump ’s first term, particularly regarding sexual misconduct investigations . These policies, which include live hearings and enhanced protections for accused students, will replace those implemented under the Biden administration .The guidance clarifies that Title IX , the 1972 law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in educational institutions, will be enforced following rules introduced by former education secretary Betsy DeVos . These rules, which govern how schools handle misconduct complaints, have been in effect since 2020 and outline a detailed process for investigating and resolving disputes between students.This shift follows a federal court ruling in Kentucky on January 9, which overturned Biden's Title IX revisions. The judge determined that the Biden administration’s updates, which expanded Title IX to cover sexual orientation and gender identity, overstepped presidential authority and violated free speech rights by compelling schools to honour students’ preferred pronouns.As per the AP, the education department now requires that all ongoing investigations be aligned with the 2020 DeVos rules. This includes the continuation of practices such as live hearings, where students can cross-examine each other with legal representation. The Biden-era guidelines, which eliminated this requirement, had been widely criticised by due process advocates, who argue the old rules ensure fairness for both the accused and the accuser.Tyler Coward, from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), praised the return to the 2020 rules, stating, “The return to the 2020 rules ensures that all students — whether they are the accused or the accuser — will receive fair treatment and important procedural safeguards .”Critics, however, argue that the Trump-era rules, particularly the live hearing requirement, will deter victims of sexual violence from coming forward. Emma Grasso Levine, from Know Your IX , expressed concern that these changes leave many vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ individuals and survivors of assault, without necessary protections.The memo issued by the education department also highlighted the department’s responsibility to enforce these rules, emphasising the role of presidential authority. The rules reduce schools’ liability, holding them accountable only if they act with “deliberate indifference” to the misconduct.","The US department of education announced on Friday that schools and universities must adopt policies established during President Donald Trump ’s first term.

Pentagon to deploy over 1000 additional troops for Trump's immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-to-deploy-over-1000-additional-troops-for-trumps-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/117810101.cms,"The Pentagon is set to deploy at least 1,000 additional active-duty troops as part of US President Donald Trump’s intensified efforts to curb illegal immigration, US officials said on Friday.This includes roughly 500 soldiers, mainly a headquarters unit from the 10Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, who will be sent to the US-Mexico border. Additionally, about 500 Marines will be stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to assist with the detention of migrants.According to officials cited by AP, discussions regarding troop numbers are ongoing, and further deployments may be considered. These actions follow Trump's executive orders, signed shortly after his inauguration on January 20, directing a military-led reinforcement of border security.Last week, the first contingent of 1,600 active-duty personnel was deployed to the southern border. The troops stationed at the border are expected to assist with setting up concertina wire barriers, transportation, intelligence gathering, and logistical support for Border Patrol agents. Meanwhile, those assigned to Guantanamo Bay will work on preparing the facility for an anticipated influx of detainees and performing other support duties.Speaking on ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the US could detain ""thousands of individuals in tents, secured in places at Guantanamo Bay."" He also noted the potential detention of violent criminals and gang members, highlighting the defense department’s plans to prepare high-security detention facilities at Guantanamo for such individuals.Officials have signaled that additional troop deployments could be announced in the coming days, with estimates suggesting the total deployment could reach 10,000. Prior to these moves, approximately 2,500 National Guard and Reserve forces were stationed along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border.The US military is also assisting the department of homeland security in deportation flights for over 5,000 detained migrants, with some expected to be held at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay. On Wednesday, President Trump said that his administration planned to send the “worst criminal aliens” to Guantanamo and ordered the Pentagon to prepare facilities for up to 30,000 detainees.This is not the first time migrants have been detained at Guantanamo Bay. The US has previously housed migrants intercepted at sea, including individuals from Haiti and Cuba, at a facility known as the Migrant Operations Center. However, the current plans represent an unprecedented expansion of the detention policy.","The Pentagon is set to deploy at least 1,000 additional active-duty troops as part of US President Donald Trump’s intensified efforts to curb illegal immigration.

It also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term ""gender"" with ""sex"" on government forms.Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: ""The page you're looking for was not found."" Some pages disappeared and came back intermittently.Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump and said he didn't know anything about it but that he'd endorse such a move.""I don't know. That doesn't sound like a bad idea to me,"" Trump said, adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives.Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's website: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems.Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of America , a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender.

WASHINGTON: The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the Defense Department issued guidance declaring ""identity months dead.""The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as ""discrimination"" and insisted that the country must instead move toward a merit-based society.The White House proclamation calls for ""public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities,"" though there is no elaboration on what constitutes ""appropriate.""A news release from the Defense Department titled ""Identity Months Dead at DOD"" says official resources, including working hours, will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month, Women's History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month were among the events listed as now barred.""We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,"" the Defense Department release read.In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday, hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, despite no evidence of that.Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black history, culture and education.Trump's proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It said their achievements ""have monumentally advanced the tradition of equality under the law in our great country"" and are a continued inspiration.The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great, saying he was among those who have ""pushed the boundaries of excellence in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.""""This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age,"" the proclamation said, ""I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my Administration.""","The White House proclamation calls for ""public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities"" A news release from the Defense Department titled ""Identity Months Dead at DOD"" says official resources will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117809614,imgsize-861458,width-400,resizemode-4/117809614.jpg"

What was the misinformation around Joe Ellis?



Who is Jo Ellis?



'Blackhawk took a bizarre flight path'



After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring policies of the Obama and Biden governments for the tragic mid-air collision between a Blackhawk and an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter, rumors spread that one of the pilots of the helicopter was a transgender person -- Jo Ellis. This was to connect Donald Trump's reasoning with the mishap -- until Jo Ellis issued a video claiming that she is indeed a Blackhawk pilot, but is alive and was not flying the ill-fated helicopter.""Interesting morning. This is Jo Ellis. I am a Blackhawk pilot with the Virginia Army National Guard. I understand some people have associated me with the crash in DC and that is false. It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some kind of political agenda, They don't deserve that. I don't deserve this. And I hope you all know that I am alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors,"" she said adding a statement that the Department of Defense handles casualty notifications and confirmed that no Virginia National Guard personnel were involved in the Black Hawk collision.Jo Ellis' social media posts were scanned after she was mistakenly identified as one of the pilots.

Top priority for Trump

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump sent an envoy Friday to Venezuela to warn leftist leader Nicolas Maduro to accept the unconditional return of deported Venezuelans or face consequences.Richard Grenell, an outspoken ally of Trump who serves in a broad role as envoy for special missions, traveled to Caracas to speak to Maduro as the new administration vows to push a hard line.""President Trump expects Nicolas Maduro to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to the United States, and to do so unequivocally and without condition,"" said Mauricio Claver-Carone, the US special envoy for Latin America.He said that Grenell was also demanding that ""American hostages need to be released immediately, unequivocally.""""All I would do on this call is urge the Maduro government the Maduro regi in Venezuela, to heed to special envoy Ric Grenell and to his demands and what he puts on the table, because ultimately, there will be consequences otherwise,"" Claver-Carone told reporters.Venezuela's communication minister, Freddy Nanez, confirmed on Telegram that Maduro accepted a meeting with Grenell but suggested that the Venezuelan side did not expect agreements.It would be one of the first known meetings by the second Trump administrations with a government it considers hostile since the inauguration.Maduro was recently sworn in for a third term despite widespread international concerns about irregularities in the election.Claver-Carone said that the talks did not imply any softening of position on Maduro.The previous administration of Joe Biden agreed to relax sanctions on oil as part of a deal for American prisoners and free elections.Venezuela freed 10 Americans in a swap. But Biden reimposed sanctions after Maduro did not follow suit on democracy demands.Maduro recently announced the capture of seven ""mercenaries"" and said two were US citizens.""This is not a quid pro quo, is not a negotiation in exchange for anything. President Trump himself has made very clear we don't need Venezuelan oil,"" Claver-Carone said.Trump has made deporting undocumented people in the United States a top priority. During his campaign, he described immigrants as ""poisoning the blood"" of the United States.Since his return, he has pressed countries to take back deportees a top priority for secretary of state Marco Rubio as he starts a five-nation tour of Latin America on Saturday.In his first week back in the White House, Trump vowed crushing tariffs on Colombia, a longstanding US ally, after its president called for more humane treatment of repatriated citizens.The Trump administration quickly ended protections from deportation for more than 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States under protected status.The Biden administration had allowed them to stay due to the fears for their safety if they return to Venezuela.Trump also signed a law making it easier to detain migrants who commit crimes, named after 22-year-old Laken Riley, a nursing student murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan migrant who had been arrested twice but released before her killing.The Venezuelan opposition, whose candidate was identified by both the Trump and Biden administrations as the rightful winner of last year's presidential election , criticized the ending of the protections, saying that the vast majority of the Venezuelans in the United States were ""honest and hard-working"" and forced to flee by Maduro.Grenell, a prolific user of social media, in Trump's first term served as acting director of national intelligence and ambassador to Germany, where he generated controversy with posts in support of Europe's populist right.","Richard Grenell, an outspoken ally of Trump, traveled to Caracas to speak to Maduro.

Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , on Monday challenged in a high court their conviction in the Al-Qadir Trust case . An accountability court in Islamabad convicted the former first couple in the high-profile 190 million British Pounds case in a much-anticipated ruling earlier this month.As already indicated by the party, their lawyers filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the conviction and sentence, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf said in a WhatsApp message.""Legal Team representing Imran Khan & Bushra BiBi, challenges Al-Qadir Trust case decision at IHC,"" the party said, adding that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) ""maliciously misused its authority by announcing sentence, with incomplete investigation"".It further stated that the decision to approach the high court was taken to annul the decision and order acquittal of the former first couple.Judge Nasir Javed Rana of anti-corruption court announced the reserved verdict on January 17, convicting Khan and his wife Bibi guilty of corruption in the case and sentencing them to 14 and seven years respectively in prison.The NAB, the top anti-corruption body, in December 2023 had filed the case against Khan, Bibi and six others, accusing them of causing loss to the tune of Rs 50 billion to the national kitty.However, only the former first couple has been prosecuted as all others, including a property tycoon, were out of the country.The case was based on the charge that an amount of Rs 50 billion (190 million pound), returned to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency as part of a settlement with a property tycoon was misused.The funds were reportedly intended for the national treasury but were allegedly redirected for personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan to set up a university.Bibi, as a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust, was accused of benefiting from this settlement, including acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have been convicted of corruption.

4 Pakistani men sentenced to death for 'online blasphemy' against Quran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/4-pakistani-men-sentenced-to-death-for-online-blasphemy-against-quran/articleshow/117600872.cms,"Representative photo

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.
