The United States early on Sunday launched strikes on three key Iranian nuclear and military facilities, escalating the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.President Donald Trump called the operation “very successful,” confirming that the targets included Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, with Fordow identified as the main focus. Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency also acknowledged that all three sites were hit in the early hours.Early on Sunday, the United States conducted airstrikes on three of Iran’s most vital nuclear facilities, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, signaling the first direct U.S. involvement in Israel’s conflict with Tehran. The attack on Fordow, a deeply buried and heavily fortified site, reportedly included the deployment of six 30,000-pound “bunker buster” bombs, weapons that can only be delivered by the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 stealth bombers.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7.

Regional conflict still looms large





A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.Also read: Iran strikes southern Israel; thick black smoke fills sky as missile hits high-rise apartment In the midst of this turmoil, US President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a large-scale overnight operation in Tehran, targeting “dozens of military industrial sites for missile production” and the Spand nuclear R&D headquarters. According to the IDF, over 60 fighter jets struck around 120 targets using “precise intelligence guidance.”“These sites were built over years and were the industrial centre of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defence,” the IDF said, adding that it also struck a key facility used for producing raw materials for rocket engines.The Spand headquarters, founded in 2011 by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was also hit. The IDF described it as central to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. During the same operation, four Iranian drones were intercepted.President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

Honeymoon Murder Mystery: Meghalaya Police Lying? Raghuvanshi Family Calls for CBI Investigation

A honeymoon that ended in horror

Family alleges conspiracy, demands narco test

Mother's anguish echoes nationwide outrage

NEW DELHI: A local court in Meghalaya on Saturday remanded Sonam Raghuvanshi and her alleged boyfriend Raj Kushwaha to 13 days of judicial custody in the sensational murder case of Indore resident Raja Raghuvanshi, who was killed during his honeymoon in the northeastern state.The pair, along with three of Kushwaha's friends: Vishal Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi, have been arrested in connection. All five accused are now behind bars, with Chauhan, Rajput, and Kurmi already in 14-day judicial custody since Thursday.Raja Raghuvanshi, who hailed from Indore, married Sonam on May 11. The couple left for their honeymoon on May 20. Just three days later, Raja went missing in Meghalaya.His mutilated body was discovered nearly ten days later, on June 2, dumped in a gorge near a waterfall in the scenic Sohra region of East Khasi Hills.Following a state-wide manhunt, Sonam surrendered to police in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, on June 8. Raj Kushwaha and the other three accused were arrested from various locations across Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. A special investigation team (SIT) of the Meghalaya Police is probing the high-profile case, which has gripped national attention.Back in Indore, the victim's family has cast serious doubts on Sonam's version of events and her cooperation with the investigation.""Sonam misled the investigators during her eight-day police custody and withheld key details about the murder,"" said Raja's elder brother, Sachin Raghuvanshi. ""She must be remanded in police custody for a longer period for proper interrogation.""He demanded that all the accused be brought to Indore for a comprehensive probe to uncover the full extent of the alleged conspiracy. Sachin further called for narcoanalysis tests not just for Sonam, but also for her family and friends, suspecting a larger web of involvement.""It is not easy to plan such a massive conspiracy,"" he said. ""The motive behind my brother's murder must be clearly established.""Raja's mother, Uma Raghuvanshi, overwhelmed with grief, questioned Sonam's alleged role in the murder.""Why did Sonam get my son killed?"" she asked. ""She, her friends, and all those close to her must be interrogated. I won't find peace until I hear the answer to this directly from Sonam's mouth.""","Raja Raghuvanshi, who hailed from Indore, married Sonam on May 11. The couple left for their honeymoon on May 20.

Israel hammers Iran: Trump mulls bunker busters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-and-china-ayatollah-khamenei-xi-jinping-donald-trump-israel-iran-war/articleshow/121972248.cms,"AI image for representation only.

From Tehran to Baghdad: Thousands Across Middle East March Against Israel's Attacks On Iran

“China may be offering economic relief and rhetorical support to Iran, but actual military intervention is not anywhere near the table yet,” Wen-Ti Sung, nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Bloomberg.

Why it matters

1. China’s support for Iran is driven more by economic self-interest and strategic restraint than ideological alignment.

2. Beijing’s Middle East strategy is transactional and risk-averse, prioritizing energy security and economic ties over alliances.

Between the lines: Rhetoric without risk

Zoom in

Oil calculus: Over 90% of Iran’s oil exports go to China, mostly via sanction-evading methods using yuan and shadow fleets.

Yet Iran accounts for less than 1% of China’s total trade. It’s significant for Tehran, not Beijing.

“If Iranian oil disappears, China has other options,” noted Fitch Ratings. “OPEC+ spare capacity could fill the gap.” Beijing’s diversified energy strategy is designed precisely for this scenario-an unstable supplier becomes expendable.

Energy risk: If the conflict disrupts the Strait of Hormuz, the fallout for China could be massive. Nearly half of its crude oil passes through the narrow waterway.

Weapon supply: Iran needs advanced air defense and fighter jets to match Israel. But China has not signed a new arms deal with Iran since 2005. US sanctions have disincentivized such transactions.

Public mood: Some Chinese nationalist voices want Beijing to back Iran militarily. But most state messaging focuses on stability, and social media commentary is mixed.

“If Islamic countries such as Pakistan intervene, it will indirectly drag China in, because the weapons they use are from China,” Pan Guang of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences told the South China Morning Post.

The big picture

What they’re saying

“Xi has expressed willingness to help. But what can he or China do?” asked Zhiqun Zhu, professor at Bucknell University. “Mediating is a tall order that’s hard to reach without cooperation of other key players, especially the United States.”

“Further escalation of tensions in the Middle East is not in the interests of any party,” said China’s foreign ministry, urging countries with “special influence on Israel” - a nod to the US - to play a constructive role.

“If Trump takes some action on the Israel-Iran issue, he can divert attention from other troublesome issues,” said Pan Guang, implying that China sees US threats as partly political theater.

What’s next

But don’t expect Beijing to:

Sell weapons to Tehran

Mediate alone between Israel and Iran

The bottom line





As Israel rains missiles on Iranian military and nuclear targets and President Donald Trump weighs direct US intervention with bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei finds himself increasingly isolated. But the one power many hoped - or feared - might come to Tehran’s aid, China, has stayed conspicuously cautious.Not that China has totally abandoned Iran, it has drawn a red line: But only on paper. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi called the Israeli strikes on Iran “unacceptable.” President Xi Jinping issued a condemnation through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China even offered rhetorical support for Iran’s “sovereignty and security.” But beyond the statements, one thing was conspicuously absent: Action.Chinese President Xi Jinping has condemned Israel’s assault, emphasized dialogue, and backed Iran’s sovereignty. Yet he has shown no signs of rushing to deliver weapons, military intelligence, or any other support that might change the battlefield calculus in Iran’s favor.Iran is facing its most serious external threat since the 1979 revolution. Israel has killed over 600 Iranians, including top generals and nuclear scientists. Trump has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” and is weighing military options. And yet, China - a supposed strategic partner - has stuck to statements and sidestepped commitments.The lack of meaningful action from Beijing signals two crucial realities:Beijing’s pattern is clear. As in Ukraine, it prefers moral positioning to material involvement. “China may be offering economic relief and rhetorical support to Iran, but actual military intervention is not anywhere near the table yet,” Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Bloomberg.The calculus is both ideological and pragmatic. Xi’s doctrine of non-interference-rooted in Deng-era realism-has become a trademark of China’s global posture. That principle allows Beijing to project neutrality in foreign conflicts, appeal to the Global South, and avoid the pitfalls of overextension that have ensnared the US for decades.In this case, the risks are exceptionally high. Iran is being directly targeted not just by Israel but potentially by an emboldened United States. President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of using “bunker buster” bombs to strike Iran’s deeply buried nuclear sites. Open conflict with a US-backed adversary in the Middle East is a trap China has no interest in walking into.“China does not want to risk getting entrapped by Iran’s war with an Israel that has the Trump administration behind it,” Sung explained.China and Iran have deepened ties in recent years. Xi oversaw Iran’s entry into BRICS and the SCO. They signed a 25-year strategic deal in 2021, reportedly worth $400 billion in investments. But implementation has been slow, and sanctions have chilled enthusiasm among Chinese firms.Iran is a “strategic partner” for Beijing only insofar as it fits broader geopolitical aims - challenging US dominance, securing oil, and building influence. Iran is not central to China's Middle East blueprint.Meanwhile, China has kept relations warm with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. When Beijing brokered a diplomatic thaw between Tehran and Riyadh in 2023, it celebrated the moment but quickly stepped back as new conflicts erupted.“China’s strategy in the Middle East is to stay on good terms with everyone to maximize its economic gains and geopolitical influence,” Neil Thomas of the Asia Society Policy Institute told the Bloomberg.And if conflict between the US and Iran escalates, Beijing may even benefit. Greater US involvement in the Middle East would “distract Washington from strategic competition with China,” Bloomberg analysts noted.If the conflict deepens and Trump orders US strikes, China will likely double down on diplomacy, perhaps via the UN Security Council, where it can flex soft power without real costs.Deploy military assetsThat’s not how Xi operates. China has neither the appetite nor the leverage to act as a wartime ally. And with global oil prices, Chinese economic recovery, and domestic woes in play - including youth unemployment and a real estate slump - the risks of deeper entanglement far outweigh the potential gains.Xi Jinping is not coming to the Ayatollah’s rescue. China may speak out against Israeli strikes and back Iran in the abstract. But when it comes to real power - arms, troops, strategic shielding - Tehran is on its own.Xi’s priority remains crystal clear: avoid chaos, avoid sanctions, and avoid war.(With inputs from agencies)","Beijing’s Middle East strategy is transactional and risk-averse, prioritizing energy security and economic ties over alliances.

"Israel-Iran war: US moves B-2 bombers to Guam, one aircraft can carry 30000-pound bunker-buster bombs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-war-us-moves-b-2-bombers-to-guam-one-aircraft-can-carry-30000-pound-bunker-buster-bombs/articleshow/121996556.cms,"Several B2 bombers reportedly moved to Guam amid Israel-Iran war.

What is a B-2 bomber?



Will Trump deploy bunker buster bombs if the US decides to join the strike?







Several US Air Force B-2 bombers reportedly have taken off from a base in the United States and moved toward the Pacific island of Guam while President Donald Trump has taken two weeks' time to decide whether the US should take part in Israel's strikes against Iran. Flight tracker data showed the B-2 aircraft, which can carry the 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs Trump is considering deploying against Iran's underground nuclear facilities in Fordo, taking off from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.The B-2 Spirit is a long-range, stealth strategic bomber developed by Northrop Grumman for the United States Air Force. Introduced in 1997, it features a distinctive flying wing design and radar-absorbing materials that allow it to evade detection and penetrate heavily defended enemy airspace. Capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, the B-2 can deliver up to 40,000 pounds of ordnance and fly more than 6,000 nautical miles without refueling. Operated by a two-person crew, it plays a vital role in U.S. military strategy and nuclear deterrence. With only 21 ever built and a unit cost exceeding $2 billion, it is one of the most advanced and expensive aircraft in the world.According to reports, Trump suggested to defense officials that it would only make sense for the US to launch strikes against Iran if the bunker buster bomb was guaranteed to destroy the Fordown facility embedded in the mountains.The Guardian reported that Trump was told that dropping the GBU-57s, a 13.6-tonne (30,000lb) bomb would effectively eliminate Fordow but he does not appear to be fully convinced, the people said, and has held off authorizing strikes as he also awaits the possibility that the threat of US involvement would lead Iran to talks.Earlier Saturday, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against missile sites and a nuclear facility in Iran and claimed its strikes had killed three commanders of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, the most powerful military force in the country.","Several US Air Force B-2 bombers reportedly have taken off from a base in the United States and moved toward the Pacific island of Guam.

Ayatollah era coming to end? Iran's Khamenei names successors; son's name missing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/irans-supreme-era-coming-to-end-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-names-successors-sons-name-missing/articleshow/121993647.cms,"Iran Vows Revenge After 'Foiling' Huge Israeli Attack On Isfahan Nuclear Site | 'Unforgivable Crime'

Move to end dynastic succession?



US, Israel signal Khamenei not untouchable







Staring at an uncertain future, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has reportedly named three senior clerics as potential successors marking an unprecedented move since the Iran-Israel war began, suggesting that he is preparing for the end of his more than three-decade rule.According to a New York Times report, Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, who is also a cleric, has not been named in the list of successors. Iran’s former hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, was once seen as a leading contender to succeed Ayatollah Khamenei, but his prospects ended with his death in a helicopter crash in 2024.Moreover, the report, citing Iranian officials, said that Khamenei has retreated to a secure underground bunker, suspending all electronic communications and relying solely on a trusted aide to relay messages to military commanders. These emergency protocols reflect a deep concern over assassination threats, particularly following the deaths of several high-ranking IRGC officials in recent Israeli attacks.Long viewed as a shadowy figure with considerable influence behind the scenes, and often speculated to be groomed for leadership, Mojtaba’s omission signals a deliberate move to reject dynastic succession.This may be an attempt to preserve the Islamic Republic’s legitimacy by upholding its religious and institutional foundations rather than allowing power to pass within a family line.By naming successors and reshuffling key positions within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Khamenei appears to be laying the groundwork for continuity in case of further instability or even his own sudden demise.It is a rare acknowledgment of the fragility now surrounding Iran’s top leadership, as the country grapples with both external military threats and internal questions about its political future.Khamenei's apprehensions aren't delusional. US and Israel have, at several moments in the past week, made it clear that the two would consider targeting the Supreme Leader.Even though the United States has not officially entered the Iran-Israel crisis, Donald Trump has made his contempt towards Khamenei crystal clear after he issued a stark warning to the Supreme Leader saying that the States wouldn't ""kill"" him, ""at least not for now"".""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" he had said earlier this week. Trump has also demanded an unconditional surrender.This was followed by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's warning that the nation wasn't ruling out targeting Khamenei. Speaking to ABC news, when asked if Israel would target the Supreme Leader, Netanyahu said ""doing what we need to do.""Meanwhile, Khamenei has not directly responded to these threats, but has made it clear that Iran would not ""submit to anyone's attacks"".","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has reportedly named three senior clerics as potential successors.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, from immigration detention after spending more than three months in custody.Khalil was detained in early March as the Trump administration sought to deport him over his alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on campus.The decision was announced by US District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey, following a request from Khalil's legal team to grant him bail or relocate him from Louisiana to New Jersey to be near his wife and newborn child, according to the Associated Press.Khalil's arrest marked the first under Trump's initiative against students involved in campus protests regarding Israel's military actions in Gaza. His prominent role in Columbia's pro-Palestinian demonstrations last year led to protests in New York and Washington, DC.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has advocated for Khalil's expulsion, saying Khalil’s activism poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”Judge Farbiarz had previously ruled that the government could not continue detaining Mahmoud Khalil based on his role in pro-Palestinian protests.However, officials later argued that Khalil, a legal US resident, was being held for allegedly providing false information on his green card application — a claim Khalil firmly denies.Khalil was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan apartment in connection with his participation in the campus demonstrations.Khalil says he did nothing wrong and did not hide anything on his green card application. He told the court he only did a university-approved internship with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and was not an officer, as the government claims.Khalil was not arrested during the Columbia protests and has not been accused of any crimes. His public presence at the demonstrations drew attention from critics and the White House, which accused him of “siding with terrorists” without providing evidence.","US District Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, from immigration detention.

Netanyahu applauds Trump’s bold move







Iran condemned the US strikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities early Sunday, calling it a “savage assault” and declared it will “never” halt its nuclear program.The United States had conducted targeted airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities—Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. US president Donald Trump confirmed that B-2 stealth bombers were used in the operation and that a full payload was dropped on Fordow, the primary target.The atomic energy organisation of Iran, which manages the country’s nuclear operations, said the facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan were subjected to a “savage assault” as reported by the state-affiliated IRNA news agency.The agency called the attacks a “blatant violation of international law,” specifically citing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and accused the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the international atomic energy agency (IAEA), of being “complicit.”Mehdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Parliament speaker Mohammad Ghalibaf, said the Fordow facility had already been evacuated in anticipation of a strike. “The site had been evacuated a long time ago and the damages are not irreversible,” he said, adding, “you cannot bomb knowledge.”According to the White House, Trump had earlier given Iran a two-week deadline to respond to US conditions, but the strikes were launched ahead of schedule.In a televised national address after the attack, Trump called the strikes “a spectacular military success” aimed at neutralizing Iran’s nuclear threat. “Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” he said.“If they do not, future attacks would be far greater and easier.” He also expressed gratitude to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling their cooperation “unmatched.” “We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before,” Trump said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump’s decision, calling the strikes a “pivot of history.” In a video message on Sunday, Netanyahu said, ""Congratulations President Trump.

The White House shared images of the Situation Room during this weekend's US strike on Iran, marking the country's direct entry into the war in support of Israel.In the pictures shared on X, senior officials from the Trump administration can be seen, including secretary of state Marco Rubio , vice president JD Vance, and defence secretary Pete Hegseth.The United States officially entered the Israel-Iran conflict by launching airstrikes on three of Iran’s key nuclear facilities. American B-2 stealth bombers targeted Fordow, Natanz, and a third site near Isfahan in an overnight operation that US President Donald Trump confirmed in a national address from the White House. He said the goal was to destroy Iran’s uranium enrichment capacity and halt what he described as a nuclear threat from the “world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terror.” Trump warned that future attacks would be “far greater and a lot easier” if Iran refused to make peace and return to diplomatic talks.Iran confirmed that the three sites were hit, with officials stating the bombings occurred around 2:30 am local time on Sunday. Trump claimed the sites were “completely and totally obliterated,” but Iranian sources provided limited details. A local official from Qom, near Fordow, told Iran’s Tasnim news agency that parts of the Fordow nuclear facility had been bombed.Iran has so far avoided directly attacking US forces in the region, but its leaders have repeatedly warned that any American involvement in the war would trigger retaliation.The strikes mark a significant shift in Trump’s foreign policy. Despite pledging to avoid foreign conflicts, Trump authorised the attacks after days of mixed signals. US and Israeli officials said the goal was to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb by targeting its most secure and fortified nuclear sites. The airstrikes come after more than a week of fighting between Israel and Iran, which began on June 13 when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iranian infrastructure and military targets. Iran responded with missile strikes and showed interest in returning to nuclear talks, but the situation has now escalated.Following the US involvement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump for denying Iran access to nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the US State Department has started evacuating Americans from Israel, with Ambassador Mike Huckabee urging citizens in Israel and the West Bank to request evacuation via cruise ships, commercial airlines, or government-operated flights.Trump described the mission as “historic” in his posts online and urged Iran to “end this war.” However, it's still unclear whether the US plans more attacks or sees this as the end of its involvement.

Shots at Democrats: JD Vance calls Alex Padilla 'Jose Padilla' after press clash; blames Gavin Newsom for LA unrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shots-at-democrats-jd-vance-calls-alex-padilla-jose-padilla-after-press-clash-blames-gavin-newsom-for-la-unrest/articleshow/121985674.cms,"JD Vance

Vance’s ‘Jose’ Jibe BLOWS UP; Karen Bass Calls Out ‘Blatant Disrespect’





US vice president JD Vance sparked outrage on Friday during a tense visit to Los Angeles, where he accused California governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests and mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” a name associated with a convicted al-Qaida plotter.Vance’s visit came after days of violent clashes between police and protesters, following federal immigration raids across Southern California. The Trump administration’s decision to send in 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines has been heavily criticised by state and local leaders, who accuse the White House of escalating tensions rather than calming them.Speaking to reporters after touring a federal Joint Operations Center and mobile command centre, Vance doubled down on blaming California officials. “Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass, by treating the city as a sanctuary city, have basically said that this is open season on federal law enforcement,” he said.“What happened here was a tragedy,” Vance continued. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job. That is disgraceful. And it is why the president has responded so forcefully.”Vance also referred to Democratic Senator Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” a week after the senator was tackled and handcuffed while speaking at a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem . “I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,” Vance said. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theatre. And that's all it is.”Critics were quick to call out the remark, noting that “Jose Padilla” is the name of a man convicted of terrorism-related charges during the Bush administration. Governor Newsom responded on X, saying the name mix-up was “no accident.”Governor Newsom fired back during a press conference, accusing Vance of spreading “utter nonsense.” He denied claims that state officials encouraged violence, saying, “The Vice President's claim is categorically false. The governor has consistently condemned violence and has made his stance clear.”Mayor Karen Bass also condemned the comment. “How dare you say that city officials encourage violence? We kept the peace,” she said, calling the federal operation a “stunt” that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars.Earlier that day, Newsom had urged Vance to meet with victims of January’s deadly wildfires while in California and to speak with US President Donald Trump about unlocking $40 billion in federal wildfire aid. “I hope we get that back on track,” Newsom posted on X. “We are counting on you, Mr Vice President.” Vance did not respond to those remarks during his Friday appearance.","US vice president JD Vance sparked outrage on Friday during a tense visit to Los Angeles.

Arslan Akhtar, a visa specialist working with the State Department, did not know that he was being recorded on a hidden camera when he took pride in saying that he coaches potential illegal aliens, offers them tips on how to avoid deportation. He also called his Jewish co-workers ""garbage people"" and opined that Elon Musk should be lynched -- speaking to journalist James O'Keefe, who was undercover. The discussion took place inside what looked like a restaurant.The State Department took immediate action and fired Akhtar as the clips for the interview went viral, with social media users asking why a person named Arslan Akhtar got a job in the State Department. The Washington Times confirmed that the department fired Akhtar ""upholding the rule of law"" as protecting the integrity of the immigration system is essential. The department will also launch a new contractor screening and vetting process, the department said.In the viral video, Akhtar said he gave advice to Hispanic people on avoiding deportation and his first advice is to ""keep your mouth shut"".“Sometimes, I do say it to cab drivers that are from, like, Hispanic descent. I’m like, ‘Don’t talk to the police,’” Akhtar said in the video. “I’m just saying, like, don’t admit the truth.That is the ultimate loophole. Always maintain your innocence.”“Don’t give them more information. Don’t tell them what you did, because you think being honest will help your case. It does not. Exact opposite. In fact, that’s all we’re looking for,"" he said.Akhtar said the State Department is full of Jewish people, ""terrible Jewish people"", 'like, really garbage people"".“These people are, like, colonists. These people are promoting genocide. These are real awful folks. And you know what the problem is? It’s a cultural issue with these guys.” From his experience of working with Jewish organizations he said all of these people (Jews) are awful and they don't want change. On Israelis, he said he hates them to death and Yemenis are the most conniving group of folks next to Indians.“Mexican people are nice. They never try to lie for no reason, like Bangladeshi people do,” he said.“It’s a culture of hatred, ultimately, and it’s a culture of dominance,” Akhtar said on White people. “They feel like they have the right to dominate everybody. To claim Greenland, to claim Canada, to claim Israel, Palestine.”In a post on X, the State Department said his dismissal was “just the beginning.”“These radicals with anti-American views have been embedded in our executive branch for generations and we are systematically cleaning out contractors that have allowed this,” said the Friday post. “Let us be clear: If you have these views and you work in or with the State Department, we will find you.”On Elon Musk, Akhtar said, “I would love for him to be dragged out of the building with his hair plugs” and be “lynched on the street.”","Arslan Akhtar, a visa specialist working with the State Department, did not know that he was being recorded on a hidden camera.

The United States formally entered the Israel-Iran conflict, as it bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran early Sunday morning local time.US President Donald Trump, who earlier gave himself a 2-week window to decide on whether to strike Iran or not, announced the air strikes in a post on his Truth Social platform.""We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan.

It is capable of entering sophisticated air defenses and conducting precision strikes against hardened targets such as underground nuclear research facilities, like the ones in Iran.The B-2 is the most expensive military aircraft ever built, as each unit costs about $2.1 billion. It has a range of over 6,000 nautical miles without refuelling, enabling strike capabilities from US continental bases. On the other hand, with aerial refuelling, it can reach virtually any target worldwide.A 2-pilot aircraft, the B-2 has a payload capacity of more than 40,000 pounds, and can thus carry a diverse array of both conventional and nuclear weapons. It is also equipped with large ordnance loads, which could include two GBU-57A/B MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), and a 30,000-pound precision-guided ""bunker buster"" bomb.The MOP is the largest conventional bomb in the US arsenal, specifically engineered to defeat hardened underground bunkers.Read |' The bully must now make peace': What Donald Trump said after Iran strike; top quotes","US President Donald Trump announced the air strikes in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights advocate and Columbia University graduate, was released after spending over three months in US immigration detention, reuniting with his wife and infant son.The 30-year-old legal US resident walked free from a Louisiana facility on Friday evening after a federal judge ruled his detention unconstitutional.Khalil landed at Newark Airport in New Jersey on Saturday. He was met by cheering supporters and walked out with his wife, Noor Abdalla, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Khalil was seen pushing his baby son, Deen, in a stroller, raising his fist with a Palestinian keffiyeh over his shoulders.Khalil, who faced no criminal charges, was among the most well-known pro-Palestinian students targeted by the Trump administration during campus protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. ICE agents in plain clothes arrested him in March in front of his pregnant wife.“If they threaten me with detention, even if they would kill me, I would still speak up for Palestine,” Khalil said during a press conference at the airport.“I just want to go back and continue the work I was already doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated rather than punished.”His release followed a ruling from federal judge Michael Farbiarz in Newark, who said the government had failed to prove Khalil posed a flight risk or a danger. “[He] is not a danger to the community,” Farbiarz had said. “Period, full stop.”The judge further concluded that detaining someone over a civil immigration matter amounted to unconstitutional punishment. The Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal, according to NBC.Khalil’s release came after mounting public pressure and legal efforts, with support from multiple Jewish students and faculty at Columbia University. Khalil was previously seen as a bridge-builder, acting as a lead negotiator in 2024 between Jewish and pro-Palestinian student groups during the campus protests.During a past CNN appearance, he said: “The liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other.”Khalil had missed the birth of his son, his graduation, and both Mother’s Day and Father’s Day while in custody. He had only briefly been allowed to see his newborn once earlier in June.“This is not over, and we will have to continue to support this case,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “The persecution based on political speech is wrong, and it is a violation of all of our First Amendment rights, not just Mahmoud’s.”Upon his release, Khalil said outside the Jena facility, “Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this. That doesn’t mean there is a right person for this. There is no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.”“No one is illegal – no human is illegal,” he added. “Justice will prevail no matter what this administration may try.”As part of the release conditions, Khalil had to surrender his passport and green card and must stay within specific states including New York, Michigan, and Louisiana, notifying authorities of his address within 48 hours, reports the Independent.On Sunday evening, a rally celebrating his release and demanding freedom for other detained immigrants and Palestinians will be held at the Cathedral of St John the Divine in Manhattan.","Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights advocate and Columbia University graduate, was released after spending over three months in US immigration detention.

For the past few years, it has become very clear to me, and also many others, that the Democratic Party has become one of corrupt and radical political ideology and positions that simply do not reflect the values of Fort Bend County families, small businesses and hardworking residents of Fort Bend County,” George said as he announced his decision. “I have always believed in the foundational American principles of faith, family and freedom, And I realize that the Republican Party champions these values,” George said.Judge George is facing an indictment on a misdemeanor offense and has consistently maintained his innocence, calling the charges against him a “political witch hunt.” The Democrats have demanded he resign.In his press conference, George said prosecutors offered to drop the felony charges if he agreed to resign.The Fort Bend County District Attorney's office denied the claim.The Republican Party said in a statement that the charges against KP George are rooted in documented allegations of unethical and possibly criminal behavior.

'Khamenei has not authorized...': What Tulsi Gabbard said in March about Iran's nuclear program,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/khamenei-has-not-authorized-what-tulsi-gabbard-said-in-march-about-irans-nuclear-program/articleshow/121995676.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard comes under fire for changing her statement on Iran.

Tulsi Gabbard Posts Testimony Clip On Iran After Trump Rebukes Her Statement On Nuclear Weapons

Did Tulsi Gabbard say the same thing in the testimony?

Mideast ‘BLOWS UP’: 20+ Arab Nations Declare Stand For Iran, Blast Israel’s Strikes





Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has now blamed the media for taking her March statement out of context as President Donald Trump now publicly rebuked her for not alerting the administration enough about Iran's nuclear capabilities. On the first occasion, the president said he did not care what Gabbard said in March and in another statement, he said Gabbard was wrong.Tulsi Gabbard made a complete U-turn amid her position being threatened over the Iran-Israel war, saying the ""dishonest media"" intentionally took her testimony out of context and spread fake news to manufacture division. Gabbard said America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.Tulsi Gabbard testified at a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing for the annual threat assessment of the US Intelligence Community (IC). She said the IC sees China, Russia, Iran and North Korea engaging I activities that could challenge US capabilities and interests.On Iran, she said that the country is seeking to expand its influence in the Middle East, despite the ""degradation of its proxies and defenses during the Gaza conflict"".""Iran has developed and maintains ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs, including systems capable of striking U.S. targets and allies in the region. They've shown a willingness to use these weapons, including during a 2020 attack on US forces in Iraq and in attacks against Israel in April and October 2024. Iran's cyber operations and capabilities also present a serious threat to US networks and data.""Then Tulsi Gabbard categorically went on to say that the IOC continues to assess that Iran is ""not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003"".""We continue to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program. In the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus. Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons. Iran will likely continue efforts to counter Israel and press for U.S. military withdrawal from the region by aiding, arming, and helping to reconstitute its loose consortium of like-minded terrorists, actors, which it refers to as its “Axis of Resistance.” Although weakened, this collection of actors still presents a wide range of threats including to Israel's population, U.S. forces deployed in Iraq and Syria, as well as U.S. and international military and commercial shipping and transit,"" Gabbard said.","Tulsi Gabbard said America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.

Mahmoud Khalil released on bail after more than three months in detention







The Department of Homeland Security condemned the decision of district judge to release Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil and said only an immigration judge has the authority to decide if Khalil should be released or detained.""It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property. An immigration judge has already vindicated this position. We expect a higher court to do the same,"" the DHS said in a statement.""On the same day an immigration judge denied Khalil bond and ordered him removed, one rogue district judge ordered him released. This is yet another example of how out of control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security. Their conduct not only denies the result of the 2024 election, it also does great harm to our constitutional system by undermining public confidence in the courts,"" the statement added.Michael Farbiarz of New Jersey, in his verdict, said Khalil is a lawful permanent resident and was neither a flight risk nor dangerous. His prolonged detention since March was potentially punitive.Speaking to journalists before heading to New York from Louisiana, where he was held, he said he was most eager to see his wife and his son, who was born during his 104 days in detention.""The only time I spent [with] my son was a specified one-hour limit that the government had imposed on us,"" he said.""So that means that now I can actually hug him and Noor, my wife, without looking at the clock.""He also criticised the Trump administration for targeting him for protesting against Israel's military actions in Gaza: ""There's no right person that should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.""White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Mr Khalil of engaging in ""fraud and misrepresentation"" and ""conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests"". ""We expect to be vindicated on appeal, and look forward to removing Khalil from the United States,"" Jackson said.","Mahmoud Khalil released on bail after more than three months in detention.

Pakistan to nominate Trump for Peace Nobel over 'intervention' with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-nominate-trump-for-peace-nobel-over-intervention-with-india/articleshow/121998570.cms,"US President Donald Trump





ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan govt says it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.
