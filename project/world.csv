THANE: The arrest of Shariful Fakir was the result of a joint operation by Mumbai Police and Kasarvadavali police of Thane City. It came after a combing operation near Hiranandani Estate that deployed 150 cops, including several senior officers.The operation began around 9pm on Saturday and concluded with the suspect’s arrest well into the early hours of Sunday.Intelligence units tracked the suspect’s mobile tower location to the creek shore near Waghbil village. The search focused on marshy terrain behind a labour colony near a Metro casting yard, with teams using private and official vehicles to block potential escape routes. “The accused was discovered hiding in extremely challenging conditions, concealed under grass and dried leaves in pitch darkness,” said an officer.The investigation revealed that Shariful chose his hiding spot based on prior knowledge of the area. Multiple teams conducted thorough searches of the labour colony. Security personnel established a cordon while search teams methodically checked every possible hiding spot. Workers at the labour camp were lined up for identification, and their mobile devices were examined for any communication with the suspect.The final phase of the operation unfolded in a narrow lane adjacent to the labour camp, where dense vegetation and mangroves provided numerous potential hiding spots. Local resident Prathamesh Patil, a fisherman whose assistance was sought during the operation, reported: “Police knocked on my door three times throughout the night, showing photographs and seeking information about suspicious movements in the area.”When discovered, the accused was found exhausted, having covered himself with dry leaves. He offered no resistance during the arrest and was immediately transported to Mumbai for detailed interrogation regarding the attack on the actor.A local woman from the labour colony later revealed that the accused was previously involved in an altercation after allegedly misbehaving with her. Other workers confirmed seeing him occasionally at the camp, while security guards reported observing flashlights.","The arrest of Shariful Fakir was the result of a joint operation by Mumbai Police and Kasarvadavali police of Thane City.

PRAYAGRAJ: Engineer Abhey Singh , popularly known online as "" IITian Baba ,"" was expelled from Juna Akhara on Saturday night. The expulsion followed allegations of abusive language directed at his Guru , Mahant Someshwar Puri .As a result, Singh has been banned from entering the Akhara camp and its surroundings. The Akhara emphasised that discipline and devotion to one’s Guru are core principles of Sanyas, and anyone who fails to uphold them cannot be considered a Sanyasi.“The act of Abhey Singh goes against the Guru-Shishya (master-disciple) tradition and the principles of Sanyas. Disrespecting one’s Guru shows a lack of respect for Sanatan Dharma and the Akhara. Discipline is of utmost importance in Juna Akhara, and no one is above it—not me, nor anyone like Singh,” said Mahant Hari Giri, Chief Patron of Juna Akhara.He further stated that every member of the Akhara must abide by strict discipline. Singh, however, violated these rules by using offensive language against his Guru. “Not only the Guru, but no one is allowed to speak against a fellow seer. Based on this violation, the Akhara’s disciplinary committee recommended his expulsion,” Giri added.The chief patron clarified that Abhey Singh will remain barred from the Akhara until he learns to respect his Guru and adhere to its discipline.Abhey Singh, who was a disciple of Mahant Someshwar Puri of Juna Akhara, left his career in aerospace engineering after graduating from IIT-Bombay to become a saint.He gained significant fame at the fair this year, particularly after a viral interview with a news channel turned him into an overnight celebrity. His story was widely covered by leading newspapers and TV channels.With over one lakh followers on Instagram, Singh gained attention for his controversial reel, where he referred to his father as ""Hiranyakashyap"" and his Guru as ""Pagal"" (mad) after a disagreement between them. This sparked widespread demands for action against him within the Akhara, ultimately leading to his expulsion on Saturday night.Previously, Singh’s Guru had expelled him from the camp, but Singh refused to leave the fair and instead sought refuge in the camp of another saint.","Engineer Abhey Singh, popularly known online as ""IITian Baba,"" was expelled from Juna Akhara on Saturday night.

Court grants 5-day remand; lawyer says proper investigation not done

NEW DELHI: Nearly three days after Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed at his Bandra residence in the early hours of Thursday, the Mumbai Police have arrested the alleged main attacker, Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad , a Bangladeshi national. Following two misidentifications and extensive investigations, police confirmed on Sunday that Shehzad, who had entered India illegally, was using multiple aliases. It was revealed that he had entered Saif Ali Khan's house with the intension of theft during which the stabbing occurred.The attack, which left Khan with severe stab wounds to his thoracic spine, unfolded when the intruder confronted a staff member inside the actor's apartment. Khan reportedly intervened, leading to a violent altercation. Following the incident, the actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to remove a 2.5-inch blade. While Khan is now ""out of danger"" and recovering in a regular hospital room, his condition continues to be closely monitored.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mumbai Police questioned two individuals in separate locations — one in Chhattisgarh and another in Mumbai — but both were later cleared of involvement. The breakthrough came when Shehzad was apprehended in Thane, allegedly while planning to flee to his native Bangladesh, news agency ANI reported.A case has been registered against Shehzad under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including charges for grievous assault and housebreaking, as well as provisions of the Passport Act for his illegal entry into India . During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone 9, Dixit Gedam revealed that Shehzad had been using aliases such as Vijay Das and Bijoy Das, and had worked in Mumbai for the past five to six months in various housekeeping jobs.After his arrest, a Mumbai court granted a 5-day police remand in connection with the attack case. After the hearing, Shehzad’s advocate, Sandeep Shekhane said that the police’s statement — that Shehzad had entered India six months ago — was incorrect, asserting that he had been residing in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. Shekhane also cited a violation of section 43A, claiming a lack of proper investigation into the case.""A police custody for 5 days has been granted. The court has asked the police to submit a report within 5 days. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement.""""He has been living here for more than 7 years. His family is in Mumbai... This is a clear-cut violation of 43A.

PRAYAGRAJ: A cluster of 40 huts and six tents at the Maha Kumbh site was gutted in a fire triggered by successive LPG cylinder explosions in Sector 19 on Sunday afternoon, coinciding with CM Yogi Adityanath's visit to Sangam to take stock of preparations for Mauni Amavasya. No casualties or injuries to pilgrims were reported as fire safety teams swiftly evacuated the approximately 25 people inside camps in the vicinity, officials said.PM Modi called Adityanath later to enquire about the fire, originating from a gas leak in the kitchen of the Gita Press camp at 4.08pm. The blaze was controlled within an hour and the area was declared safe by 7pm. NDRF, SDRF and police teams were part of the operation long with 45 fire engines and over 200 fire services personnel, deputy director of fire services Aman Sharma told TOI.Witnesses said they heard at least three cylinder blasts before flames engulfed the tents. Chief fire officer (Prayagraj) RK Pandey said the thatched roofs of some tents fuelled the flames. “The situation is normal now, and losses are being assessed,” additional DGP Bhanu Bhaskar said.The area assigned to Gita Press, which publishes religious texts, and some adjacent stalls suffered the most damage. Some Maha Kumbh participants said they lost an unspecified amount of cash in the blaze. “The fire department received information about the Gita Press camp being engulfed in flames around 4.08pm, and we moved four fire engines immediately,” Sharma said. “There was an alert from the fire watchtower at Jhunsi, too, after our personnel noticed smoke billowing out of tents in Sector 19.”As thick clouds of smoke enveloped the area where most of the akharas had set up camps, there was panic as people ran to safety. The arrival of fire engines and senior police officials pacified the mela participants. “I was inside the akhara when I heard a loud sound and saw everybody running. As I rushed outside, there were two more blasts within minutes,” a sadhu said.A post on Maha Kumbh 2025’s official X handle said, “Very sad! The fire incident at #MahaKumbh has shocked everyone.

MUMBAI: The sheer randomness of the attack on the Saif Ali Khan household was underscored by the suspect ’s alleged confession to police that he had tried to break into another flat in the same building before he entered the actor’s house on the 11th floor. Khan occupies four floors at the top of the 13-storey Sadguru Sharan building. The attempted break-in at the other flat proved unsuccessful, which then prompted him to enter Khan’s house through the duct.The out-of-work Shariful had done a recce on Dec 31, 2024, departing from the Worli-Koliwada staff room where he was temporarily staying for a New Year’s night walk. He arrived at Bandra station and hired an autorickshaw to explore areas in Bandra and Khar until the following morning. “He even inquired with the rickshaw driver, whom he hired, to take him to the locality that houses businessmen and celebrities. After studying the topography, he planned to strike on Jan 15 night,” said police.At midnight on Jan 16, Shariful arrived at Bandra station and chose to walk rather than use public transport, he told police. He walked for almost two hours starting from Bandra to Khar and finally reached Satguru Sharan where Khan lives with his actress-wife Kareena Kapoor Khan and family. Shariful walked through several bylanes in Khar to avoid being captured on CCTV cameras and finally reached the actor’s 13-storey building. He told cops he found it plush enough and decided to strike.He entered the building after jumping over a four-feet wall of the adjacent building premises. The watchman at Satguru Sharan was snoozing. He used a ladder lying in the building premises to climb 12 feet to reach a duct from where he climbed using the pipeline. Since the duct was covered with a pigeon mesh on the fourth floor, he got out of it and entered the fire escape stairwell and climbed up to the 10th floor. This was when his image was captured (face covered with a scarf) in the only CCTV camera on the sixth floor. On the 10th floor, he again entered the duct to climb into the actor’s flat from the bathroom window,” said a police officer.Investigations showed that after fleeing the actor’s 11th floor apartment in Satguru Sharan building at 2.30 am on Jan 16, he jumped 12 feet from the first-floor level to the ground floor to escape. By then, there was a commotion in the actor’s household. The intruder who was spotted by a maid outside the actor’s son’s bedroom had raised an alarm, which led to a confrontation and a fight with Khan and his domestic staff. They had attempted to lock up the intruder in a room but failed to secure the door. After the family rushed downstairs to seek help, the intruder had fled. “The victims thought they had locked the door but it was the intruder who seems to have locked it from inside before he escaped from the fire escape stairwell which was captured in the CCTV,” said the police.","The out-of-work Shariful had done a recce on Dec 31, 2024, departing from the Worli-Koliwada staff room where he was temporarily staying for a New Year’s night walk. He arrived at Bandra station and chose to walk rather than use public transport. He walked for almost two hours starting from Bandra to Khar and finally reached Satguru Sharan where Khan lives.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117381863,imgsize-40406,width-400,resizemode-4/117381863.jpg"

Actor Saif Ali Khan ’s doctors on Sunday said he would need a long period of bed rest. “He is doing well, and prior to discharge, we need to plan his home care because he will have to remain on prolonged bed rest,” Dr Nitin Dange, the neurosurgeon who performed the operation to remove the knife lodged in the actor’s thoracic spine at Lilavati Hospital , said.

A police team scanning CCTV footage looked at visuals from nearly 500 cameras to track the accused in the Saif Ali Khan case. One of the clearest markers in identifying the suspect across locations was the colour and pattern of his shoes. A team led by deputy commissioner of police Dikshit Gedam went through footage from cameras starting from the actor’s building, going towards Linking Road and Bandra station , then Dadar and Worli before tracking him to Thane. Other members of the team included assistant commissioner Adikrao Pol, senior inspector Sanjay Marathe, inspectors Ajay Lingnurkar and Sachin Rane, assistant inspectors Vijay Acharaker, Bajrang Jagtap, Tushar Sawant, and staff.After escaping from the actor’s flat, Shariful loitered around in the Bandra and Khar locality for almost five-and-a-half hours before catching a train from Bandra station to Dadar. By then, he had had a haircut, had a bath, and changed his clothes. “When we started scanning through the CCTV we found the accused near Sadhu Vaswani Petrol pump in Bandra (West) on Linking road where he was found to have changed his shirt. As he knew, there was CCTV footage ahead, he crossed the road. But he was captured in the CCTV of a Khar hotel. After walking for almost a hour and a half, he slept at Khar station at 4 am before returning to Bandra in the morning and taking a train at 8 am to Dadar,” said police.“We kept watching the leg and the shoe for three hours and finally found the person on the CCTV near National College in Khar. It resembled the CCTV image captured at the actor’s building. Then we found him at Bandra railway station and then outside Dadar where he purchased some mobile accessories before he boarded a bus to Worli on January 16. There he walked till he reached Worli-Koliwada and stayed in a room where the pub staff hired by Pandey stayed. “On Jan 17, in the afternoon he left Worli and reached Thane and hid in a labour camp before he was arrested,” said the police.DCP (Zone IX) Dikshit Gedam said, ""He had illegally entered the country before reaching Mumbai. He was in Mumbai and Thane for the last six months and has used different names. We are collecting details about the documents he has created. He moved to Thane a few months ago before he returned to Mumbai 15 days ago before executing the offence. He was working with some housekeeping agency in Thane before he committed the offence and was caught within 72 hours.""""He was in urgent need of money and planned to rob anyone and immediately escape to Bangladesh,’’ said another officer. During the search at Thane, the police team had almost given up hope after combing the area on the city’s outskirts through the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. By 2am, they had scanned 30-40 acres of land comprising nullahs and thorny bushes. The seniors kept egging their juniors on. Finally, the breakthrough came when one of them shone a torch on some bushes and found the accused lying there.","The colour and pattern of his shoes were the clearest markers in identifying the suspect across locations.

CHANDIGARH: Elusive gangster Harpreet Singh alias Happy Passia is no ordinary fugitive. His roots are modest — a matriculate from an agriculturist family in Passia village of Punjab’s Amritsar district. Yet his ascent in the criminal world has been anything but humble. Currently said to be hiding in US, Passia is allegedly the mastermind behind a recent string of grenade attacks in Punjab. He uses “burner” phone numbers, each with a different country code, to avoid detection and communicate with “gullible youth” enlisted as “foot soldiers” for terrorist strikes in Punjab , a state police officer said. NIA has been on his trail, tracking several phone numbers tied to Passia.He travelled to Dubai in 2018 and returned in 2019. “He went to London in 2020 and did not return,” a police officer said. Passia has criminal associates in UK, where he spent a few months in 2020-21 before moving to US, slipping across the Mexico border through illegal channels, according to details compiled by Punjab police and accessed by TOI. Passia’s criminal dossier is extensive. He is wanted in 17 cases under laws such as UAPA, Arms Act, and NDPS Act. Twelve of these cases were filed between Nov 2022 and April 2024.The saga turns darker with Passia’s alleged collaboration with Pakistan-based Harwinder Singh alias Rinda, a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist. Together, they coordinate attacks in Punjab. Passia has been declared a fugitive, with a Chandigarh court issuing an arrest warrant against him last week on an NIA application.","Harpreet Singh alias Happy Passia is wanted in 17 cases under laws such as UAPA, Arms Act, and NDPS Act.

Saif Ali Khan’s condition

NEW DELHI: A man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was arrested on Sunday in Thane. The person was identified as Mohammad Sharif Ul Islam Shehzad, also known as Vijay Das, aged 30. A Bangladeshi national, he entered India via the West Bengal border six months ago.“There is primary evidence to anticipate that the accused is a Bangladeshi. He does not have valid Indian documents. There are some seizures that indicate that he is a Bangladeshi national...As of now, we think that the accused has entered the residence (of Saif Ali Khan) for the first time,” said DCP Zone 9 Dikshit Gedam.“Prima facie the accused is a Bangladeshi and after entering India illegally he changed his name. He was using Vijay Das as his current name. He came to Mumbai 5-6 months ago. He stayed in Mumbai for a few days and then in the vicinity of Mumbai. The accused used to work in a housekeeping agency,” Gedam added.He is currently held at Khar Police Station.Earlier, a suspect was questioned in Mumbai but cleared of involvement. Another suspect, Aakash Kanojia, was arrested in Chhattisgarh and handed over to Mumbai Police.Police have recovered part of the weapon used in the attack at Khan’s residence.The accused's lawyer challenged the police’s statement that Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national, entered India six months ago, saying that the accused has been living in Mumbai for over seven years with his family.""The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement. He has been living here for more than 7 years,"" said advocate Sandeep Shekhane.Accused Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad was presented before the Bandra Holiday Court in Mumbai, which granted a 5-day police custody. The defence counsel raised concerns about the legality of the arrest, but the magistrate dismissed these arguments, stating they lacked sufficient reasoning. The prosecution argued that the accused, a Bangladeshi national, could be involved in a larger international conspiracy, which the magistrate considered while granting police custody.The man arrested in connection with the attack on Saif was produced before a Mumbai court on Sunday for police remand. The accused, was brought to the holiday court in Bandra at 1:30pm. Police sought his remand after his arrest in Thane city. According to the preliminary investigation, Shehzad entered Khan’s Bandra residence, Satguru Sharan building, early on January 16 with the intent to steal.The arrested suspect, Mohammed Shariful Islam, reportedly operated under several aliases, including Bijoy Das and Mohammed Iliyas. He worked for a housekeeping agency in Mumbai for a while before moving to Thane. He returned to Mumbai 15 days prior to committing the offense. DCP Dikshit Gedam stated that relevant sections of the Passport Act and the Foreigners Act, in addition to other BNS sections, will be added. The accused was identified as Bangladeshi, with a document or ID found in his possession, according to the DCP.Authorities are investigating whether the stabbing was a botched burglary attempt or a premeditated assault on the actor. Early reports suggested the intruder may have been familiar with the building’s layout and security lapses, leading to speculation about his intent.Investigators relied heavily on CCTV footage, which showed the suspect moving through the building and later buying earphones at a nearby shop. Statements from the actor’s staff and neighbours also helped police piece together the suspect’s movements on the night of the attack.The horrifying incident unfolded at around 2.30am in Khan’s Bandra apartment. The intruder allegedly entered the premises unnoticed and confronted the actor’s son’s nanny, Philip, near the child’s room.Philip recounted in her statement that the man threatened her to stay silent and attacked when she resisted, injuring her hands and wrists. Saif Ali Khan intervened to protect his family but was stabbed multiple times during the altercation.The actor sustained serious injuries, including a 2.5-inch blade lodged in his thoracic spine, and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital. His wife, Kareena Kapoor, and staff member Geeta also suffered minor injuries during the chaos.Mumbai Police had mobilised 20 teams to investigate the incident, including officers from the Crime Branch and Bandra Police Station. No signs of forced entry were found, suggesting the intruder exploited a security lapse.The Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) has written to the Mumbai Police Commissioner requesting enhanced security for the actor.Doctors at Lilavati Hospital successfully removed the knife shard from Khan’s spine. The actor underwent emergency surgery and has since been moved from the ICU to a regular room. Neurosurgeons also treated deep wounds on his neck and hand, which required plastic surgery.Dr Niraj Uttamani, Chief Operating Officer of the hospital, said, “Saif is stable and recovering well. He remains under observation but is expected to make a full recovery soon.”","The man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was arrested on Sunday in Thane.

Netanyahu Signs 'Surrender Deal' With Hamas; Israeli Cabinet Okays Gaza Hostage Pact | Watch

A ceasefire in the Gaza Strip came into effect on Sunday as Hamas released the first three hostages it had held for 15 months during the devastating war with Israel.The truce, which began at 11:15 am local time (0915 GMT) following a delay of nearly three hours, was facilitated through months of indirect negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt.As part of the initial phase of the agreement, the release of the three hostages is set to be followed by Israel’s release of 90 Palestinian prisoners.US President Joe Biden hailed the ceasefire in Gaza, saying the ""region has been fundamentally transformed."" ""After so much pain, death and loss of life, today the guns in Gaza have gone silent,"" the outgoing president said.""The deal that I first put forward last May for the Middle East has finally come to fruition. The ceasefire has gone an effect in Gaza and today we're seeing hostages being released. By the 16th day of the deal, talks will begin in a second phase. This phase includes the release of Israeli soldiers and a permanent end of the war without Hamas in power or able to threaten Israel. 100s of trucks are entering Gaza as I speak. They're carrying assistance for civilians who suffered enormously from the war that Hamas started on October 7, 2023, nearly 15 months ago,"" Biden added.Nearly 5 hours after the ceasefire began, three Israeli hostages were handed over to Red Cross workers by Hamas in Gaza.The Red Cross said that the three Israeli hostages were transferred to them and are on their way toward IDF and ISA forces in the Gaza Strip.The first three Israeli hostages that were be freed were 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher, dual British-Israeli Emily Damari, 28, and 24-year-old Romi Gonen.Hamas says for every hostage released, 30 Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.Israel has confirmed that the ceasefire will begin at 11.15am local time today, after Hamas provided a list of hostages set for release. The truce, initially planned for 8.30 am, was delayed due to Hamas’ late submission of the names of three female hostages.Israel also shared the list of the 33 hostages that will be released as part of the ceasefire. It said that the list includes the oldest and the youngest hostages that were taken by Hamas.Hamas has named three hostages it plans to release on Sunday, potentially allowing the delayed Gaza ceasefire to begin. Israel had insisted on receiving the names before halting its military actions.Gaza's civil defence agency reported that Israeli airstrikes on Sunday killed at least eight people and injured over 25. The strikes targeted northern Gaza and Gaza City, where three died in the north and five in the city. The attack followed Israel’s announcement of a delayed ceasefire in the ongoing conflict.Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, faced a major political setback as his party, Jewish Power, resigned from the government on Sunday. The resignations, a protest against the Gaza ceasefire deal, do not dissolve the coalition but destabilise it, weakening Prime Minister Netanyahu’s position while the ceasefire talks continue.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday delayed the ceasefire deal with Hamas and reiterated that the ceasefire deal will not proceed ""without a list of hostages.""""The prime minister instructed the IDF (military) that the ceasefire, which is scheduled to take effect at 8:30 am, will not begin until Israel has received the list of released hostages, as Hamas has committed to providing,"" the Israeli PM's office said.Earlier, Netanyahu had said that Israel reserves the right to resume war, with US support, if necessary. Netanyahu demanded the hostages' names be provided by Sunday before the prisoner swap, amid uncertainty over the status of the 33 hostages.Hamas responded to Netanyahu's allegations and said that the delay was due to ""technical reasons"".""The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons,"" it said.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have confirmed that missile strikes were carried out on Hamas targets in Gaza, with the ongoing ceasefire not yet taking effect.In a statement, the IDF revealed that artillery shelling and drone strikes targeted several Hamas sites in northern and central Gaza.The military said that the operations are part of their continued efforts to neutralise ""terrorist threats"" in the region. ""The IDF continues to operate and strike terror targets in the Gaza Strip,"" the statement said. ""We are fully prepared for defence and attack, ensuring the safety and security of Israel's residents.""Meanwhile, alerts were activated at around 9.00am in Sderot and Eviv, but the IDF clarified that these alerts were the result of a false identification.On Saturday, Israel's Cabinet approved a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, set to release numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas. This marks a potential turning point in the ongoing violence. Although Qatar and the US announced the ceasefire on Wednesday, delays were caused by last-minute complications raised by Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding Hamas.The Cabinet's decision to meet beyond the Jewish Sabbath underscored the critical nature of these discussions, given traditional Jewish law restrictions on government activities during the Sabbath.The Israel-Hamas ceasefire was set to begin on Sunday at 6.30 GMT, marking a crucial pause in the 15-month conflict. The deal, mediated by Qatar, the US, and Egypt, includes a hostage and prisoner exchange as the first step towards de-escalation.Initially, three Israeli hostages will be released in return for Palestinian prisoners, with a total of 33 hostages to be freed in the first 42 days. In exchange, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian detainees.","Hamas has named three hostages it plans to release on Sunday, potentially allowing the delayed Gaza ceasefire to begin. Israel had insisted on receiving the names before halting its military actions.

Michelle and Obama are now 'just friends': Report

Where is Michelle Obama?

Amid speculations over the marital status of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as Michelle refuses to appear alongside Barack Obama at back-to-back protocol-breaking events, rumors that actor Jennifer Aniston has been dating Barack Obama resurfaced on social media. This link-up is not new as a magazine did a cover story on this rumored affair titled: 'The Truth About Jen & Barack!'.On the Jimmy Kimmel Show in October, Jennifer Aniston was asked about the cover story and Aniston strongly denied the claims. ""Of all the calls you get from your publicist where you're just like 'Oh, no, what's it gonna be?' or you get an email saying some cheesy tabloid is gonna make up a story - and then it's that…"" Aniston said adding that she was not mad about the cover story though it was absolutely untrue.""I've met him [Obama] once. I know Michelle more than him,"" Jennifer Aniston said. ""Is there a truth about you and Michelle?"" Jimmy Kimmel asked. ""That is not true,"" Jen said.According to reports, Jennifer Aniston met Barack Obama first and the only time in 2007 -- at a star-studded Hollywood gala.A Radaronline report said Barack and Michell were ""just friends"" amid their ""crumbling marriage after the couple were hit by the wild Jenifer Aniston affair rumors"". They have been living increasingly separate lives in recent years, the report said adding that Michelle was let down by the Jennifer Aniston rumors.""The Obamas are having a tough time, there's no doubt about that. Their once solid marriage has come under strain and for the first time, they're struggling to keep a lid on their problems. The Aniston 'affair' attention was unwanted and Michelle felt let down by it all. But the reality is they are more like friends at the moment, the spark has gone and they're simply going through the motions,"" Radar Online reported citing insiders.Amid the speculations, Barack Obama posted a heartfelt birthday wish for Michelle calling her the ""love of my life"". ""Happy birthday to the love of my life, @MichelleObama. You fill every room with warmth, wisdom, humour and grace -- and you look good going it. I'm so lucky to be able to take on life's adventures with you. Love You!"" Barack posted.Michelle Obama missed the funeral of Jimmy Carter and was the only former first lady to have done son. Her office confirmed that there was a scheduling clash and she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii. Then it was informed that she would not attend Donald Trump's inauguration. Though both decisions could have been triggered by Michelle's hatred for Donald Trump, her absence was also seen as a message of her marital discord as reports claimed she was not happy seeing Barack Obama chatting with Donald Trump at Carter's funeral.","Rumors that Barack Obama and Jennifer Aniston are dating became intense amid speculations over Barack-Michelle divorce.

BENGALURU: A woman fought off an internet technician who tried to sexually abuse her when he went to her north Bengaluru home to fix a connection fault recently.Police swung into action following a complaint filed by Sinchana (name changed), a software engineer, and arrested the accused, Harish Babu, 25, a resident of Byatarayanapura, Ballari Road.Police said Sinchana quit her job two months ago to take care of her child, while her husband, also a software engineer, works with a private firm. Sinchana told Amruthahalli police Friday night that the incident happened between 5pm and 6.30pm on that day. The couple had taken a BSNL internet connection from an e-distributor. As there was a problem with the internet, she contacted the customer care number of the service provider and raised a complaint.Babu visited her home around 4.30pm when she was with her son and her husband at work. After checking the internet router in the bedroom, he told Sinchana that the problem could be because of the wire being cut somewhere. He claimed that one of his colleagues was checking on the wire and called someone over the phone, asking him to repair it. He stayed in the house for some time.He later told Sinchana that his colleague was under the influence of alcohol, so he was not able to identify where the wire was cut. He went out telling her that he would fix the fault himself and would be back in a few minutes.Sinchana told police that Babu came back after 15 minutes and said he had fixed the wire. He asked her to check on the router. As she walked into the bedroom and was checking on the router, Babu followed her from behind and hugged her, she said.

I have not done this. Those who have done so are being let go. One IPS [officer] involved,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.""I always wear a chain of rudraksh on my neck. If I committed the crime my chain would have been broken in place of occurrence. I can't commit this crime,"" he added.Roy has been sent to judicial custody and the sentencing is set to take place on Monday.""The accused will be heard on Monday. Now he is being sent to judicial custody. His punishment will be announced on Monday. I have fixed the time at 12.30 to hear the case,"" the Additional District Judge at Sealdah court said.Concerns regarding the involvement of more than one person and tampering of the evidence have been raised by several people.""The court has convicted him (Sanjay Roy), but the people of West Bengal believe that more than one person may have been involved in the incident. When the case was being investigated for five days by the Kolkata Police, evidence was tampered with in those five days...We want strict punishment to be given...The RG Kar incident has exposed that the law and order situation in the state of West Bengal is not good..,"" Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said.Furthermore, a junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Aniket Mahato, reiterated similar views and questioned how Roy, a civic volunteer, gained access to the premises to commit the crime."" What we have been saying since day one, this man is a civic volunteer and how did he enter the medical college and commit this kind of a crime. Evidence was tampered with, destruction has been done, and it is mentioned in the CBI chargesheet, for whom was this done? to save Sanjay Roy? How can we believe this? We still believe that there are more culprits involved in this case who are roaming around freely. So, please arrest all and punish them...our fight will continue because more than one person is involved in this crime...justice has not been delivered yet, this is just a first step..,"" he said.Meanwhile, CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat has raised concerns about a deeper conspiracy behind the crime.""... Everyone knows Sanjay Roy is guilty but who are the powers behind him?... This has happened due to a corrupt nexus. The government, the principal (of RG Kar) and the whole administration are guilty because of whom such an incident took place..,"" she said.The rape and murder of a 28-year-old postgraduate medical trainee, whose body was found in a hospital seminar room on August 9 sparked nationwide protests demanding justice for the victim and a safer environment for the medics.Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer with Kolkata Police, was arrested the following day in connection with the crime.Roy was convicted under Section 64 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for rape, along with Sections 66 and 103(1) for causing death and committing murder. Notably, Section 103(1) of the BNS prescribes a maximum penalty of either life imprisonment or the death sentence.The incident sparked nationwide outrage, prompting the high court to hand over the investigation to the CBI, which later submitted its chargesheet to the sessions court. The case also reached the Supreme Court, which took suo motu cognizance to establish guidelines for doctors' workplace safety and oversee the investigation's progress.","A Kolkata court on Saturday found main accused Sanjay Roy guilty in the RG Kar rape and murder case.

Ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration, progressive Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared to say in a video that she wouldn’t be attending Donald Trump’s inauguration since he was a ‘rapist’. In a video that has since gone viral on X, AOC says: “Congresswoman, are you going to the inauguration? Let me make myself clear. I don't celebrate rapists.”Harry Sisson, a liberal influencer who recently met Joe Biden wrote: “I love AOC’s response when asked if she’s going to Trump’s inauguration “I don’t celebrate rapists. So, no. I’m not going to the inauguration tomorrow.” Boom.”Donald Trump's inauguration guest list reportedly includes foreign dignitaries , tech and business executives, three of the richest men in the world, former presidents, and an assortment of performers and celebrities. Here is a look at those planning to attend the event and some notable absentees.China’s Vice President, Han Zheng, will represent Xi Jinping, whom Trump had invited to the inauguration. From Latin America, Javier Milei, the right-wing populist president of Argentina, is reportedly attending. However, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former president and another right-wing populist, will not, as his passport was seized by Brazilian federal police, and a Supreme Court justice denied his request to travel.From Europe, Italy’s right-wing Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, has confirmed her attendance. Meanwhile, Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister and a Trump ally, received an invitation but has declined to attend. Representatives from key US allies in the Asia-Pacific region will also attend, including India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, three of the world’s richest men, were initially expected to sit in a place of honour on the dais before the ceremony was moved indoors. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, and Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s CEO, were also invited to the dais.Seating for high-profile business donors was already competitive before the last-minute venue change. Reports suggest some donors offered as much as $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee without securing access to the event or accompanying receptions.Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton will attend the inauguration, as they did for Trump’s first ceremony eight years ago. However, they will not join the traditional lunch with the president-elect, according to NBC News.Former Vice President Mike Pence is also expected to attend, per sources familiar with the planning. He received an invitation, as is customary for all former presidents and vice presidents.Carrie Underwood is scheduled to perform ""America the Beautiful"" at the inauguration, according to the programme of events. Victor Willis, the last surviving founding member of the Village People—whose music frequently features at Trump rallies—announced on Facebook that the group accepted an invitation to participate in the festivities.Several athletes and musicians are also set to attend, including American football player Antonio Brown, boxer Mike Tyson, martial artist Jorge Masvidal, and ice hockey player Evander Kane. Musicians Anuel AA, Justin Quiles, Rod Wave, Kodak Black, and Fivio Foreign have also confirmed their attendance, according to NBC News.Notable AbsenteesWhile Barack Obama is attending, former First Lady Michelle Obama will not. A statement from her office did not specify a reason but noted she had also missed other events this month, including the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter, which all other living former presidents and first ladies attended.Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a prominent Trump adversary during his first term, will also skip the inauguration. At 84, Pelosi is recovering from a hip replacement after a fall during an official trip to Luxembourg. While she has resumed attending House votes, her spokesperson did not provide a reason for her absence. Long-standing animosity between Pelosi and Trump likely plays a role.","Barack Obama, George W.

Trump vows to roll back executive actions by his predecessor



“We’re going to give them the best first day, the biggest first week and the most extraordinary first 100 days of any presidency in American history,” said Trump, who also promised to roll back executive actions by his predecessor, outgoing President Joe Biden, “within hours.""

""Very soon we will begin the largest deportation exercise in American history. Before this, nobody could even think of open borders, prisons, mental institutions, men playing in women's sports, transgenders for everyone... Very soon we will begin the largest deportation exercise in American history.""

'I will prevent World War 3'

""I will end the war in Ukraine, I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War 3 from happening - and you have no idea how close we are.""

He said he would make announcements in his inaugural address on Monday that would be ""the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen.""

'We are going to take back our country'

""We are going to make our country greater than ever before... We are going to take back our country tomorrow at noon ( referring to his inauguration day as the 47th US President). The curtain closes on 4 long years of American decline and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride.""

Trump also reiterated his commitment to dismantling the existing political structure, saying, ""Once and for all, we are going to end the reign of a failed, corrupt political establishment... We are not going to take it anymore.""

""Before even taking office, you are seeing results no one expected to see. Everyone is calling it the ' Trump Effect .' It's you. You are the effect,"" Trump told rally attendees.

On TikTok

""As of today, TikTok is back. You know, I did a little TikTok thing. We have a guy, TikTok Jack. He's a young kid, like 21 years old. We hired this guy and I went on TikTok. We went on TikTok as Republicans never won the youth vote. They won a lot of votes, but they never won the youth vote. But we won the youth vote by 36 points. So I like TikTok.

""Who in this audience goes with TikTok? Many? Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save a lot of jobs. We don't want to give our business to China. We don't want to give our business to other people. So, I said, I'll approve, but let the United States own 50 per cent of TikTok. I'm approving on behalf of the nation. So, they'll have a partner, the United States, and they'll have a lot of bidders, and we will do what we call a joint venture deal.""

"'Without telling cops, Odisha hospital disposed of Naba Das's shirt'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/without-telling-cops-odisha-hospital-disposed-of-naba-dass-shirt/articleshow/117383650.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: Days after Naba Das’s daughter demanded a CBI probe into her father’s 2023 assassination, it has now emerged that the slain BJD leader ’s blood-stained shirt was disposed of by hospital authorities without informing the police.Sources within the crime branch told TOI that the hospital incinerated the shirt before law enforcement agencies could obtain it as evidence. “When we questioned, the hospital administration cited Covid protocols as justification for burning the shirt. They could not explain when told that Covid regulations were not in effect in 2023. They even could not explain the reason for not informing law enforcement agencies,” a senior crime branch officer said.The crime branch said they obtained written document from the hospital, acknowledging the incineration of the slain minister’s blood-stained shirt. This evidence has been submitted in the court in Jharsuguda, where the trial is in progress.Police arrested assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gopal Das for gunning down Naba at a public gathering in Jharsuguda on Jan 29, 2023. Gopal, who allegedly believed there was threat to his life from Naba, which apparently resulted in the BJD leader’s assassination, is in judicial custody and undergoing trial.Experts, however, dismissed suggestions that the absence of the blood-soaked shirt would weaken the prosecution’s stand. “The forensic team collected ample evidence from the crime scene, including blood samples, pistol, fingerprints, and bullet fragments to substantiate the prosecution’s stand in court. Video footage and multiple eyewitnesses confirmed seeing the accused and the deceased’s blood-stained garment,” Debasis Das, a senior lawyer, said.The law enforcement agency said they have built a strong case based on DNA analysis, ballistic reports and witness testimonies. “The court proceedings will rely on scientific evidence and electronic records rather than physical clothing evidence. Modern forensic techniques provide substantial proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt,” said P K Swain, a retired SP.On Feb 15, 2023, Gopal confessed to his crime before a judicial magistrate, but last week his lawyer Naresh Nayak claimed he was innocent. Nayak suggested the minister’s death resulted from shots fired by an unknown assailant, and not Gopal.Nayak pointed out that while the crime branch claimed Gopal had fired three bullets at Naba, five gunshot holes were discovered in a vehicle behind the slain minister’s car. A crime branch officer explained that one bullet had struck the minister’s chest, with two others hitting the vehicle behind. They clarified that the five holes resulted from entry and exit points of two bullets, dismissing theories of multiple attackers.","Police arrested assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gopal Das for gunning down Naba at a public gathering in Jharsuguda on Jan 29, 2023.

He expressed regret over the misunderstanding, calling it an ""unfortunate situation.""The remarks, initially intended as banter, sparked controversy and led Djokovic to boycott a routine post-match interview.The 37-year-old tennis legend declined to participate in the customary on-court interview after his straight-sets victory over Jiri Lehecka at Rod Laver Arena on Sunday evening, securing a spot in the quarter-finals.Djokovic later explained his decision was a protest against Tony Jones, a leading sports presenter for Channel Nine, accusing him of making ""insulting and offensive comments"" about him and his Serbian fans.Djokovic announced he would avoid interviews with the broadcaster until an apology was issued.On Monday, Jones addressed the issue, saying, ""The comments were made during the news on Friday night, and I intended them as banter—humour in line with what I usually do. However, I was informed by Tennis Australia via Djokovic’s camp on Saturday morning that they were deeply unhappy with those remarks.""Jones said he promptly reached out to Djokovic’s camp and apologised.

Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Monday following the return of three Israeli hostages who were freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza. Outside Ofer prison, near Ramallah in the West Bank, Palestinians gathered to welcome the released detainees, with fireworks lighting up the sky as white buses transported them through the gates.The Palestinian Authority's Commission for Prisoners' Affairs confirmed that the released individuals comprised women and minors. Israel had detained these people for various security-related offences, ranging from stone-throwing to allegations of attempted murder.Palestinians criticised the late-night timing of the release as a deliberate attempt to reduce celebrations. The Israeli military, which maintains control of the West Bank, issued strict warnings against public celebrations.Among those released was Khalida Jarrar, 62, a prominent figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP, a secular leftist group, was known for attacks against Israel in the 1970s but has reduced its militant activities recently. Jarrar had been held under administrative detention orders since December 2023.Other notable releases included Dalal Khaseeb, 53, sister of the late Hamas official Saleh Arouri, who died in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut in January 2024, and Abla Abdelrasoul, wife of imprisoned PFLP leader Ahmad Saadat.This exchange forms part of the initial phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Trump's Huge TikTok Announcement In US; Chinese App's CEO Thanks President-Elect | Watch

US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said he had not made a final decision but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after his inauguration on Monday.Under a law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, TikTok's China-based parent company was given nine months to sell its US operations to an approved buyer. The law, set to take effect on Sunday, prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to US users. However, the sitting president has the authority to grant an extension if a sale is underway.Trump told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview, ""I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate. You know, it's appropriate."" He added, ""We have to look at it carefully. It's a very big situation.""The President-elect said if he decides to grant the extension, he will likely announce it on Monday.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco clarified on Friday that the Biden administration would leave implementing the law to Trump, given that his inauguration falls the day after the ban takes effect.In a statement released Friday, TikTok requested a definitive response from the Biden administration, asking that it not enforce the law or fine app store operators and other US companies if TikTok remains available after Sunday. Without assurances, TikTok warned it might ""go dark,"" without specifying whether it would voluntarily suspend its US operations or shut down after losing access to essential service providers.On Saturday, the White House dismissed TikTok's statement as a ""stunt."" Jean-Pierre said, ""We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said his government would not be able to move forward with the truce unless they had received a list of hostages who would be released by Hamas.Netanyahu also said that Israel reserved the ""right to resume war if necessary"" with US support.""We will be unable to move forward with the framework until we receive the list of the hostages who will be released, as was agreed. Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible,"" Netanyahu said in a post on X.The Israeli PM demanded that names of hostages to be freed on Sunday before the prisoner swap , reported news agency AFP.Though uncertainty remains regarding the identities of the 33 hostages scheduled for release during the initial six-week phase and their survival status, the second ceasefire of this war will commence on Sunday.In a significant development on early Saturday, Israel's Cabinet endorsed a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, which would secure the release of numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas.This marks a potential turning point in their most devastating confrontation to date.Despite Qatar and the US announcing the ceasefire on Wednesday, the agreement faced delays due to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu citing last-minute complications with Hamas.The Cabinet's decision to meet beyond the start of the Jewish Sabbath highlighted the crucial nature of these discussions. Traditional Jewish law typically restricts government activities during Sabbath except for life-threatening emergencies.Netanyahu has directed a specialised team to prepare for the hostages' return from Gaza, with affected families receiving confirmation of the agreement. The agreement includes the release of numerous Palestinian detainees and promises increased humanitarian assistance to the severely damaged Gaza region.A preliminary list of 737 Palestinian prisoners, primarily women and minors, has already been published by Israel’s justice ministry.The war, triggered by Hamas’s cross-border attack, has left over 46,000 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza’s health ministry, with international calls for a ceasefire growing louder.","Israel's Cabinet endorsed a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, which would secure the release of numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas.

Social media application TitTok on Sunday said it was in the process of restoring service in the United States and thanked President-elect Donald Trump for providing ""necessary clarity and assurance"".The statement came hours after the app suspended its operations in the US to comply with the Biden dispensation's ban order.""In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,"" the application wrote on X.The company said it would work with Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the US.""It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States,"" the statement further read.The social media app discontinued its services in the US after Congress enacted legislation, signed by President Joe Biden last year, mandated TikTok's Chinese parent company to divest its US operations to an approved purchaser within nine months. The legislation also barred internet hosting services and mobile app marketplaces from making TikTok available to American users.Shortly before the ban was implemented, Trump indicated his inclination to provide TikTok with an additional 90 days for deal negotiations, potentially averting the app's prohibition in the United States.Speaking to NBC News, Trump expressed that whilst he had not reached a definitive conclusion, he was contemplating offering TikTok a temporary relief following his assumption of office on Monday.Additionally, The New York Times reported Shou Zi Chew that the chief executive of TikTok has received an invitation to the presidential inauguration ceremony, where they will be seated in ""a position of honour"".","Social media application TitTok on Sunday said it was in the process of restoring service in the United States.

End Russia-Ukraine war

Delay TikTok ban



'Largest deportation program in American history'



Close the border



End automatic citizenship for 'children of illegal aliens'



Cut federal funding for schools pushing 'transgender insanity'



Pardon January 6, 2021, Capitol attack convicts



Demolish 'deep state'



Declare national energy emergency



25% tariff on everything imported from Mexico, Canada



'Will end the electric vehicle mandate'



From ending Russia-Ukraine war to launching mass deportations , it's going to be the busiest day in US Presidential history as one looks at the promises made by Donald Trump to be kept on the very first day of assuming office.The critics are on their toes, ready to analyze the ticks and crosses from Trump's to-do list as the inauguration day on Monday comes to an end.Trump, however, seems to exude confidence in his second term at the office. “Your head will spin when you see what’s going to happen,” he said of Day 1.“I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” he told Fox News Channel.Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that that Trump would bring the Russian and Ukrainian leaders to the negotiating table on Day 1. However, this does not align with his promise to end the war before Monday.""I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,"" he said in a post on X on Sunday.He added that he would propose to acquire 50% stake in the Chinese application.""I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without US approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions. Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the US and whichever purchase we so choose,"" he said.“The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. ... On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump had said at a rally in Kinston, North Carolina on November 3, 2024.State police and National Guard units may assist federal agents in a major effort to locate and deport millions of people. This approach, aimed at deterring illegal immigration, is largely untested. While illegal crossings surged under the Biden administration, they have recently dropped to near a four-year low.""And on Day 1, I will close the border, and I will stop the invasion of illegal criminals coming into our country,"" he said at Coachella rally on October 12, 2024.This is aimed at shifting to introducing Day 1 administrative actions to strengthen enforcement against criminal entry.“I will sign a Day 1 executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of illegal aliens,” he said at a rally in Pickens, South Carolina on July 1, 2023.Trump is unlikely to fulfill his promise through an executive order, as birthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution. Changing this would require a challenging effort to gain congressional approval and amend the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to all individuals born or naturalized in the United States.“On Day 1, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school, pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the shoulders of our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,"" he said at a rally in Atlanta on August 3, 2024.Achieving such extensive cuts through executive action alone is unlikely, especially without the necessary legislation, which won’t be in place on Trump’s first day.Trump had also promised to roll back the Biden administration's Title IX protections against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. But this month, a federal judge ruled that those regulations overstepped presidential authority and struck them down.“The moment we win, we will rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner unjustly victimized by the Harris regime, and I will sign their pardons on Day 1,” he said at Wisconsin rally on September 7, 2024.In another interview, when asked about pardoning Capitol attack rioters, Trump said, “Oh, absolutely, I would. If they’re innocent -- if they’re innocent, I would pardon them.”“We will demolish the ‘deep state.’ We will expel the warmongers from our government. We will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the communist, Marxists and fascists. We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will rout the fake news media,” he said at New Hampshire rally in 2023.“We’re going to find the ‘deep state’ actors who have buried into government, fire them and escort them from federal buildings, and it’ll go very quickly,” he said at South Carolina rally on January 28, 2023.This refers to entrenched civil servants who have caused frustration for Trump and his supporters.A likely first step for Trump is an executive order to reclassify tens of thousands of job-protected, apolitical civil servants as political appointees, making them subject to dismissal at will. This would involve reviving his Schedule F order from 2020, which was reversed by Biden upon taking office.“I will immediately issue a national emergency declaration to achieve a massive increase in domestic energy supply,” he said at New York Economic Club speech in September last year.“Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape,” he said at Michigan rally.A national emergency could grant him greater authority to act unilaterally, although it's uncertain how much can be achieved without congressional action. However, he can reverse Biden's executive orders on renewable energy and environmental protections.“On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States,” he said, adding, “we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States.”During his first term, Trump imposed higher tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods. As president, Joe Biden not only kept these penalties in place but also introduced a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.Trump strongly supports raising tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing, but his threat may also serve as a bargaining tool. The specific size and scope of the tariffs could vary depending on how the three countries respond before he assumes office.“I will cancel Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate,” he said at Grand Rapids, Michigan on November 4, 2024.He is likely to attempt relaxing Biden-era tailpipe pollution and fuel economy standards, which encourage automakers to produce and consumers to purchase more electric vehicles.","Donald Trump promised to end Russia-Ukraine war and end automatic citizenship for 'children of illegal aliens' Cut federal funding for schools pushing 'transgender insanity' Pardon January 6, 2021, Capitol attack convicts.

Pak authorities demolish pre-Partition Ahmadi worship place,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-authorities-demolish-pre-partition-ahmadi-worship-place/articleshow/117361970.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.
