Le Pen's eurosceptic National Rally (RN) party leads opinion polls by a huge margin, with as much as 33% of the vote, or about twice as much as what is forecast for Macron's, centrist, pro-EU party. ""My dear compatriots, wake up, look closely at who they are!,"" Macron told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview, speaking of the RN. ""I'm willing to debate with Mrs Le Pen,"" Macron said. ""The ball is in her camp.""

Le Pen immediately replied on X that she was willing to debate, but only on the condition that Macron agreed to resign or call snap parliamentary elections if his party loses on June 9 - which he would have no reason to agree to. Macron beat Le Pen in two presidential election runoffs, in 2017 and 2022, but her popularity has kept growing since.

The identity of the third person killed has not been released, as reported by Al Jazeera.The deaths are the latest in months of spiraling violence in Port-au-Prince, which remains largely under the control of powerful armed groups that have unleashed a wave of deadly attacks across the city.This incident comes after Kenyan President William Ruto visited President Joe Biden and other senior US leaders in the US to discuss a range of issues, including the long-stalled Haiti deployment .""The security situationin Haiti cannot wait,"" Al Jazeera quoted the National Security Council spokesperson as saying on Friday.

"Four years after George Floyd killing, police reform slow to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/four-years-after-george-floyd-killing-police-reform-slow-to-follow/articleshow/110421607.cms,"George Floyd act stalled

'Not enough'

Stevante Clark felt a glimmer of hope when racial justice protests swept the globe in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd. His own brother, Stephon Clark, was killed by Sacramento police in March 2018 after they fired 20 shots at the young Black man in the backyard of his grandparents' home. Police said they feared he had a gun. But he was found to have been holding only a cellphone.The 22-year-old's death sparked protests and calls for reform. It also led to a new more stringent use-of-force law in California. Yet, no comprehensive change emerged on a national level.So, Clark thought Floyd's killing and those of several other Black Americans by police in 2020 would finally deliver the substantive criminal justice reform that he and others have sought for years.But while Floyd's death became a rally cry for racial equity and justice, four years later the journey toward comprehensive policing reform has been fraught with challenges. Momentum has waned and legislative efforts have stalled, leaving communities, advocates, and families who have lost loved ones frustrated by what they see as a shift away from police accountability.""You can't honor the life and legacy of George Floyd without passing comprehensive policy and legislative change to prevent George Floyds from happening,"" Clark told Reuters. ""I don't think the Biden administration has been aggressive enough when it comes to this crisis -- and this is not just a Black fight -- this is for everybody. People have become desensitized by police murder.""Despite the initial surge of calls for change, federal attempts at wide-ranging reform have been mostly unsuccessful.On Friday, President Joe Biden said, ""I will continue to urge Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which ensures law enforcement accountability, to my desk.""A spokesperson for Republican Donald Trump's campaign told Reuters that Trump would take a hardline approach to immigration and violent crime, adding if he is reelected ""he will restore law and order.""The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act - which was initially introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics, misconduct and racial bias - has faced repeated roadblocks in Congress and has yet to move forward.Efforts to reach a bipartisan police reform deal failed in 2021, with Biden blaming Republicans for the failure. Among the issues lawmakers discussed were changes to ""qualified immunity"" laws that protects police officers from some excessive force lawsuits. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill Thursday.Experts say while criminal justice reform efforts in part fueled the 2020 election cycle, policing is unlikely to be a top issue in the 2024 presidential election.""Other issues have come to the fore, especially with conflict in Israel and Palestine, with conflict in Ukraine, and the economy,"" said Jorge Camacho, policy director of the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School.But it still might be one reason Biden has weaker support among Black voters, Camacho said, adding that Black communities want to see action on policing.Recent polling data by a non-profit polling firm, African American Research Collaborative, shows that Black communities are now focusing more on economic issues, like the cost of living crisis and jobs.After Congress failed to pass the George Floyd legislation, Biden signed an executive order in May 2022 that in part created a new national police misconduct database, required federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the use of deadly force or deaths in custody and restricted federal agencies from using chokeholds and ""no knock"" entries.Still a day before the anniversary of Floyd's death, veteran civil rights advocate Rev. Al Sharpton, called on Congress to pass the bill.""The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act fulfills a promise we made four years ago to his and every family of a Black man or woman killed by law enforcement,"" he said, adding it would fulfill what ""we have spent decades marching, protesting, and advocating for.""One of the largest changes that the Biden administration has done in terms of police reform, said Rashawn Ray, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was to rescind a Trump-era policy that curtailed the use of consent decrees to address police violence. Nina Patel, Senior Policy Council at the American Civil Liberties Union, said ""there have been accomplishments on policing accountability, but they have been far less influential than what we would have liked.""She added that policies in states like Louisiana, Arizona and Georgia are making it harder to film police, even though bystander footage often brings cases of brutality to light.""Our position is that reform is not enough,"" said Cicley Gay, Board Chairwoman of Black Lives Matter , adding that incremental reform is insufficient. ""We hear firsthand from many families about not only what they experienced, but the lack of progress and in making policy change.""The Movement for Black Lives, a national network of more than 150 leaders and organizations, is now pushing The People's Response Act, which was introduced by Congresswoman Cori Bush last year.The bill focuses on state and local funding for ""inclusive, holistic, and health-centered approach"" to public safety and would create alternatives to police intervention through the Department of Health and Human Services.The bill is likely to receive significant resistance from Republicans and centrist Democrats, experts say. However, advocates said they will continue to press forward.The ""uprisings around the world were sparked by such a tragic incident that was part of a pattern of instances of police killings, police violence, that our communities have been calling attention to and trying to fight against for such a long time,"" said Amara Enyia, Director for Policy and Research at the Movement for Black Lives.""The arc of our work is not just for us, this is part of a bigger work of justice to which there isn't an end date.""","The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was initially introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics, misconduct and racial bias. The bill has faced repeated roadblocks in Congress and has yet to move forward.

Among the talks he is planning there is one with his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun, the defence department said. The encounter would be part of an effort to patch up ties that have deteriorated over Beijing's aggressive policies toward Taiwan and its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea.US relations with Cambodia have been frosty for years, in large part because of Phnom Penh’s close ties with China. Washington has also been vocal about what it sees as Cambodia’s poor human rights record, which has seen continuing clampdowns on political dissidents and critics.Cambodia is Beijing’s closest ally in Southeast Asia, and Washington is particularly concerned that a naval base in southern Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand has been upgraded with Chinese assistance to serve as a strategic outpost for China’s navy.Cambodian officials deny China will have any special basing privileges and say their country maintains a neutral defence posture.The defence department statement said that Austin will meet with senior officials in Cambodia on his first visit there since attending a gathering of Asian defence ministers in November 2022.“We are now working with the US Embassy in Phnom Penh to arrange his meetings with the Cambodian leaders,” Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chum Sounry said Saturday in response to a query from The Associated Press. “The visit will be another important step to advance the Cambodia-US relations.”It will also be Austin’s first visit to Cambodia since Hun Manet became prime minister last year, succeeding his father Hun Sen, who held office for 38 years. The handover has led to speculation of a reset in US-Cambodian relations, though so far Hun Manet has maintained his father’s policies.Hun Manet was Cambodia’s army commander before becoming prime minister last August. Both Austin and he graduated from the US Military Academy at West Point — Austin in 1975 and Hun Manet in 1999, as Cambodia's first cadet there.From Cambodia, Austin will go to France to attend events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the World War II D-Day landing, the defence department said.On Friday, Austin underwent a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, resuming his duty after temporarily transferring power to his deputy, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.Austin is continuing to deal with bladder issues that arose in December following his treatment for prostate cancer, Ryder said.","US relations with Cambodia have been frosty for years, in large part because of Phnom Penh’s close ties with China.

They vandalized and set fire to his house, assaulting him in the process, before police intervened and rescued the man and his father, AP reported quoting officials.According to Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district, the crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy , threw stones and bricks at the police. He stated that a large contingent of police had cordoned off the settlement, pushed back the crowd, and taken five injured Christians to the hospital.A police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader, said that at least one house and a small shoe factory were set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbors alleged that a minority community member had desecrated the Muslim holy book, the Koran. ""They burned one house and lynched several Christians,"" Bhatti said.Social media videos showed protesters looting items from burning properties and throwing them into a burning heap on the street.The HRCP expressed serious concern about the situation in Sargodha's Gillwala village, where the Christian community is reportedly at grave risk from charged mobs.""HRCP is seriously concerned by the unfolding situation in #Sargodha, where the Christian community in Gillwala village is reportedly at grave risk to their lives at the hands of charged mobs. There are unconfirmed reports of a man having been allegedly lynched,"" the HRCP posted on X.""The Punjab police @OfficialDPRPP and district administration must immediately restore calm and bring the perpetrators to book while ensuring that the Christian community comes to no further harm,"" it added.Last year in August, a similar but larger-scale incident occurred in Jaranwala, Pakistan, where over 21 churches and more than a hundred houses were burned down, some reduced to rubble, in a mob attack over allegations of 'blasphemy'. The incident also involved widespread looting and burning of hundreds of homes across 11 areas in the Faisalabad district. As a result, 10,000 Christians were immediately displaced, and 20,000 were affected by the incident.","A mob of Muslims went on a violent spree in eastern Pakistan following accusations against a Christian man for desecrating the pages of Quran.

Pakistan's Punjab government approves registration of more cases against Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-punjab-government-approves-registration-of-more-cases-against-imran-khan/articleshow/110421656.cms,"LAHORE: Pakistan's Punjab government has approved the registration of more cases against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his party men for inciting hate against the state institutions, especially the powerful Pakistan Army . The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has been in jail since August last year after being convicted in some of the nearly 200 cases slapped on him since his ouster in April 2022.""The Punjab Cabinet of Maryam Nawaz has approved legal action against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder leader Imran Khan and his other party leaders for building a hate narrative against the state institutions,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference after a cabinet meeting on Friday evening.The minister said Khan is trying to become Mujeebur Rehman (of Bangladesh). Mujeebur Rehman had successfully led the Bangladeshi independence movement against Pakistan. He became the first prime minister of Bangladesh in 1971.Bokhari said those who meet Khan in Adiala Jail Rawalpindi also follow him in spreading hate against the institutions.The Punjab government is likely to book Khan and his close associates for writing an article in a British newspaper on a complaint from a journalist, she said.Earlier this month, in an article in The Telegraph newspaper, Khan alleged that the military establishment, under the direct guidance of Gen Asim Munir, the chief of army staff, has tried every tactic to decimate his party's presence from the political environment of Pakistan but failed.""The oppression, torture and denial of our election symbol have been extensively documented, but nothing has worked for the military and the powerless civilian leadership acting as its puppets. Pakistan's general elections on February 8 2024, showed the utter failure of their design.""With no single electoral symbol in a country where the vast majority of voters are guided by a party symbol, the people came out and voted overwhelmingly for candidates supported by my party, the PTI, despite standing as 'independents' with a host of diverse symbols,"" he wrote.Khan further said this democratic revenge by the people of Pakistan against the agenda of the military establishment not only was a national defiance by the people but also a complete rejection of the official state narrative of May 9 2023, when PTI supporters were falsely accused - as a pretext for a crackdown - of attacking military installations.""Instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The constitutional functioning of state institutions must be restored, the military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me.""I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife, Gen Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,"" Khan wrote.",The Punjab government has approved the registration of more cases against Imran Khan.

During these last two decades, in the name of counter-insurgency operations and peace, a large number of young men, mostly students, engineers, doctors, political activists, and journalists have been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security agencies,"" she said.She further stressed that these people have been detained in detention centres, and tortured, and their families didn't know about their whereabouts.""Not for days, but for years, even though there are cases that have been enforcedly disappeared for decades. And the family didn't know that their beloved ones were alive or dead,"" Baloch added.Mahrang Baloch emphasised that even today, it has been practised by fascist states, the oppressive states like Pakistan.She further added, ""Still today, it's been practised by the fascist states, by the oppressive states like Pakistan. During these last two decades, in the name of counter-insurgency operations and peace, many of our assets have forcibly disappeared. And then their mutilated bodies were found in Balochistan. They were being killed in detention centres.""Baloch said that the exact number of disappeared is unknown, as the state has not allowed international groups such as the United Nations or Amnesty International to investigate the nature of this human tragedy.""But when local activists' rights groups tried to document the number or raise their voices, they themselves disappeared. It is very difficult to tell these stories of victims of forced disappearances,"" she said.While sharing her own experience of suffering at the hands of the Pakistani administration Baloch said, ""I myself am a victim. My own father was disappeared by agents of Pakistani state in 2009. He was killed and his bullet-ridden body was found in 2011. When I was at 10th standard that was the day when my result was announced. That day, I found the body of my father, my younger brother disappeared when I was doing my graduation in medicine in 2017.""She highlighted that she campaigned and launched rallies for him in Balochistan, adding that after three months he was released.""But my case is not exceptional. There are worse cases than this in Balochistan. Even though there are victims and there are families where no one is left to tell their stories. And even though there are villages that have been destroyed and no one is here to tell their stories.""In her statement, she also said that there are hundreds of children, teenagers and young people whose fathers, uncles or brothers have been missing for weeks, months and in some of the worst cases years.""They do not know whether they are alive or not. Together with these youngsters, the majority of whom are women. I have been campaigning and pressing the Pakistan Supreme Court , Parliament and security forces to release those who have disappeared or at least present them before a court if they have committed any crime,"" she said.Baloch added that the Pakistani authorities instead of addressing these issues, have resorted to violence.She also mentioned the long march which failed due to the ignorance and ill-treatment of the Pakistani administration.""I marched more than 1600 km in December for over a month and arrived in Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan on a cold evening with children and women. We were beaten, charged, humiliated and tortured by police. The controlled media was used to run a malicious campaign against us. On social media, we were abused and trolled by state accounts,"" she said.Stressing that the journalists were intimidated and stopped from giving the media coverage, Baloch said that the powerful intelligence agencies of Pakistan forced the people not to respond to the peaceful movement.""The media ignored us through our protests. Scams were sent just outside the National Press Club of Islamabad. And there was no coverage of this peaceful movement. We have been sitting there for more than one month,"" she said.Baloch further expressed hope and said that they are hopeful because those who are behind this violence and those who are using violence, are less in number.""Maybe they have the power to rule us. But those who believe in humanity, who believe in peace, we are large in number,"" she added.","Prominent Baloch leader, Mahrang Baloch highlighted the ongoing issue of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

NEW DELHI: Hospitals across Pakistan treated hundreds of heatstroke victims as an intense heatwave pushed temperatures above normal levels. Officials attribute the rising temperatures to climate change.Temperatures reached up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro on Wednesday. The city, located in southern Sindh province, was severely impacted by climate-induced monsoon rains and floods in 2022. The heatwave is expected to persist for at least a week.Authorities have advised people to stay indoors, stay hydrated, and avoid unnecessary travel. However, many laborers say they must continue working to support their families.""Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,"" said Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, during a news conference in Islamabad.Barakullah Khan, a civil defense official, advised people not to leave cooking gas cylinders in open areas and warned those living near fields about the risk of snakes and scorpions entering homes and storage spaces in search of cooler areas.Weather forecasters predicted that temperatures may rise to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) this month.Hospitals in the eastern city of Lahore and in the districts of Hyderabad, Larkana, and Jacobabad in Sindh province have reported treating scores of heatstroke patients.""The situation has been getting worse since yesterday, when people affected by heat started coming to hospitals in the Punjab province,"" said Ghulam Farid, a senior health official. Emergency response centers have been established at hospitals to treat heat-affected patients.The state-run ambulance service is now equipped with bottled water and ice to provide emergency treatment to heat victims.The United Nations children’s agency has called for measures to protect children from the heat. Sanjay Wijesekera, Unicef regional director for South Asia, warned that rising temperatures could put millions of children’s health at risk if they are not protected and hydrated.Heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when body temperature rises too quickly, potentially causing unconsciousness, disability, or death.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall. Last month’s heavy rains caused fatalities and extensive damage to property and farmland.Daytime temperatures have soared as much as 8 degrees Celsius (46 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average May temperatures over the past 20 years, raising concerns about flooding in the northwest due to glacial melting.The 2022 floods caused significant damage in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, resulting in 1,739 deaths nationwide.The heatwave is also affecting Pakistan's southwest and northwest regions. Schools in Punjab have been closed for a week.On Thursday, Save the Children announced that more than half of Pakistan’s school-age children, approximately 26 million, will miss a week of school due to the heatwave. The closure of schools in Punjab means 52% of the country’s students will be out of school.In Lahore, residents have been seen swimming in roadside canals to cool off. Despite contributing less than 1% to global carbon emissions, Pakistan is experiencing severe impacts of climate change.","Temperatures reached up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro on Wednesday.

Pakistan: Gang 'involved' in child abuse apprehended in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-gang-involved-in-child-abuse-apprehended-in-karachi/articleshow/110359022.cms,"KARACHI: In a significant development, Police in Karachi 's Orangi Town have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children, rescuing three minors in the process, according to Pakistan media outlet ARY News.The Superintendent of Police (SP) for Orangi Town revealed that three members of the gang have been apprehended, with an equal number of children recovered by law enforcement.According to the SP, the modus operandi of the gang involved enticing children with sums ranging from PKR 200 to PKR 300 before subjecting them to sexual exploitation . Additionally, the suspects were purportedly engaged in filming the abuse and circulating the videos within the vicinity, as reported by ARY News.The investigation into the matter was initiated following the disappearance of a child on May 11. Subsequent interrogations led to the unraveling of the gang's illicit activities.One of the suspects, identified as Nisar, reportedly enticed children from gaming zones and transported them to the gang's hideout. There, the minors were allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and also trafficked to others.It was disclosed by the police that the gang predominantly targeted children aged between 12 to 14 years.Law enforcement authorities further elaborated that the suspects employed a strategy of wearing a helmet associated with an online motorcycle service to evade detection while transporting the children from one location to another, ARY News reported.Data collected by Sahil, an NGO dedicated to addressing child sexual abuse, reveals a disturbing trend: the majority of abusers are individuals known to the victims, such as acquaintances, neighbours, or even family members.Shockingly, religious teachers and clerics emerge as the primary perpetrators within institutional settings, surpassing even police officers, school teachers, or nuclear family members in the number of complaints filed against them, according to Dawn.Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys ('Cruel Numbers').","Police in Karachi have dismantled a gang allegedly engaged in the sexual abuse of children.
