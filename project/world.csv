For a few hours on Friday morning, a cluster of villages in Maoist-hit Dantewada thought it was a miracle. That they had struck liquid gold, and their wells had magically turned into oil wells overnight.Villagers drew out bucketfuls of petrol. Nearby villages joined in too. There was plenty to go around! The land rates would skyrocket, they thought. But the euphoria vapourised as cops and district officials swarmed the hamlets and went door to door, asking for the petrol to be returned.The oil-in-a-day's work drama happened in Geedam region. When residents of a few villages went to the wells for their morning ablutions, they were surprised when it smelled like petrol. When they drew up buckets of water, what they got was petrol.News spread like wildlife. Gleeful villagers gathered the oil by the bucketful. The 'happy news' reached the administration as well. Officials were alarmed at the potential of a fire disaster and rushed teams to the villages. Officials of a petroleum PSU also arrived. They found that wells were indeed swimming with petrol.A quick check revealed that owner of a nearby fuel pump was bewildered at losing 14,000-litre petrol and had filed a police complaint, suspecting it was stolen. Officials believe the petrol leaked out of an underground 16,000-litre reservoir.Police have sealed off the wells to ensure there is no accident. Fire tenders have been positioned. Electricity supply was shut for fear that a spark would trigger a disaster, and roads were barricaded for hours. People have been asked not to use inflammable items until an all-clear is given.Dantewada collector in-charge Jayant Nahata said one well was affected but villagers say petrol was found in multiple wells. After preliminary probe, police say the reservoir was cracked and the petrol found its way to the groundwater channels, ending up in wells. Police are going around recovering buckets of petrol and the region remains sealed off for the time being.Nahata told TOI that an inquiry was ordered. Hindustan Petroleum was asked to hold a probe too & assist in remedial measures. A thorough testing of 21 samples of ground sources, including soil and water collected from the area surrounding the petrol pump, was done with no traces of odour or petrol found in them. One well was found contaminated. Petrol is being extracted from it using pumps,"" he added.","Villagers in Maoist-hit Dantewada thought it was a miracle when their wells turned into oil wells overnight.

When Hillary Clinton called Tulsi Gabbard a Russian agent



Four-term US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has been named as the director of National Intelligence in Donald Trump's new cabinet. The 43-year-old veteran was the first Hindu in the US Congress and she was often mistaken as of Indian-origin because of her religion. But Tulsi was born in the US territory of American Samoa and was raised in Hawaii and the Philippines. Tulsi Gabbard's mother Carol Porter Gabbard was raised in a multicultural household and became interested in Hinduism. All her children have Hindu names -- Bhakti, Jai, Aryan, Tulsi and Vrindavan. Tulsi also follows Hinduism.Videos of Tulsi chanting Hare Krishna are viral after she became the first Hindu to head US spy agencies.Since her religion made many people think that she is of Indian origin, in 2012, she herself clarified that she had no Indian link. ""I am not of Indian origin,"" Tulsi posted in reply to a message identifying as an Indian-American.Tulsi Gabbard was in the Democratic party for most of her political career. In 2022, she announced her exit from the party and said the party was under the ""complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness"". Gabbard endorsed Donald Trump only a few months before the election and pushed her anti-war stance under a Republican administration.In 2019, when Tulsi Gabbard was running in the presidential primary in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton called her a Russian spy without naming her. “I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said calling Gabbard the favorite of the Russians.“Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,” Gabbard responded to Clinton's allegations.“From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,” she added. “We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.”Tulsi Gabbard was recently put on a terror watchlist by the Biden-Harris administration.",Four-term US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has been named as the director of National Intelligence in Donald Trump's new cabinet.

Trump opens the Gaetz of hell after winning trifecta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-opens-the-gaetz-of-hell-after-winning-trifecta/articleshow/115307656.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA supremo Donald Trump clinched a trifecta on Thursday, winning a narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives in addition to bagging the White House and the Senate. But right from the get-go, the President-elect is testing the limits of his hold on the Grand Old Party (GOP) now infused with MAGA fervor, choosing controversial young loyalists for key posts in his upcoming administration in moves some Republican grandees see as outrageous.If Trump's pick of Tulsi Gabbard as the country's intelligence czar alarmed the US strategic community, his choice of Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz for the post of Attorney General has stunned even GOP lawmakers, some of whom have accused the Florida maverick of sexual misconduct and deviant behavior. At least two Republican lawmakers have explicitly accused Gaetz, 42, of sexual relations with underaged girls, with the spat on this issue pre-dating the 2024 elections.Moments after Trump named him on Wednesday as the putative Attorney General (he will have to be confirmed by the US Senate), Gaetz resigned from the Congressional seat he had just won from Florida, ostensibly to pre-empt a House Ethics Committee report relating to the allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug that was to be released shortly. The report cannot become public if he is not a member of the House (his resignation was accepted with alacrity by the Republican speaker), but anticipation of a media leak is keeping lawmakers on tenterhooks.Gaetz, and for that matter Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominees for Director of National Intelligence and Defense Secretary respectively, will have to undergo a trial by fire in the US Senate confirmation hearings after the President-elect takes office on January 20, 2025. Technically, Presidential appointments for cabinet members and high-ranking administration posts have to be made ""with the advice and consent of the Senate,"" but Senators, who have long prided themselves on being independent-minded, can torpedo nominations by voting them down. The confirmation hearings are also preceded by extensive background checks by intelligence and security agencies, and nominations are often withdrawn if there are any adverse reports.Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and while a majority of the Senators are Trump loyalists , there are independent-minded holdouts who can trip up nominations if they consider them to be unqualified, national security risks, or pose a danger to the party's fortunes. Sometimes they do so out of personal pique.At least four Senators, including Iowa's Chuck Grassley (at 91, the oldest member), Maine's Susan Collins, and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, appear to have reservations about some of Trump nominees, and along with anti-Trumper Mitt Romney, they could trip up the President. Perhaps anticipating this, Trump is insisting on powers to make recess appointments that would circumvent the confirmation process and allow him to install nominees without congressional hearings.“Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments. IMMEDIATELY!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform in a warning shot after MAGA’s preferred choice of Senate leader, Rick Scott, lost out to a more moderate John Thune. Trump's MAGA acolytes such as Senator Tommy Tuberville warned that lawmakers opposing the President-elect's choices will risk losing their seats, arguing that Trump had the mandate to make appointments as he chooses.The Gaetz nomination will be particularly fraught for Trump considering there has already been a circular firefight involving the Florida maverick and senior Republican lawmakers. After losing a scrap to be the House leader, Trump critic-turned-loyalist Kevin McCarthy said “I'll give you the truth why I'm not speaker. It's because one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.” Another GOP lawmaker, TonyGonzales from Texas, was more blunt on a tv show, saying, “I serve with some real scumbags. Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties.”","President-elect is testing the limits of his hold on the Grand Old Party.

When you go in, you know exactly what to expect,"" Trump said in a recent Fox News interview whilst promoting her memoir.Sources familiar with the situation indicate she plans to divide her time primarily between New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, rather than Washington, though they affirm she will maintain her first lady duties and attend significant events. Donald Trump is expected to continue his pattern of spending winter weekends at Mar-a-Lago and summer weekends at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. The Bidens have similarly split their time between Washington and Delaware, though maintaining the White House as their primary weekday residence.Sources indicate that Melania Trump has established a social circle in Florida over the past four years and is likely to maintain these connections.Following the 2016 election, she delayed her White House move until after her son Barron, then 10, completed his school year. Barron, now 18, attends New York University.Sources suggest she will spend considerable time at Trump Tower in New York to be near Barron. She was observed returning with him from Florida on the president-elect's private aircraft on Sunday.""I could not say I'm an empty nester. I don't feel that way,"" Melania Trump told Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt last month.""It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York, study in New York, and live in his home and I respect that. … He's enjoying his college days. I hope he will have a great experience because his life is very different than any other 18-, 19-year-old child,"" she said.This unprecedented arrangement of a first lady choosing not to reside full-time at the White House aligns with Melania Trump's established pattern of non-traditional behaviour.","Melania Trump is unlikely to reside full-time in Washington during her potential second tenure as first lady. She has already declined the traditional meeting with current first lady Jill Biden at the White House. This decision suggests that Trump, who previously redefined the role during her first term, is establishing her independence early.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115277492,imgsize-1177761,width-400,resizemode-4/115277492.jpg"

Presidential aspirations and party switch

Prominence in Trump's circle

Military service and intelligence background

Intelligence sector reform plans

US President-elect Donald Trump selected Tulsi Gabbard , an ex-Democratic congresswoman turned staunch supporter, as director of national intelligence on Wednesday. Gabbard , who holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has combat experience in Iraq, has consistently challenged established foreign policy views.Her selection reflects Trump's preference for appointing foreign policy sceptics who question American military interventions abroad.Trump's official announcement praised Gabbard's ""fearless spirit"" and her potential contribution to intelligence agencies , emphasising ""peace through strength."" The announcement noted her transition from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party , saying she switched ""because of President Trump's leadership and how he has been able to transform the Republican Party, bringing it back to the party of the people and the party of peace.""Roger Stone, Trump's long-time associate who received a presidential pardon in 2020, initially shared the news on his X account, publishing the statement he claimed came directly from Trump.If confirmed, Gabbard would work alongside John Ratcliffe, Trump's CIA director nominee, as a principal intelligence adviser to the White House. Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President's Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii's House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the ""Bhagavad Gita"". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party's leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden's candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by ""an elitist cabal of warmongers"" and ""woke"" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.""Today's Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,"" she said regarding her departure.Her endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump's claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump's debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as ""completely unrecognizable"".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Gabbard's military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Trump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the ""deep state"", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. ""We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,"" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director's role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures. The office has been crucial in identifying and exposing disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran regarding voting and democracy before recent elections. Its responsibilities extend to cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and counterespionage","Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu member of the House of Representatives.

US Election 2024 Results: 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman blames Elon Musk after getting US election result wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-litchman-blames-elon-musk-after-getting-us-election-result-wrong/articleshow/115302097.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



Inside the “Keys to the White House” Model



Concerns Over Democracy



Evaluating the Keys: A System Under Strain



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and Changing Political Dynamics



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century



Allan Lichtman , often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction—suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris would win the US election—to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. Lichtman, renowned for his accurate forecasting of nine out of the last ten US elections, had correctly predicted nine out of ten election outcomes. However, last week, the historian and political scientist’s prediction that Kamala Harris would win the US Presidential election proved incorrect, with Republican Donald Trump returning to the White House.Speaking with News Nation, Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, elaborated on the reasons for his incorrect forecast, citing conservative media platforms and Elon Musk, who reportedly invested millions in Donald Trump’s campaign, as contributing factors. Lichtman also criticised Musk for amplifying disinformation online on topics such as immigration, hurricane relief, and the war in Ukraine, ""tipping the scales,"" as the News Nation report noted.“Disinformation is the primary issue,” Lichtman stated during an appearance on Chris Cuomo’s NewsNation show. “We’ve always had disinformation, but it’s now reached unprecedented levels. Much of the grievances this election were fuelled by it.” He continued, “Scholars have shown that when truth dissolves, democracy follows. Authoritarian regimes take hold not through force but through the manipulation of information, as George Orwell warned in 1984, where war is peace and famine is plenty.”""The basis of my system, the Keys to the White House, is that a rational, pragmatic electorate assesses if the governing party deserves another four years. But when disinformation drives the electorate's view of that party, especially from individuals with immense financial influence, perhaps the foundation of the Keys needs re-evaluation,"" Lichtman concluded.For over forty years, Allan Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House"" model with remarkable accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor was confident that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election, with his model’s indicators pointing towards a Democratic victory. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s sweeping win, Lichtman found himself blindsided, live-streaming his disbelief with his son, Sam. The political forecaster was left questioning what had gone wrong, joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”American historian Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the ""Nostradamus of US elections,"" was left speechless when his prediction of Kamala Harris’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections was proven incorrect. Lichtman and his son, Sam, hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he expressed his bewilderment, saying, “I don’t get it,” as Trump moved steadily towards a victory.Visibly tired and disappointed by the outcome, Lichtman remarked, “Good thing I’ve nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” Meanwhile, battles in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remained “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman noted, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump clinched a historic victory, surpassing the majority required to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the outcome as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.Lichtman expressed his frustration, hoping that Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He struggled to comprehend “how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.” Wrapping up the livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline globally, and America has now joined that trend. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For more than four decades, Lichtman’s ""Keys to the White House"" model has enjoyed a strong track record of accuracy, correctly predicting each presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor expected Harris to win in 2024, relying on the model’s indicators that favoured a Democratic outcome. But Trump’s decisive victory left Lichtman surprised, live-streaming his dismay alongside his son, Sam.Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on 13 true-or-false indicators that assess conditions favouring the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model predicts a loss for the incumbent. The keys encompass factors like economic performance, social stability, candidate charisma, and major policy achievements. Lichtman believed Harris had eight keys in her favour, while Trump fell short on several counts, pointing to a clear Democratic path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s strengths in areas like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators usually benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. Yet, despite these favourable indicators, the electorate leaned unexpectedly towards Trump, leading to his decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model underscores its limitations in capturing an increasingly unpredictable political climate.As the election results became evident, Lichtman’s initial disbelief turned into deeper concerns about democracy’s future. During the livestream, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” voicing his fears of an era marked by the fragility of democratic institutions. His apprehensions went beyond his failed prediction, revealing a broader concern about the future of democratic governance, especially given Trump’s divisive leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman pointed out that once democracy erodes, restoring it becomes a significant challenge. He referenced historical cases where authoritarian regimes ended only after substantial upheavals, like wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, tried to reassure him, optimistically suggesting that Trump’s influence might diminish post-presidency. But Lichtman remained sceptical, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He noted the troubling global trend of eroding democratic norms throughout the 21st century.Since its creation, Lichtman’s model has been celebrated as a strong alternative to traditional polling, which often misses subtle shifts in voter sentiment. Developed from a study of presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model aimed to cut through polling noise and focus on the broader factors that shape elections. The model’s 13 true/false questions support or oppose the incumbent’s chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include economic stability, absence of scandals, and whether the challenger is charismatic.Below are some key indicators that Lichtman considered crucial:Party Mandate – Incumbents often gain an advantage if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates party unity, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows steady growth, it generally supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment benefits the incumbent.No Scandal – Absence of scandals maintains public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This benefits the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.In 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris had eight keys in her favour, indicating a Democratic win. However, the result suggests that underlying political and social dynamics were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now a reality, Lichtman’s rare error may highlight how shifting political dynamics affect the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly present unexpected factors, like disinformation, polarisation, and changing voter loyalty. While historically insightful, Lichtman’s model may face challenges in adapting to the electorate’s evolving motivations.Additionally, the 2024 election was marked by heightened emotion and intense division across party lines. Trump’s divisive but impactful rhetoric appealed to many voters disillusioned with the status quo. Although Harris appeared to have the advantage, voter sentiment ultimately leaned towards a familiar figure promising change, despite his controversial approach.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His comments on democracy’s precarious state underscore a broader concern: that American democracy, like others worldwide, is under strain. Rising polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and the spread of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman worries these trends could destabilise democracy if left unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards democratic values. He urged vigilance, reminding those who value democracy not to lose hope. While democracy is fragile, it can also be resilient—if people remain committed to protecting it.In uncertain times, Lichtman’s insights remind us that no model is infallible, but the continued pursuit of truth, transparency, and democratic values is essential. As he concluded, “Never give up hope.” This sentiment transcends his prediction, offering a hopeful message to those committed to upholding democracy in an unpredictable world.","Allan Lichtman, often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk.

What Harry wrote about 'The Wasp'



Hary will have to publicly apologize...



The person who was believed to have blocked all attempts of Prince Harry to reconcile with his father and brother is contemplating retiring and that according to royal experts is indeed good news for Harry. Though he is only 57, Clive Alderton , King Charles' all-powerful private secretary and gatekeeper, is considering retirement, royal expert Tine Brown said.Brown wrote that Harry and Alderton had a personal enmity and that dominated Alderton's advice to King Charles to not welcome Harry back to the royal fold. The replacement of Alderton by a figure without any personal animosity with Harry could ""create a new, friendlier path for negotiations with Harry"".In his memoir Spare, Harry christened Alderton as ""The Wasp"" -- such is the extent of their enmity.According to reports, Harry has been trying to reconcile with his ailing father but no meeting could have been arranged between the two and experts blame Alderton for that.“Despite the passing of years, there is still a gaping Harry-shaped hole in the depleted royal line-up. As a veteran of two military tours in Afghanistan and founder of Invictus, the substantive charity that brings hope through competitive sports events for injured vets, the Duke of Sussex, now stripped of his military honors, surely deserved a place on the balcony. The British nation needs his human touch and so does his ailing father,"" Brown wrote.Harry wrote The Wasp was ""lanky, charming, arrogant, a ball of jazzy energy"". ""He was great at pretending to be polite, even servile. You'd assert a fact, something seemingly incontrovertible—'I believe the sun rises in the mornings'—and he'd stammer that perchance you might consider for a moment the possibility that you'd been misinformed: 'Well, heh-heh, I don't know about that, Your Royal Highness, you see, it all depends what you mean by mornings, sir.' Because he seemed so weedy, so self-effacing, you might be tempted to push back, insist on your point, and that was when he'd put you on his list.A short time later, without warning, he'd give you such a stab with his outsized stinger that you'd cry out in confusion. Where the f*** did that come from?"" Harry wrote.Prince William wants Harry to publicly apologize for the hurtful comments he made after stepping down as a senior working Royal in 2020. Harry would also likely have to drop his lawsuit against the British government for stripping him of taxpayer-funded bodyguards. On the flip side, Harry and Meghan, if taken back to the royal fold again, could be put to good use on overseas tours which kind of became embarrassments for the royals.","Clive Alderton, King Charles' all-powerful private secretary and gatekeeper, is considering retirement, royal expert Tine Brown said.

President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named his ""highly effective communicator"" and campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt as his White House press secretary .""Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,"" Trump said, adding, ""I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.""Leavitt is the youngest White House press secretary, surpassing the previous record set by Ron Ziegler, who was 29 when President Nixon appointed him in 1969.The 27-year-old's appointment comes as a full circle from serving as an assistant press secretary in Donald Trump's first term to becoming one in the second term.Leavitt is a New Hampshire native who has previously served as assistant press secretary during Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021.After Trump’s 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, Leavitt served as communications director for Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick for UN ambassador.In 2022, she ran for a New Hampshire House seat, winning the Republican primary before ultimately losing to Democrat Chris Pappas—but the experience sharpened her public speaking skills.Leavitt then returned to Trump’s orbit, leading communications for his 2024 campaign and transition team.

""From a bygone era""

LONDON: On the last day of January, a woman took her son to see paediatrician Nadezhda Buyanova at Polyclinic No. 140 in northwest Moscow. The boy, aged seven, had a problem with one of his eyes.The conversation that the boy's mother alleged took place during an 18-minute encounter at the clinic would change both women's lives and land the 68-year-old doctor in prison.The case hinged on a denunciation - part of a rising trend of Russians informing on fellow citizens for their views on the war in Ukraine and other alleged political crimes. Critics say the wave of denunciations is helping President Vladimir Putin 's government crack down on dissent.In a video recorded as she was walking away from the clinic, the mother, Anastasia Akinshina, said she had told the doctor the boy was traumatised because his father was killed fighting for Russia in the war in Ukraine.""Do you know what she told me? 'Well, my dear, what do you expect? Your husband was a legitimate target of Ukraine,'"" Akinshina said, mimicking the doctor's voice and intonation.Fighting back tears, Akinshina said she had raised the incident with the hospital administration and suspected they planned to hush it up.""So the question is: where can I complain about this bitch now, so that she'll be kicked out of the fucking country or sent to the devil in jail?"" she said in the video, which went viral on social media and thrust her into a high-profile criminal trial as the key prosecution witness.At the trial, Buyanova denied making the comment. But despite a lack of further adult witnesses, the denunciation was sufficient to destroy her 40-year medical career and her life.The doctor, who had been in pre-trial detention since April, appeared before a Moscow court on Tuesday, her grey hair closely cropped. She was found guilty under a wartime censorship law of ""publicly spreading deliberately false information"" about the armed forces and sentenced to five-and-a-half years in a penal colony.Buyanova was born in Ukraine but is a citizen of Russia, where she has lived and worked for three decades. Her lawyer Oscar Cherdzhiyev told Reuters the defence believed Akinshina acted out of malice because of the doctor's Ukrainian origins.Akinshina did not respond to written questions for this story, or answer her phone.At the trial, she stated: ""We are Russian. Buyanova hates Russians. She feels hostility towards me, that's what I think,"" according to a transcript by independent Russian outlet Mediazona.Two hospital staff who saw Akinshina after the consultation with Buyanova described her in evidence as being distraught.The prosecution's case was based almost entirely on Akinshina's account, along with a transcript read out in the trial of an interview with the child, conducted by an officer of the FSB security service. At first, Akinshina said the boy was not in the room when the comments were made, but later changed her story, telling the court she originally spoke in a state of shock.The judge rejected the defence's request to put its own questions to the child.Russian rights group OVD-Info has recorded 21 criminal prosecutions in politically-motivated cases based on denunciations since the launch of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Eva Levenberg, a lawyer with the group, told Reuters.Levenberg, who lives in Germany, said OVD-Info knew of a further 175 people who had faced lower-level administrative charges for ""discrediting"" the Russian army as a result of people informing on them in the same period, and 79 of these had been fined.Reuters was unable to independently confirm the numbers Levenberg provided.Russia's Justice Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the data or the use of denunciations to support prosecutions, including in the Buyanova case. In response to a question posed by Reuters, Putin 's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin does not comment on court rulings.Putin has said the country is in a proxy war with the West, and citizens need to help root out internal enemies. In March 2022, weeks after the invasion, he declared that the Russian people ""will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths.""Since the start of the Ukraine war, according to OVD-Info, the authorities have detained more than 20,000 people for various forms of anti-war statements or protests, and launched criminal cases against 1,094 individuals.In news reports, court cases and on social media, examples have come to light of neighbour informing on neighbour, churchgoers denouncing priests and students reporting on teachers.For some, the resulting current climate is reminiscent of the atmosphere of mutual distrust and suspicion under Soviet Communist rule.Olga Podolskaya is a former municipal deputy for the Tula region, south of Moscow, who by her own account earned a ""pesky"" reputation as an independent local politician prepared to stand up to the authorities. In the first hours after the Ukraine invasion, she added her signature to an open letter describing it as ""an unprecedented atrocity"" and urging citizens to speak out against it.Four months later, she was the subject of a public denunciation that asked for her finances to be investigated after she collected public donations to pay off a fine related to a protest in 2020. The denunciation was filed under the name ""Olga Minenkova"", but Podolskaya said no such person was ever identified, and she suspects the identity was a fake one. Reuters has seen a copy of the denunciation, but could not establish who filed it.Further public accusations followed, against her and her husband. Asked how she felt at the time, Podolskaya said it made her think of her great-grandfather, executed under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1938 after someone informed against him.""The time of denunciations and 'enemies of the people' had returned. I realised that they were hinting I should leave the country,"" said Podolskaya.She left, in April 2023. In September that year she was placed on the Ministry of Justice's public ""foreign agent"" list. To protect her security, she asked Reuters not to disclose where she is based now.Doctor Andrei Prokofiev was targeted in 2023 by a prolific informer called Anna Korobkova who wrote to his employer demanding he be fired for anti-war comments he made to a foreign news outlet.Korobkova did not reply to a request for comment.In a letter last year to Alexandra Arkhipova, a sociologist who was the target of one of her denunciations, Korobkova said informing was ""in her blood"" as her grandfather had worked with Stalin's NKVD secret police. Arkhipova posted the letter on Telegram.Korobkova said she sent 764 denunciations to government agencies in the first year of the war alone, focusing on Russians who speak to foreign media. She likened her work to ""using submarines to destroy enemy ships"".Reuters was unable to confirm the extent or impact of her activity.Prokofiev told Reuters he suffered no repercussions, as he lives in Germany. But he fears going back to Russia: ""I don't think I would make it out of the airport. They would start a criminal case right away.""Prokofiev took a particular interest in Buyanova's case because, when he lived in Russia, his son was one of her patients. He describes her as a quiet, modest person - ""an elderly figure from a bygone era"" who tapped awkwardly with just one or two fingers on her computer.There has been some pushback against her trial. Prokofiev was among a total of 1,035 doctors who declared solidarity with Buyanova in an open letter, warning the case would put young people off entering medicine. Some of the doctors appeared in their scrubs speaking out in a video compilation posted on Facebook.Alexander Polupan, the doctor behind the Buyanova initiative as well as letters in support of dissidents including the late Alexei Navalny, said at least seven medics were questioned by police after signing them. Reuters could not verify those interrogations, and the Russian interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Polupan himself left Russia last year, ""when it became clear I would be arrested any day"", he told Reuters.Rachel Denber, Deputy Director of the Europe and Central Asian Division of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said prosecuting an older defendant from a respected profession sent a signal that nobody can afford to defy the official line on Ukraine.Even if Buyanova had said that Russian soldiers on the battlefield were legitimate targets for Ukraine, the assertion would be correct under international law, Denber said.""That is the Geneva Conventions,"" she added.International law governing war allows for the use of lethal force against clearly identified enemy combatants in certain situations.At the trial, prosecutors gave details of messages and images on Buyanova's mobile phone that did not relate to the dispute with Akinshina but were used to present a picture of someone with pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian views.The defence said someone else had used the device and the messages weren't hers.In her final speech at the summing-up, the doctor was tearful. She asked the court to take into account her age, fragile health and decades of service.Supporters in tee-shirts printed with Buyanova's unassuming image shouted ""shame"" at the sentencing.Before the verdict was read, Buyanova expressed shock at what was happening.""I can't get my head around it,"" she told reporters. ""Maybe I will later.""","Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, sentenced to five-and-a-half years in a penal colony. Case hinged on a denunciation - part of a rising trend of Russians informing on fellow citizens for their views on the war in Ukraine. Critics say the wave of denunciations is helping President Vladimir Putin's government crack down on dissent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115349168,imgsize-1004434,width-400,resizemode-4/115349168.jpg"

One of the Iranian officials said that it was Musk who had requested the meeting and that the ambassador picked the site.During his first term Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers and imposed tough economic sanctions on Iranian oil revenues and international banking transactions. He also ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani, in Iraq in 2020. In response, Iran's supreme leader banned any negotiations with the Trump govt and Iranian officials vowed to avenge Suleimani's killing.

Why is Donald Trump's pick for Pentagon Pete Hegseth labelled as ‘insider threat’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-donald-trumps-pick-for-pentagon-pete-hegseth-labelled-as-insider-threat/articleshow/115349804.cms,"Why is 'Deus Vult' associated with white supremacist and far-right groups



NEW DELHI: Pete Hegseth , the Army National Guard veteran and Fox News host picked by US president-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Defense, was flagged as a potential “Insider Threat” by a fellow service member.Hegseth’s tattoo of the phrase “Deus Vult,” linked to white supremacist groups, raised concerns about extremist affiliations within the military ranks.Accordint to associated press a fellow Guard member who was the unit’s security manager and on an anti-terrorism team at the time, shared an email he sent to the unit’s leadership flagging a different tattoo reading “Deus Vult” that’s been used by white supremacists, concerned it was an indication of an “Insider Threat.”Hegseth has argued that he was unfairly targeted, asserting that the tattoo’s symbolism was misinterpreted. He has also criticised the Pentagon ’s efforts to tackle extremism within the military, saying such steps reflect a baseless, exaggerated issue.Since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Hegseth has downplayed both the violence and the involvement of military-trained individuals, stating on a Fox News panel that the crowd were “people who love our country” and who “love freedom.”However, the Pentagon responded with alarm as individuals in tactical gear moved in military-style formations on the Capitol steps. Among those facing the most serious charges from the insurrection, eight of the 14 convicted for seditious conspiracy had prior military service. More than 20 of the military-related individuals arrested were actively serving at the time, according to data from the University of Maryland’s START consortium.In his recent book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth maintained that only “a handful” of active-duty soldiers and reservists were present at the Capitol that day, ignoring the larger number of military veterans involved in the insurrection. He has described the Pentagon’s counter-extremism efforts as “fake” and “manufactured,” asserting it has pushed “rank-and-file patriots out of their formations.”Hegseth’s potential leadership could introduce a stark contrast at the Department of Defense. He would oversee an institution committed to tackling extremist influence within its ranks while continuing to claim that the issue is overblown and used to “peddle the lie of racism in the military.”The phrase ""Deus Vult,"" meaning ""God wills it"" in Latin, originated during the First Crusade in 1095 as a rallying cry for Christian soldiers who aimed to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim rule. The phrase historically conveyed a sense of divine mission or purpose, but in modern times, it has been adopted by some white supremacist and far-right groups, who use it as a symbol of a perceived clash between ""Western"" (Christian) and ""Eastern"" (Islamic) cultures.White supremacist groups have co-opted ""Deus Vult"" to evoke the imagery of the Crusades as a justification for racist and xenophobic ideologies, portraying their cause as a similar battle to ""protect"" Western civilization. This modern usage distorts the original context of the phrase, turning it into a slogan for exclusionary, extremist beliefs.This association has made ""Deus Vult"" a contentious phrase in online spaces, especially in communities working to identify and counter hate speech, where it’s recognized as a dog whistle for far-right extremism.Also read: 'Democrats think this is Swastika': Row over chest tattoo of Trump's secretary of defense Pete Hegseth","Pete Hegseth was flagged as a potential “Insider Threat” by a fellow service member.

A powerful car bomb accidentally detonated early Thursday in a house in Mir Ali, a former Pakistani Taliban stronghold in northwest Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing at least two children and five suspected militants, according to news agency AP.The explosion occurred before dawn while militant commander Rasool Jan was preparing the bomb in his home, said local police official Irfan Khan. Following the blast, Pakistani Taliban members quickly arrived at the site and retrieved the bodies of the deceased insurgents. Authorities later recovered the bodies of two children from the collapsed house, which was destroyed by the impact.The blast also caused extensive damage to nearby homes and injured 14 individuals, including women. Some of the injured are in critical condition at a hospital, although further details were not provided.Police believe the car bomb was intended for an attack in the region, where Pakistani Taliban and other militants frequently target security forces using firearms, rockets, grenades, and suicide bombings.In a separate incident the same day, a suicide bomber on a motorcycle accidentally triggered an explosive device on a deserted road in Charsadda district, killing himself without injuring anyone else, according to local authorities. Local official Masood Khan stated that investigators were assessing whether the bomber was carrying the explosives or if they were attached to his motorcycle, and the intended target remains unclear.The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , operate independently from the Afghan Taliban, though they have been emboldened by the latter’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.","A powerful car bomb accidentally detonated early Thursday in a house in northwest Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing at least two children and five suspected militants.

China pushing to deploy its own security staff to protect citizens in Pak: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/china-pushing-to-deploy-its-own-security-staff-to-protect-citizens-in-pak-report/articleshow/115235972.cms,"File photo

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

Pakistan faces VPN restrictions after PM Sharif's tweet congratulating Trump gets community note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-faces-vpn-restrictions-after-pm-sharifs-tweet-congratulating-trump-gets-community-note/articleshow/115164269.cms,"Pakistan PM congratulates Trump

Internet users in Pakistan reported significant disruptions to Virtual Private Network (VPN) services over the weekend, with reports of “restricted access” and “throttled connectivity” affecting popular VPN providers, Dawn reported. This surge in access issues comes just days after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated former US President Donald Trump on social media platform X, a post which attracted scrutiny and sparked debate online.An outage-tracking website, issues were reported on VPN services such as VPN Unlimited and TunnelBear, Dawn reported quoting Downdetector. Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns. This recent wave of connectivity issues has reignited discussions over digital freedom and government policies limiting online access.Prime Minister Sharif's recent tweet congratulating Trump for his second term win garnered significant attention for both its content and the reaction it received. In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations. Critics view these measures as an infringement on digital rights, arguing that the restrictions stifle free expression and access to information.",Internet users in Pakistan reported disruptions to Virtual Private Network (VPN) services over the weekend.
