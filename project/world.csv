Startled, the child began crying but his parents were relieved to find no visible injuries or scratches.However, their relief turned into concern when the child developed high fever later that day. When the fever persisted for more than 24 hours, the child was taken to Bangalore Baptist Hospital , Hebbal.""At Baptist Hospital, the doctor initially suspected an internal injury and advised us to keep monitoring him,"" the father told TOI. ""As a precaution, they ran some tests on Jan 2.""The results, which came back on Jan 3, left the family shocked and confused. ""The doctors said our son had tested positive for HMPV, but he appeared perfectly normal. We didn't understand how he could have contracted the virus, especially when our initial concern was just a simple fall,"" the father said. ""We feel helpless. It doesn't make sense how he went from falling off a bed to being diagnosed with a virus,"" he said. ""The hospital insists he couldn't have caught it there, but now we're left dealing with this situation.""The parents are also frustrated with the unexpected attention their child's case has garnered. ""Instead of answers, all we have is confusion, and now people keep bringing it up.

Financial burden and emotional stress are said to have forced the couple to take the extreme step.Preliminary investigation suggested Anup Kumar and Rakhi (35) poisoned their five-year-old autistic daughter Anupriya and two-year-old son Priyansh, before hanging themselves. The family was from Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and was staying in a rented house in Sadashivanagar.On Monday, when a woman employed by the couple to take care of the children came for work, she discovered Anup hanging and raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed in and found the others dead in another room. The woman, Reshma, told police she was asked to come a little early as the family had planned to leave for Puducherry. Police checked Kumar's laptop and mobile phone and found that he had sent an email around midnight to his elder brother Amit.Based on the contents of the mail and the statements of those known to the family, police said Anup's financial troubles began after his maternal uncle Rakesh lured him into investing around Rs 25 lakh on a piece of land in Prayagraj to start a petrol bunk in 2018. The business remained a non-starter and his hard-earned money was stuck.After Anupriya was admitted to a pre-school, the couple got their daughter's medical examination done on teachers' insistence. The results suggested she was autistic. Most of Anup's salary was spent on daughter's treatment. The financial strain took a toll on his mental health.

This comes amid speculation of the govt earmarking a site for former PM Manmohan Singh's memorial very soon. Singh's family is likely to visit sites shortlisted by the govt at Smriti Sthal and adjoining areas in the Raj Ghat precinct soon, sources said.Earmarking of the site for Mukherjee's memorial was made public by the late President's daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee in a tweet on Tuesday after meeting PM Modi. The land and development office (L&DO) under the housing and urban affairs ministry earmarked the site on Jan 1. Sources said as per norms, the site will be allotted to a trust after it is set up.The order said, ""The competent authority has approved earmarking of a designated site within 'Rashtriya Smriti' complex (a part of Raj Ghat precinct) for erecting a samadhi of late Pranab Mukherjee, former President.""In a post on X, Pranab's daughter Sharmistha said, ""Called on PM Narendra Modi to express thanks and gratitude from the core of my heart for his govt's decision to create a memorial for baba.

The hero of the day is 43-year-old Yoganand. The act of him catching the wild cat by its tail left social media platforms buzzing.The drama unfolded when villagers spotted a leopard near the agricultural fields. The spotted cat had by then devoured some livestock from surrounding villages.The forest department was notified. Within minutes, a 15-member team came to the village with a cage, looking for fresh pugmarks near the paddy fields. A few locals, including Yoganand, joined the search, while some curious women and children stood at a distance. ""While the pugmarks could be seen all over the fields, we could not spot the animal. After placing the cage, we started fanning out in teams by holding nets,"" a forest officer said.As the search intensified, the leopard suddenly leapt out of a bush - a few metres from where the officers had just passed by. ""Everyone screamed and jumped away. At the same time, we threw the nets on it twice, but the leopard slipped free each time,"" the officer added. What sent shivers down everyone's spine was when the animal headed straight towards the women and children. That is when Yoganand got into action. He lunged at the leopard and yanked it by its tail.Yoganand said: ""I realized the women and children were in danger. The leopard could attack the crowd and someone would get injured. In retaliation, villagers could target the leopard. Also, I saw the leopard was moving slowly, as if it had some health issues.

An uncomfortable moment at the swearing-in ceremony of US Senators on Friday quickly became the center of controversy when Bruce Fisher , the husband of Republican Senator Deb Fischer, appeared to refuse a handshake from Vice President Kamala Harris . A video capturing the incident has gone viral, sparking intense debate across social media platforms.In the footage, Fisher , holding a cane in one hand and a Bible in the other, stands rigidly beside his wife as Harris approaches after administering the oath of office. A slight nudge from Deb Fischer subtly encourages her husband to move closer to Harris . Responding with good humor, the Vice President, smiling, said, “It’s okay, I won’t bite. Don’t worry,” attempting to ease any tension.Fisher, while flashing a brief smile, made no attempt to engage further. When Harris extended her hand for a handshake after the ceremony, Fisher seemingly declined. Instead of shaking hands, he offered a curt ""thank you"" and placed his other hand in his pocket. The awkward moment was highlighted by Harris's raised eyebrow, which caught the attention of onlookers.The incident quickly ignited a wave of reactions online, with many liberal commentators criticizing Fisher for what they perceived as a snub of the Vice President. Liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen condemned the gesture, writing on X (formerly Twitter), “The husband of a Republican senator just refused to shake hands or make eye contact with Vice President Harris. The level of class you can expect from MAGA.”Author Don Winslow went even further, calling Fisher’s behavior “disgraceful” and accusing him of lacking basic decency. “He cannot muster a few seconds of class to shake the hands of @VP Kamala Harris,” Winslow said. “Pigs don’t only live on farms. He is a pig.”Radio host Roland Martin also weighed in, criticizing the refusal to even make eye contact with Harris. ""In the FULL video, he didn’t even want to stand next to her! Stop making excuses. He QUICKLY put his hand in his pocket so as not to touch her,"" Martin remarked.On the other side of the aisle, Republicans defended Fisher’s actions, citing that he was simply holding a cane, which made it difficult for him to shake hands. Some suggested that the incident was being blown out of proportion, pointing out that there was no ill intent.Despite the varying interpretations of the incident, one thing is clear: the moment has sparked heated discussions about civility, politics, and the often complex dynamics of political gestures. Whether seen as a simple misunderstanding or a deliberate snub, the video has captured widespread attention and continued to dominate social media.","Bruce Fisher, the husband of Republican Senator Deb Fischer, appeared to refuse a handshake from Vice President Kamala Harris.

How the crime allegedly unfolded

A court in southwestern Germany on Tuesday heard a couple's confession to the killing of a 27-year-old Ukrainian and her 51-year-old mother because they wanted to take the younger woman's baby.The two defendants planned to kidnap the newborn girl and pass her off as their own after suffering a number of miscarriages and failed fertility treatments, the court heard.The Mannheim District Court was told that Ukrainian refugees were living in refugee accommodation in the southwestern German town of Wiesloch when the young mother came into contact with the couple.The couple had intentionally targeted refugees from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, having joined a group on the Telegram messaging app to offer help with translation.According to the public prosecutor's office, the background to the crime was an unfulfilled desire to have a daughter between them.The indictment says the 43-year-old and the 44-year-old had long wanted a daughter together. The pair already had four children in total, including a son they had together.When the Ukrainian woman's child was born in February 2024, prosecutors said the couple decided to kill both her and her mother.The suspects did not appear in person at the initial opening.""I regret everything I have done,"" the man said in a statement that was read out by lawyers. ""We really wanted to have a daughter together, that was my wife's most fervent wish.""His wife added, ""I made a big mistake.""At the beginning of March, the court was told the couple went to a restaurant with the two women and secretly gave them sedative medication.The prosecutor's office said the 51-year-old then felt unwell and the couple pretended to want to take her to the hospital.Instead, they drove the older woman, who was suffering from impaired consciousness, to a lake where the man killed her by hitting her several times on the head before throwing her body into the lake.The couple was said to have told the young woman that her mother had suffered a heart attack and to have then driven to a dam in Hockenheim with the young woman and the baby.There, the man allegedly killed the new mother, who was also suffering from a loss of consciousness due to the medication, again by hitting her on the head. They then set fire to the body and took the baby home.The younger victim's remains were found shortly afterward while her mother's body was discovered by police divers two weeks later.The baby was found unharmed with the couple and the couple were taken into custody. They are accused of joint murder in two cases and the abduction of a minor.The court has scheduled nine days of hearings until the end of February.","A court in southwestern Germany hears a couple's confession to the killing of a 27-year-old Ukrainian and her mother.

Panama uneasy over Trump’s threat to take control of canal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panama-uneasy-over-trumps-threat-to-take-control-of-canal/articleshow/117038249.cms,"AP photo

President-elect Donald Trump 's suggestion on Tuesday that the United States might reclaim the Panama Canal, even through the use of force, has caused unease in Panama.Panama's foreign minister, Javier Martínez-Acha, made his country's position clear at a news conference hours after the American president-elect mused aloud about retaking the canal.""The sovereignty of our canal is nonnegotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest,"" Martínez-Acha said. ""Let it be clear: The canal belongs to the Panamanians, and it will continue to be that way.""According to a New York Times report, experts believe Trump’s comments are more about exerting pressure than a genuine threat. They suggest his goal may be to secure preferential treatment for US ships using the canal or to push Panama to curb migration through the Darién Gap, a critical route for migrants heading toward the US.Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino has already worked closely with the US on migration issues, approving a US-supported programme to reduce illegal crossings through the Darién region.Panamanians’ memories of past US military actions, including the 1989 invasion to depose Manuel Noriega, remain vivid, reigniting concerns.A small country with more than 4 million inhabitants and no active military, as per its constitution, Panama would be in no position to stave off the U.S. military.In recent weeks, as he prepares to take office, Trump has talked repeatedly about not just taking over the Panama Canal, control of which the United States ceded to Panama by treaty in the late 1990s, but also buying Greenland from Denmark.","Donald Trump has suggested that the U.S. might reclaim the Panama Canal, even through the use of force.

""You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like,"" Trump said, adding that such a merger would improve national security, given that the US already protects Canada.Trudeau, however responded on X, ""There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.""He also pointed to the strong bilateral ties between the two nations, noting that trade and security cooperation are essential to both countries' prosperity.

However, his use of AI tools to gather information for the attack marks a troubling first.Las Vegas metropolitan police department Sheriff Kevin McMahill described the use of generative AI in the attack as a ""game-changer”.""This is the first incident that I’m aware of on US soil where ChatGPT was utilised to help an individual build a particular device,"" McMahill said during a press conference.An investigation into Livelsberger’s ChatGPT search history revealed that he had sought information on explosive targets, ammunition speed, and the legality of fireworks in Arizona.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, responded to the incident in a statement, asserting its commitment to responsible AI use. “ChatGPT provided only publicly available information and warned against harmful or illegal activities. We are cooperating with law enforcement to support their investigation,” the statement read.Livelsberger’s writings and actions suggest the explosion was intended as a dramatic “wake-up call” for what he perceived as the nation’s societal and political troubles. A journal titled “Surveillance Log”, recovered by investigators, showed he believed he was under law enforcement surveillance despite having no criminal record or FBI tracking. In his notes, he expressed concerns about being labeled a terrorist and insisted he had no intention of causing harm to others.During his drive to Las Vegas, Livelsberger stopped to refuel the Cybertruck with racing-grade fuel, which later dripped from the vehicle. The truck, laden with 60 pounds of pyrotechnic material and 70 pounds of birdshot, exploded after a flash believed to be the firearm he used to end his life ignited the fuel vapor.Seven individuals sustained minor injuries in the blast, but the Trump hotel suffered virtually no damage.Law enforcement also disclosed the existence of a six-page document in Livelsberger’s possession, which has not been made public as it may contain classified material. Investigators are still reviewing a laptop, smartphone, and smartwatch found at the scene.Livelsberger had reportedly considered alternative targets, including the Grand Canyon’s glass skywalk, but changed his plans for reasons yet unknown. His letters reflected deep political and societal grievances, touching on issues such as the war in Ukraine and the perceived decline of the United States.In one note, Livelsberger urged Americans to “rally around” President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, emphasising that he bore no ill will toward Trump. Instead, he described his act as a means to “cleanse” his mind of the burdens of war and the lives he had taken.","Las Vegas police disclosed that Matthew Livelsberger had used generative AI, including ChatGPT, in planning criminal acts.

Aftershocks and historical seismic activity

A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the remote Tibetan plateau near the Nepal border on Tuesday, leaving at least 126 dead and over 180 injured in its wake, news agency AFP reported. The tremor, which hit Tingri County in Tibet's Xigaze City , caused buildings to collapse, roads to fracture, and sent goods tumbling off supermarket shelves, sparking panic across the region. Dozens of aftershocks followed, further complicating rescue operations.Footage captured in Shigatse showed shoppers fleeing as goods toppled, while rescue workers scoured mounds of debris in a desperate hunt for survivors. China’s ministry of emergency management confirmed at least 1,000 homes were damaged, leaving streets littered with rubble and cars crushed under fallen debris.The earthquake struck at 9.05 am local time, at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). Its epicentre was in Tingri County, a sparsely populated area with just under 7,000 residents across 27 villages. Reports indicate significant damage to infrastructure, with authorities deploying over 3,000 rescuers and activating emergency relief measures.As rescue operations continue, the death toll stands at 126, with more than 180 injured. Many remain trapped under rubble, while freezing temperatures and ongoing aftershocks complicate rescue efforts. Shigatse, one of Tibet's holiest cities, suffered significant damage, reminiscent of its plight during the 2015 Nepal earthquake Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “all-out efforts” to rescue trapped residents, minimise casualties, and secure shelter for displaced families. The central government dispatched 22,000 disaster relief items, including winter supplies like tents and quilts, to the region, which experiences harsh winters at altitudes exceeding 4,000 metres.In Nepal, the tremors were strongly felt in the capital, Kathmandu, 230 kilometres away, and other northern districts, forcing residents to flee to open spaces. Though no fatalities were reported in Nepal, minor damage to buildings was recorded, particularly in high-altitude areas like Solukhumbu near Mount Everest.Approximately 50 aftershocks were recorded within hours, with magnitudes reaching up to 4.5. The Tibetan plateau, situated at the collision zone of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, is highly prone to earthquakes. Past disasters in the region include the devastating 2015 earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people in Nepal and caused significant damage in Tibet.Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama expressed condolences, saying he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life and destruction. Meanwhile, the Chinese military deployed drones and air support to assess the disaster zone, with Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing overseeing relief efforts on-site.","A magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit Tibet on Tuesday, causing severe damage in Tingri County.

The bigger picture

In a candid interview with LBC’s Tom Swarbrick, Errol Musk , father of billionaire Elon Musk, had a simple message for critics: stop listening to his son’s tweets. Errol’s remarks come after Elon Musk waded into UK politics , accusing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of failing to tackle grooming gangs during his tenure as Director of Public Prosecutions—a claim that drew sharp rebukes from British leaders.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer wasn’t holding back, calling Elon “desperate for attention” and accusing him of spreading lies and “whipping up intimidation.” Starmer said online attacks, particularly those aimed at safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, crossed a line.Errol, however, seemed unimpressed by his son’s foray into British political discourse. “He’s just a person,” he said. “The fact that he has money or something, he’s a billionaire or something to that effect... Tell him to get lost.”But the elder Musk wasn’t all criticism. He defended Elon’s interest in the UK, citing a deep familial connection to England. “I took him there when he was six. He even celebrated his 30th birthday in England by renting a castle for a week,” he reminisced.Despite his affection for the UK, Errol Musk warned of a “draconian” trend in British politics, adding, “If you’re a student of history, and I am, you’d realise what’s going on there.”Meanwhile, Starmer slammed Musk’s online behavior, particularly his support for jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Starmer said such figures aren’t interested in justice, accusing Robinson and his supporters of promoting street violence rather than protecting victims.Starmer praised Jess Phillips’ dedication to safeguarding victims of sexual abuse, saying, “Jess has done a thousand times more than they’ve even dreamt about.”Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted progress in tackling child sexual exploitation , noting a 25% increase in arrests made by a police taskforce last year. She credited the Conservative government’s efforts, particularly through advanced analytics programs targeting organized exploitation networks.Labour MP Paul Waugh added a sobering note, condemning those who have treated child rape as a “political game” rather than an “appalling crime.”As the political sparring continues, one thing is clear: Elon Musk’s tweets have stirred the pot in UK politics, much to the chagrin—and occasional amusement—of his father.","Errol Musk, father of billionaire Elon Musk, had a simple message for critics: stop listening to his son’s tweets. “The fact that he has money or something, he's a billionaire or something to that effect...

Make America Great Again isn't just a political or economic slogan. Contours of a ""Greater America,"" a geographical and cartographic entity began to take shape on Monday, at least in the public sphere, after US President-elect Donald Trump in all seriousness urged Canada to merge with the United States and renewed the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark.As if to demonstrate he is not joking or trolling, Trump also revealed that his son Don Jr will be traveling to Greenland on Tuesday.

We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World,"" he posted on his social media platform.In a separate post, he also invited Canada to merge with the United States, saying if it did so, ""there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them.""""Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat.

Trump declared, while also invoking MAGA in the case of Greenland in a message that read ""I am hearing that the people of Greenland are “MAGA”... MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!""A geographical entity that adds Canada and Greenland to the United States would create a Northern Hemispheric nation of nearly 22 million square kilometers larger than Russia, which it would face across the Arctic north pole. Russia is currently the world's largest country of approximately 17 million sq km.Trump's MAGA acolytes talked up the idea, including posting videos of a Greenlander disgruntled with the territory's current affiliation with Denmark and wanting Washington to buy out Greenland. “The people of Greenland should decide their future and I think they want to be part of America!” Trump surrogate Elon Musk said on X, formerly Twitter.But leaders in both Greenland and Canada scoffed at the proposal. Greenland is “not for sale and will never be for sale,” Prime Minister Múte Egede, the territory's prime minister said, despite his stand of pressing for independence from Denmark. Aaja Chemnitz, another Greenlandic politician, expressed disbelief that there are people who “believe that happiness will be achieved if we become American citizens.”Canadians too have pushed back at the idea. Even Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada’s Conservative party more aligned with Trump Republicans, said last week that his message to incoming President Trump is that ""first and foremost Canada will never be the 51st state of the U.S.""While Trump's stab at folding Canada into the United States is a relatively new idea, his bid to buy Greenland first surfaced during his first term when he is said to have commissioned a feasibility study. According to accounts in the book “The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,” members of his team, including then National Security Adviser John Bolton and his aide Fiona Hill, engaged in secret talks with Denmark and produced an options memo that included ideas like an enhanced security arrangement but not outright purchase or leasing that Trump was keen on.","US President-elect Donald Trump in all seriousness urged Canada to merge with the United States and renewed the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark.

A swipe at Mexico and tariff threats

Trudeau’s resignation sparks merger talk

Historic waters, bold claims

In a statement as audacious as it was provocative, President-elect Donald Trump declared on Tuesday his intention to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” The announcement, accompanied by criticisms of Mexico’s trade and immigration policies, has already stirred controversy on both sides of the border.“We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,” Trump told reporters. “What a beautiful name. And it’s appropriate. It’s appropriate. Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country.”Trump asserted that the US does “most of the work there” and claimed the gulf “belongs” to America. The Republican leader added that an official announcement would come “at a future date pretty soon.”The comments were part of Trump’s broader critique of Mexico, which he labeled “a very dangerous place, essentially run by the cartels.” He also reiterated his long-standing grievances about the US’s trade deficit with both Mexico and Canada, threatening to impose steep tariffs on both countries.“And we’re going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada ,” Trump said, accusing Canada of being a drug trafficking route. “The drugs that are coming through are at record numbers.”Trump’s remarks didn’t stop with Mexico. He floated the idea of a US-Canada merger following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation on Monday. “Canada... they come through Canada too,” he said, alluding to drug routes, before suggesting a potential unification of the two nations.The Gulf of Mexico, a body of water spanning over half a million square miles, has been recognized on European maps since the 1500s. Trump’s proposal to rename it has sparked criticism from historians and foreign policy experts, who note that such a move would likely face significant international backlash.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo and outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have both spoken with Trump about his tariff threats in recent months. Neither leader has commented on the proposed renaming or merger suggestion, but political analysts predict that Trump’s statements could further strain North American relations .With his inauguration just weeks away, Trump’s comments have set the stage for a contentious start to his administration.","US President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” He also threatened to impose steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada.

US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced his bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"" ""pretty soon"" after he takes charge in the Oval office.“We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,” Trump said.“What a beautiful name. And it’s appropriate. It’s appropriate. Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country,” he added.Trump asserted that the US does “most of the work there” and claimed the gulf “belongs” to America. The Republican leader added that an official announcement would come “at a future date pretty soon.”Soon after Trump's remarks, Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Green said in an Interview with a podcast that she would direct her staff to draft legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Green said that she would take care of funding for new maps and administrative policy materials throughout the federal government.Meanwhile, changing names of international waterbodies is not a unilateral decision and countries might not go along.The International Hydrographic Organisation works to ensure all the world's seas, oceans and navigable waters are surveyed and charted uniformly, and also names sone of them. There are instances where countries refer to the same body of water or landmark by different names in their own documentation.It can be easier when a landmark or body of water is within a country's boundaries. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama approved an order from the Department of Interior to rename Mount McKinley — the highest peak in North America — to Denali, a move that Trump has also said he wants to reverse.There's a long-running dispute over the name of the Sea of Japan among Japan, North Korea, South Korea and Russia.South Korea claims that the current name wasn't commonly used until Korea was under Japanese rule. At an International Hydrographic Organization meeting in 2020, member states agreed on a plan to replace names with numerical identifiers and develop a new digital standard for modern geographic information systems.The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of “Gulf” and “Arabian Gulf” is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company's decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps.There have been other conversations about bodies of water, including from Trump’s 2016 opponent. According to materials revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of her campaign chairman’s personal account, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in 2013 told an audience that, by China’s logic that it claimed nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, then the US after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the “American Sea.”The body of water has been depicted with that name for more than four centuries, an original determination believed to have been taken from a Native American city of “Mexico.”In 2012, a member of the Mississippi Legislature proposed a bill to rename portions of the gulf that touch that state's beaches “Gulf of America,” a move the bill author later referred to as a “joke.” That bill, which was referred to a committee, did not pass.The Gulf of Mexico, a body of water spanning over half a million square miles, has been recognized on European maps since the 1500s. Trump’s proposal to rename it has sparked criticism from historians and foreign policy experts, who note that such a move would likely face significant international backlash.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo and outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have both spoken with Trump about his tariff threats in recent months. Neither leader has commented on the proposed renaming or merger suggestion, but political analysts predict that Trump’s statements could further strain North American relations.With his inauguration just weeks away, Trump’s comments have set the stage for a contentious start to his administration.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced his bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"" ""pretty soon"" after he takes charge in the Oval office.

Biden cancelled his visit

Windstorm to continue for several days

'We are safe and out'

Fire jumped from one side to other, road blocked

US firefighters on Tuesday battled to contain a fast-moving wildfire tearing through the celebrity-studded hillsides of Los Angeles, as powerful winds swept across Southern California.The flames, visible for miles, prompted frantic evacuations, with residents abandoning cars and fleeing on foot as gridlocked roads became impassable.According to LA Fire Department chief Kristin Crowley, the fire threatens nearly 26,000 people across more than 10,000 households and over 13,000 structures. Residents reported distressing scenes of people fleeing with their children and pets, amid tears and screams.A fire in western Los Angeles's Pacific Palisades area quickly spread across nearly 2 square miles (just over 5 square kilometers), creating a prominent smoke column visible throughout the city.Residents in Venice Beach, located about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, reported spotting the flames. The wildfire was one of several burning across the region.Authorities closed portions of Interstate 10 and the Pacific Coast Highway to non-essential traffic to facilitate evacuations. However, other routes remained impassable, compelling some residents to leave their vehicles and await rescue.The area that borders, approximately 20 miles (32 kilometres) west of downtown LA, comprises densely populated hillside streets with houses along winding roads near the Santa Monica Mountains, extending towards the Pacific Ocean beaches.Approximately half a million utility customers faced possible power cuts to minimise fire risks from equipment.Due to unpredictable weather conditions, Outgoing US President Joe Biden cancelled his visit to Riverside County, California, where he was scheduled to announce two new national monuments. Instead, Biden will deliver his speech in Los Angeles.According to the Associated Press, the most severe winds were anticipated between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Weather experts indicated the windstorm would continue for several days, with potential gusts reaching 100 mph (160 kph) in mountainous regions and foothills, particularly concerning in areas lacking recent rainfall.According to the National Weather Service, the wind event, expected to reach its peak early Wednesday, could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm affecting Los Angeles and Ventura counties in over ten years.The winds will rapidly dry vegetation, creating an extended period of fire danger, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""We really haven't seen a season as dry as this one follow a season as wet as the previous one,"" Swain said on Monday.Regions at risk of extreme fire conditions include the scorched remains of last month's wind-driven Franklin Fire, which devastated 48 structures—primarily homes—in and around Malibu.Actor James Woods shared video footage showing flames consuming bushes and moving past palm trees on a hillside near his residence. The intense orange flames surged through the landscaped gardens between houses.""We were blessed to have LA fire and police depts doing their jobs so well. We are safe and out. There are several elementary schools in our neighborhood and there was an enormous community effort to evacuate the children safely. Can not speak more highly of the LA fire and LAPD,"" Woods posted on X.Pacific Palisades resident and actor Steve Guttenberg requested people who left their vehicles to leave their keys, enabling movement of cars to create access for fire engines.""This is not a parking lot. I have friends up there and they can't evacuate. I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars,"" Guttenberg told KTLA. Video footages circulating show bulldozers clearing abandoned vehicles that were blocking the roads.Local resident Kelsey Trainor described how their neighbourhood's sole access route became completely blocked. They experienced falling ash whilst fires burned alongside the road.""We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,"" Trainor told the Associate Press.""People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour,"" he added.","Fire threatens nearly 26,000 people across more than 10,000 households and over 13,000 structures.

Expansionist ambitions

In a controversial news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump refused to rule out using military action to seize control of Greenland and retake the Panama Canal , citing “economic security” as his primary concern, Daily Beast reports.Responding to a question from The New York Times’ David Sanger, Trump was asked if he could assure the world he would not use “military or economic coercion” to claim the two regions. “No, I can’t assure you on either of those two,” Trump said, adding, “But I can say this, we need them for economic security .”Trump has made no secret of his interest in Greenland. On Monday, he took to Truth Social , declaring, “Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!”His comments follow a visit by Donald Trump Jr. to the island earlier this week. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen firmly dismissed the idea, reiterating that Greenland is not for sale.Trump’s expansionist vision doesn’t stop at Greenland. During the same news conference, he floated the possibility of renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” and hinted at using “economic force” to exert control over Canada .“Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,” Trump said.A day earlier, Trump taunted Canadians on Truth Social after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned. “Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State,” he wrote. “The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned.”While outlining his ambitions, Trump also complained about slow-dripping taps, uncomfortable electric heaters, and politically motivated prosecutors, blaming these issues on President Joe Biden.Despite his bold ideas, Trump made it clear he does not plan to use military force against Canada, preferring economic strategies instead.","President-elect Donald Trump refused to rule out using military action to seize control of Greenland and retake the Panama Canal.

Alcohol-induced blackouts: Accused blames drinking for memory loss of crime

In court: Accused pleads not guilty, requests medical supervision

In a harrowing case that has shocked Brooklyn, a Guatemalan immigrant accused of brutally setting a woman on fire aboard a subway train was so intoxicated that he didn’t even recognize his own actions when shown video footage of the crime, newly released court records reveal.Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , 33, allegedly had no memory of the December 22 attack on 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, a New Jersey woman, who was fatally burned while sleeping on the F train. According to transcripts from his stationhouse interview, the accused murderer was horrified when shown footage of the incident, reported the New York Post.“Oh damn, that’s me!” Zapeta-Calil allegedly exclaimed when the video played. “No, the truth is I don’t remember. Oh my goodness!”The Guatemalan national, who appeared visibly distressed, wiped his eyes and lowered his head as he processed the footage. His reaction — a combination of confusion, disbelief, and apparent shame — was captured in the newly unsealed interview, which took place hours after the chilling crime.The disturbing incident unfolded in the early hours of December 22. Police say Zapeta-Calil, heavily intoxicated, sat next to Kawam, who was sleeping on the train at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station. Without warning, he flicked a lighter and set her clothes on fire, before fanning the flames and callously watching her burn. Authorities say the woman was left to suffer in agony as the accused looked on.In a haunting twist, Zapeta-Calil told detectives that his black-out drinking was the cause of his actions, admitting to a long history of binge drinking. “Sometimes when I drink and erase the memory, I don’t know, right?” he allegedly told officers, referring to his frequent alcohol-fueled lapses in memory.“I drink in the afternoons. When I wake up, I’m already at the house, already sleeping. Or sometimes, I wake up, and I’m already at the train station,” Zapeta-Calil explained during his interview. “I was drunk. I don’t remember how I got on the F train. When I reacted, I was already on it.”Zapeta-Calil, who entered the United States illegally five years ago, was no stranger to trouble with the law. Authorities said he initially tried to cross the US-Mexico border in 2018 but was turned away. Undeterred, he snuck back into the country and eventually settled with relatives before finding his way into New York’s shelter system. His lawyer confirmed in court that he had been living in the US as an undocumented migrant, working as a roofer while frequently indulging in heavy drinking.According to his statements, the night before the horrific attack, he had been drinking heavily in a Queens bar. After drinking beer and tequila, he continued to drink alone before heading to the train. “When I woke up, I was already on the F train,” he said.Later that morning, around 8 or 9 am, Zapeta-Calil allegedly got off at the Coney Island station, approached the sleeping Kawam, and set her on fire. He was arrested hours later near Columbus Circle, his intoxicated state still apparent.In court on Tuesday, Zapeta-Calil, wearing an orange jumpsuit and jacket, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and arson. His defense attorney requested that he be placed under medical supervision while being held without bail. ""I am very sorry,"" Zapeta-Calil reportedly told detectives. “I didn’t mean to. But I really don’t know. I don’t know what happened, but I’m very sorry for that woman.”While the case has sparked widespread outrage, it has also raised troubling questions about the consequences of untreated alcoholism and the potential dangers of a system that failed to prevent his repeated offenses. As Zapeta-Calil’s court case moves forward, the community is left grappling with the horrific reality of the crime and the chilling disconnect between the accused’s drunken state and his horrific actions.Zapeta-Calil is scheduled to return to court in March, as prosecutors continue to build their case against him. For now, the city holds its breath, waiting for justice to be served in a case that has both horrified and mystified the public.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, allegedly had no memory of the December 22 attack on 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, a New Jersey woman, who was fatally burned while sleeping on the F train.

Trump trolls Canada as 51st state — But what if it actually happened?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-trolls-canada-as-51st-state-but-what-if-it-actually-happened/articleshow/117034868.cms,"Donald Trump. (AP)

A Blue-State Behemoth?

Could Trump really pull it off?

The ""What if"" factor

President-elect Donald Trump has once again turned heads with his latest comments about Canada — this time suggesting the country should join the US as its 51st state. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump jokingly mused about the merger, saying, ""Canada and the United States. That would really be something. They should be a state.""Trump went on to elaborate that such a union wouldn’t involve military action but rather “economic force,” implying that a more integrated North American economy could be a win for both nations. A day prior, he fueled the conversation further with a social media post, claiming that “many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State.”The former president emphasized the potential benefits, touting a union as a way to eliminate tariffs, lower taxes, and protect Canada from external threats, particularly from Russian and Chinese naval forces. ""Together, what a great nation it would be!"" he declared.While this is all part of Trump’s ongoing trolling of Canada, the idea of it becoming the 51st state has sparked some serious hypothetical questions. Would it really work? And what would it mean for US politics?If Canada did somehow become part of the United States, the political ramifications could be significant. With a population of over 40 million, Canada would immediately become the largest state in the Union, surpassing California. But the political shift might be even more profound.Canada has a history of left-leaning governments, with the Liberal Party in power for much of the last century. As a result, political analysts believe Canada would likely lean toward the Democratic side, boosting the party’s influence in the US Congress and presidential elections, reported Fox News.“It would be a massive political boon for Democrats,” said veteran Republican strategist Dave Carney. ""The voters who have supported Canada’s Liberal governments would probably vote for Democrats.""Political experts predict Canada’s inclusion would reshape US electoral dynamics. With two Democratic senators and millions of electoral votes, Canada would make a strong case for Democratic dominance. As Rich Lowry, editor-in-chief of National Review, warned, ""Canada would be a blue-state behemoth, matching California in population and, presumably, in reliably Democratic politics,"" reported Fox News.While the idea remains far-fetched, some believe Trump’s bold statements are part of a larger strategy aimed at negotiating with Canada. Carney, who has advised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and worked on numerous Republican presidential campaigns, suggests that Trump is playing a long game with these remarks.“Trump uses tools that no one would ever think of,” Carney said. ""He’s able to leverage soft power to get people to pay attention and push his agenda forward."" Indeed, Trump’s comments could be seen as a way to influence discussions with Canada on trade and security issues, reported Fox News.What if, against all odds, Canada actually joined the US? Political scientists like Wayne Lesperance predict that it would tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party. ""With 40 million voters and a congressman and senator delegation that’s more likely to oppose Trump, this would be a huge shift,"" Lesperance said.Democratic strategist Van Jones echoed this sentiment, calling Canada “a huge blue state” and even welcoming the hypothetical notion. ""If Canada wants to come here and rescue us, I am more than happy.""But let’s be real. While the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state is more fantasy than reality, it’s a scenario that has ignited plenty of political speculation and intrigue. So far, it seems like just another one of Trump’s playful provocations—but who knows? In his world, anything’s possible.","President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that Canada should join the US as its 51st state.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
