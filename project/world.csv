While they deem it too early for any form of accord, they believe it is vital to engage now so that when the moment comes both sides are ready.Paris will also underline the urgency of breaking the political deadlock in the country. Lebanon has neither a head of state nor a fully empowered cabinet since Michel Aoun's term as president ended in October 2022.Israel has remained cautious on the French initiative, although Israeli and French officials say Israel supports efforts to defuse the cross-border tensions.""The flames will flicker and tensions will continue,"" said a Lebanese diplomat. ""We are in a situation of strategic ambiguity on both sides.""France has 700 troops based in southern Lebanon as part of the 10,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force.Officials say the UN troops are unable to carry out their mandate and part of France's proposals are aimed at beefing up the mission by strengthening the Lebanese army.After Lebanon, Sejourne will head to Saudi Arabia before travelling to Israel.Arab and Western foreign ministers, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, will hold informal talks on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum event in Riyadh to discuss the Gaza war with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.","France has historical ties with Lebanon and earlier this year Stephane Sejourne delivered an initiative that proposed Hezbollah's elite unit pull back 10 km from the Israeli border.

NEW DELHI: Kristi Noem , a potential candidate for Donald Trump 's running mate, sparked outrage when she admitted to the deaths of a family dog and a goat.In her forthcoming memoir, Kristi Noem, who is currently the governor of South Dakota, disclosed that she killed an ""untrainable"" dog named Cricket on her family's farm.She described the 14-month-old dog as exhibiting behavior akin to a ""trained assassin"" and deemed it ""dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.""In her memoir, portions of which were initially shared by The Guardian on Friday, Noem further conveyed her strong dislike towards the dog, citing its interference with a hunt and its attacks on chickens owned by a local family.""I realised I had to put her down,"" she penned, explaining that she retrieved her firearm and subsequently guided Cricket to a gravel pit.Noem also said that her family possessed a male goat described as ""nasty and mean"" due to not being castrated.The goat emitted a ""disgusting, musky, rancid"" odor and delighted in chasing Noem's children, often knocking them down and spoiling their clothes.She said that she opted to euthanize the goat in the same manner as she had done with her dog.Responding to the excerpts, the Democratic Party under Joe Biden's leadership labeled them ""horrifying"" and ""disturbing,"" attempting to leverage the incident in a 2024 election context. ""If you prefer elected officials who refrain from boasting about the brutal killing of their pets as a part of their self-promotional endeavors, then heed our call - and cast your vote for Democrat candidates,"" the Democratic National Committee stated, echoing the sentiments of dog owners.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) condemned Kristi Noem's choice to euthanize the dog, asserting that she lacks an understanding of essential political principles, such as compassion and education.Colleen O'Brien, senior director at PETA, remarked, ""Most Americans cherish their dogs, and we anticipate that they will view Gov. Noem as extremely misguided for allowing this lively puppy to harm chickens and then opting to end her life rather than seeking training or locating a more suitable caregiver who could offer her a proper environment.""""In an official statement, she commented, 'Noem evidently lacks comprehension of crucial political principles such as education, cooperation, compromise, and compassion.'""Kristi Noem, however, stood up to defend herself against the criticisms surrounding her narrative of euthanizing her dog.""We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years,"" she wrote on her X (formerly Twitter) account.Her book, titled ""No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,"" is set to be published in the US on May 7.

The cause of the explosion remained unclear.Photographs from the scene depicted severely damaged structures still emitting smoke, with at least one building's roof blown off, and injured soldiers receiving medical attention in a hospital. Other images showed residential homes with roof damage.Such incidents are not common in Cambodia, which is awash with ammunition following decades of civil conflict -- accidents that are exacerbated by frequently lax safety standards.According to Col. Youeng Sokhon, an army officer stationed at the site, four buildings—including three storage facilities and one work area—were obliterated, while several military vehicles sustained damage.Cambodia's army said the incident was a ""warehouse ammunition explosion"", that had destroyed a truck fully loaded with weaponry.An office building as well as nearby barracks were destroyed, with 25 nearby homes also battered by the resulting explosion.In his statement, Hun Manet said he had ordered the defense minister and the commander-in-chief of Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to urgently arrange funerals for the soldiers who died and also to provide deceased's family members around USD 20,000 and injured soldiers would get USD 5,000.Cambodia bears the scars of decades of civil war from the 1960s, resulting in the widespread presence of abandoned ammunition and weapons across the country.In 2005, a tragic explosion occurred at a major military arms depot located approximately two kilometers outside the northwestern town of Battambang, claiming the lives of five Cambodians and injuring three others. The cause of the explosion and ensuing fire remained unclear.The country has been plagued by fatalities caused by mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), with approximately 20,000 individuals losing their lives since 1979, and twice as many sustaining injuries in landmine and UXO accidents.In 2018, an Australian and a Cambodian lost their lives in a war-era ordnance explosion during a de-mining training exercise in southern Cambodia.Efforts to clear mines and UXO persist, with the government committing to eliminate all such hazards by 2025. Despite ongoing clearance work, tragic incidents continue to occur. Recently, four individuals lost their lives due to UXO, according to the Cambodian Mine Action Centre.Just last year, a startling discovery was made inside a school in northeastern Cambodia, unearthing thousands of pieces of UXO remnants from the civil war, including around 2,000 explosives.(With inputs from agency)",An explosion of ammunition in Cambodia killed at least 20 soldiers and left numerous others injured on Saturday afternoon.

How Iran avoided escalation with Israel through quick military maneuvering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-iran-avoided-escalation-with-israel-through-quick-military-maneuvering/articleshow/109586561.cms,"By swiftly replacing the radar, Iran aimed to maintain its defensive posture and readiness, at least in appearance, to deter further Israeli strikes.

The replacement allowed Iranian propagandists to claim operational readiness and resilience, thereby managing domestic and international perceptions.

Most critically, by not responding further and instead quickly repairing the site, Iran avoided a potential escalation that could have drawn in more regional players and possibly led to a full-scale war.

Khamenei tacitly acknowledges that Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel

In a recent flare-up between Iran and Israel, where both nations exchanged missile and drone strikes, tensions soared, hinting at the potential for a broader conflict. However, the situation de-escalated as quickly as it escalated, with Iran making a strategic move to replace a destroyed air defense radar, thus avoiding further provocation and managing to save face on the international stage, a report in the Economist said.On April 13, for the first time in its history, Iran directly launched a barrage of drones and missiles toward an Israeli air base, which was met with a precise Israeli counterstrike.In response, the Israeli missiles on April 19 targeted and destroyed a critical piece of Iranian air defense, the 30n6e2 ""Tombstone"" radar , located near the heavily fortified Natanz nuclear complex. This radar is essential for tracking incoming air threats and guiding interceptor missiles.Following the Israeli retaliation, new satellite imagery analyzed by Chris Biggers, a former imagery analyst at America’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, revealed that Iran had swiftly replaced the destroyed ""Tombstone"" radar with a different model, the 96l6e ""Cheese board"" radar. This radar was placed in the exact location of the previous one, and the missile launchers appeared ready for action. Biggers noted that this switch was likely a tactic of ""denial and deception,"" aimed at portraying the site as still operational, despite the replacement radar's incompatibility with the existing defense system, the Economist report said.This quick substitution by Iran served multiple strategic purposes:Meanwhile, during a meeting with Iran's top military leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran's supreme leader, downplayed the effectiveness of a significant drone-and-missile attack on Israel, subtly admitting that the assault didn't achieve its intended impact. Despite the substantial scale of the attack, Khamenei emphasized that the number of missiles that hit their targets was not a priority.Khamenei's remarks, which were broadcast on state television, came in the context of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, particularly as conflicts continue in the Gaza Strip. He said, “Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn’t, these are of secondary importance.

NEW DELHI: Pro-Palestine, anti-war protests have gained momentum across universities in the US leading to the arrest of hundreds of students at Columbia University among others.The University of Southern California on Thursday cancelled its graduation ceremony, and dozens more college students were detained on other campuses throughout the country.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was also arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests .The protesting students are asking that institutions cut their financial ties with Israel and divest from firms that they believe are aiding the Gaza conflict.Last week, pro-Palestinian student demonstrators set up a tent encampment at New York's Ivy League universities. Police attempted to evict the encampment on April 18, arresting over 100 demonstrators. However, the approach backfired, energizing students around the country and prompting demonstrators at Columbia to regroup.On Wednesday, university administrators announced that they were extending the time for demonstrators to clear out. They said the demonstrators had agreed to remove a large number of tents and that only students would remain at the encampment. They also decided to prohibit all racist language and harassing messages.An Indian-origin student at Princeton University was arrested and barred from the campus for staging pro-Palestine protests. Coimbatore-born Achinthya Sivalingan is facing disciplinary action, a university spokesperson said.Protesters put up tents for a student-led pro-Palestine encampment in McCosh Courtyard around 7am on Thursday. Following warnings from University officials, two Princeton students were arrested, while the remaining protestors packed up their camping gear and resumed the action as a sit-in, according to the Princeton Alumni Weekly.US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Friday that viewpoints should be expressed in a 'peaceful' manner, emphasizing that 'nobody should feel threatened'.""It's the moment, you know, having a lot of discord in the world. And we in America believe opinions should be expressed, but nobody should feel threatened. If anything goes over the line where somebody feels individually threatened. That's something that's unacceptable, and there will be consequences,"" Envoy Garcetti told ANI.""At the same time, people do have that right to express their opinions, their differences in a peaceful manner, in a way where we can agree to disagree, agree, or we can respect each other's different opinions. And that's, I think, the goal for all of us,"" he added.As protests raged around campus, the University of Southern California canceled its graduation ceremony. The institution has previously canceled the graduating address of the school's pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns.According to the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 90 persons were arrested Wednesday night for allegedly trespassing during a university demonstration. One person has been arrested for alleged assault with a deadly weapon.To avoid demonstrations, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sealed most of the gates to its famed Harvard Yard before classes began Monday and restricted entrance to those with school identification.The school also erected banners telling students not to set up tents or tables on campus without permission. Despite these efforts, protesters set up a 14-tent camp on Wednesday, following a march protesting the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.On Thursday, Boston Police said that 108 persons were arrested at an Emerson College encampment. According to police, four officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.Earlier this week, at New York University, a student-led encampment grew to hundreds of demonstrators. On Wednesday, police reported they had arrested 133 protestors. They stated everyone was freed with a summons to appear in court on disorderly behavior charges.","Indian-origin student arrested in US, barred from varsity for taking part in protests.

'Asking for trouble': Why Japanese academics are shunning China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/asking-for-trouble-why-japanese-academics-are-shunning-china/articleshow/109640702.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Japanese academics are increasingly hesitant to attend events in China following the unexplained disappearance of Fan Yuntao , a 61-year-old expert in international law and politics based at Tokyo’s Asia University. Fan, who was last in contact with his family in April last year, reportedly told them he was being taken for questioning by Chinese government officials, according to Kyodo News.The unsettling incident is part of a troubling pattern involving several Chinese academics based in Japan, including Hu Shiyun and Zhu Jianrong, who have also vanished under mysterious circumstances.These cases have prompted fears among the academic community, leading to a decline in participation in academic events in China, a South China Morning Post report said.Fan’s university has confirmed that he is on leave but has refrained from providing further details to protect personal data. His disappearance has sparked significant criticism of the Japanese government’s passive approach, with social media users and academics alike decrying the lack of action.Yoichi Shimada, a professor of international relations at Fukui Prefectural University, expressed his reluctance to travel to China, citing the absence of assurances for his safe return. “There seems to be no clear reason for these arrests. It is impossible for me and other academics to go there now,” Shimada said.The issue also affects Japanese businesspeople and members of the Chinese diaspora who been arrested after returning to China. Jeff Kingston, an American director of Asian Studies at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, acknowledged the risks but noted his lower profile might spare him from such threats.Critics argue that Japan's response to these incidents is insufficient, particularly in light of Beijing’s new anti-espionage laws that have intensified fears of wrongful detention. Shimada further criticized the Japanese government’s ineffectiveness, stating, “I have no faith that the Japanese government would do much to get me home if I was accused of something; they are weak-kneed when it comes to China.”This situation highlights a growing concern over academic freedom and safety among Japanese scholars regarding engagement with Chinese institutions amid escalating geopolitical tensions.","Japanese academics are increasingly hesitant to attend events in China following the unexplained disappearance of Fan Yuntao.

‘Prefer remaining in jail for nine more years’: Imran Khan rules out negotiations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/prefer-remaining-in-jail-for-nine-more-years-former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-rules-out-negotiations/articleshow/109648481.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Ruling out any agreement, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars rather than engage in any negotiations with what he termed as the forces that have ""enslaved"" the nation.In his message, Khan highlighted what he described as the imposition of the ""worst dictatorship"" on the country, warning of its detrimental effects on the economy, governance, democracy and the judiciary.Having spent the past nine months in prison due to what he claimed are ""fake and concocted cases,"" Khan affirmed his readiness to continue serving time if necessary. ""I will remain in jail if I have to for nine more years, or more, but I will never strike a deal with those who have enslaved my nation”, Khan said in a statement.Since his ouster from power through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician has faced convictions in multiple cases, leading to his imprisonment at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has encountered challenges following his fall-out with the influential military, including arrests and defections, particularly after the unrest sparked by his arrest last year.Khan's statement follows remarks by PTI leader Shehryar Afridi, who asserted the party's willingness to engage in dialogue excluding certain political factions. He dismissed the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz as a ""rejected lot"" and reiterated the PTI's commitment to engaging with the army chief for Pakistan's future.Addressing speculation regarding alleged negotiations, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan reaffirmed the party's disinterest in and denial of any talks with external entities.Independent candidates supported by the PTI secured over 90 seats in the National Assembly during the February 8 general elections. However, a post-election alliance formed by the PMN-L and the PPP sidelined the PTI, preventing it from forming a federal government.","Imran Khan says he is ready to endure additional nine years behind bars.

Harvey Weinstein hospitalized after his return to New York from upstate prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvey-weinstein-hospitalized-after-his-return-to-new-york-from-upstate-prison/articleshow/109658565.cms,"NEW YORK: Harvey Weinstein 's lawyer said Saturday that the onetime movie mogul has been hospitalized for a battery of tests after his return to New York City following an appeals court ruling nullifying his 2020 rape conviction. Attorney Arthur Aidala said Weinstein was moved to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan after his arrival on Friday to city jails.""They examined him and sent him to Bellevue.It seems like he needs a lot of help, physically. He's got a lot of problems. He's getting all kinds of tests. He's somewhat of a train wreck health wise,"" Aidala said.A message left with the hospital was not immediately returned Saturday.Frank Dwyer, a spokesperson with the New York City Department of Correction, said only that Weinstein remains in custody at Bellevue. Thomas Mailey, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, said Weinstein was turned over to the city's Department of Correction pursuant to the appeals ruling. Weinstein had been housed at the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Albany.On Thursday, the New York Court of Appeals vacated his conviction after concluding that a trial judge permitted jurors to see and hear too much evidence not directly related to the charges he faced. It also erased his 23-year prison sentence and ordered a retrial.Prosecutors said they intend to retry him on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013.Weinstein remained in custody after the appeals ruling because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.For some time, Weinstein has been ailing with a variety of afflictions, including cardiac issues, diabetes, sleep apnea and eye problems.Aidala said he spoke to Weinstein on Friday afternoon after he was in transit to New York City from an upstate jail less than 24 hours after the appeals ruling, which was released Thursday morning.He said his client's ailments are physical, adding that mentally he is ""sharp as a tack. Feet are firmly planted on the ground.""The lawyer said it usually takes state corrections and prisons officials a week or two to arrange to transport a prisoner.""He was not treated well. They refused to give him even a sip of water, no food, no bathroom break,"" Aidala said. ""He's a 72-year-old sickly man.""Aidala said he was told that Bellevue doctors planned to run a lot of tests on Weinstein before he can be returned to the Rikers Island jail complex.The lawyer said he's scheduled to meet with Weinstein on Monday. He added that he plans to tell a judge when Weinstein goes to court on Wednesday in Manhattan that a retrial should occur after Labor Day.","Attorney Arthur Aidala said Weinstein was moved to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan after his arrival on Friday to city jails.

This coming week

NEW YORK: Even by Donald Trump 's standards, this was a dizzying week.The first criminal prosecution of a former president began in earnest with opening statements and testimony in a lower Manhattan courtroom. But the action quickly spread to involve more than half a dozen cases in four states and the nation's capital. Twice during the week, lawyers for Trump were simultaneously appearing in different courtrooms.The collision of so many cases within a five-day span underscores the challenges Trump will face as he campaigns again for the White House while his legal matters intensify. While the presumptive Republican nominee sought to talk about the economy and other issues, his intended message was repeatedly overshadowed by the latest developments popping up across the country.Here's how the week broke down and what's ahead:The week began with a moment for the history books, with prosecutors for the first time presenting a jury with a criminal case against a former American president. In opening statements, prosecutors told jurors that hush money payments made to an adult film actor were ""a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election"" while Trump's lawyers argued the case is baseless. Testimony then began with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker giving the public the most tangible look yet at the allegations.It also gave the clearest picture yet of Trump's defense and how he is blending his roles as candidate and criminal defendant. Trump is starting and ending the day appearing before waiting reporters at the courthouse, offering complaints that he is required to be there and commentary on how cold it is in the courtroom or remarks on unrelated national news.In a separate but nearby courthouse, one of Trump's lawyers struck a deal with New York state lawyers over a $175 million bond that Trump posted to pause a large civil fraud judgment he's appealing in a separate case.Trump returned to court where prosecutors began by urging the judge to hold Trump in contempt for social media posts that they said violated a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors and others involved. The judge did not immediately rule on the request but seemed skeptical of defense arguments that Trump was just responding to others' attacks.Pecker, a longtime Trump friend, testified the rest of the day and said he pledged to help suppress harmful stories about Trump during the 2016 election.Trial proceedings were not scheduled for Wednesday so Trump didn't trek to the Manhattan courthouse from his namesake penthouse tower. But he did fire off a post at 2 a.m. on Truth Social, his social media platform, criticizing the judge and did it again later in the day in an interview with Fox News Digital.Meanwhile, more court documents were unsealed in Florida in another criminal case in which federal prosecutors have charged Trump and two of his employees with mishandling classified documents after he left the White House. Though the case has proceeded at a plodding pace in recent months and seems unlikely to reach trial this year, the documents show, among other things, the warnings that Trump received from associates to return the sensitive files he was later charged with possessing.Beyond cases in which Trump is charged as a defendant, Arizona's attorney general on Wednesday indicted 18 of his associates for their roles in an effort to overturn Trump's loss in that state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Trump was referred to in the Arizona case as an unindicted co-conspirator.In a similar case in Michigan, a state investigator testified that he considers Trump to be an uncharged co-conspirator in that state's case against fake electors.Trump's hush money case in New York state court resumed Thursday. But prosecutors began the day by arguing before the judge that Trump had again violated the gag order with social media posts and comments he made early that morning at a dawn campaign stop in the city.New York state Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan has not yet ruled on whether to hold Trump in contempt. Pecker later resumed testimony. Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump aide who was among the 18 charged in Arizona a day earlier, was listening in the courtroom.At the same time in Washington, the US Supreme Court weighed whether Trump can be prosecuted over his efforts to undo his loss to Biden. The justices in their questions seemed skeptical of Trump's claims of absolute immunity from prosecution, but a few seemed to signal they had reservations about the charges, and that could result in a delay in that trial beyond November's election.In New York federal court on Thursday, a judge rejected Trump's request for a new trial in a defamation case in which he was ordered to pay $83.3 million to an advice columnist for his social media attacks over her claims that he sexually assaulted her.The hush money trial continued in New York on Friday, with Pecker wrapping up testimony and Trump's lawyers seeking to discredit him. Two other witnesses, Trump's longtime executive assistant Rhona Graff and Gary Farro, a banker for former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Epshteyn again was seated in the courtroom.The New York hush money case is not expected to resume until Tuesday because of a long-scheduled day off Monday. Testimony is expected to continue Thursday and Friday, giving Trump a chance to make campaign stops in Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday.On Thursday, the judge has scheduled a morning hearing on prosecutors' most recent push to punish Trump over the gag order.And in the Arizona case, details could emerge about the charges against Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows and former lawyer Rudy Giuliani.Sixteen of the 18 people indicted by a grand jury have been charged with conspiracy, fraud and forgery for their role in submitting a false slate of electors to Congress; the state attorney general has yet to confirm charges against the two remaining defendants. The indictment makes clear, based on their statements and positions, that they are Giuliani and Meadows, but the charges against them are still redacted.","The first criminal prosecution of a former president began in earnest with opening statements.

BOSTON: Police in riot gear detained about 100 people as they cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at a Boston university Saturday, the latest in a series of clashes on US campuses triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.The action was taken after some protesters resorted to ""virulent anti-Semitic slurs , including 'Kill the Jews,'"" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.The campus protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators across the country who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.In its statement, Northeastern said campus police backed by local law enforcement moved in Saturday to clear ""an unauthorized encampment"" on the campus.""What began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organizers with no affiliation to Northeastern,"" the school said.It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.""Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested,"" the school said.Tensions were also escalating Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, where the college president ordered a campus encampment to be disbanded immediately after what he said were ""credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct.""Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, announced Friday that it would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.""To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community,"" the leaders of the school said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.The decision was made even as Columbia signaled it had barred from campus Khymani James, a leader of the campus protests who had said in a video in January that ""Zionists don't deserve to live,"" and ""Be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.""""Chants, signs, taunts and social media posts from our own students that mock and threaten to 'kill' Jewish people are totally unacceptable, and Columbia students who are involved in such incidents will be held accountable,"" the school said.Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage.

US intelligence believes Vladimir Putin probably didn't order Alexei Navalny to be killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-intelligence-believes-vladimir-putin-probably-didnt-order-alexei-navalny-to-be-killed/articleshow/109645180.cms,"NEW DELHI: US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely did not order the killing of opposition politician Alexei Navalny at an Arctic prison camp in February, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.Navalny, who was 47 years old at the time of his death, was a prominent critic of Putin within Russia. His allies, labeled as extremists by Russian authorities, have accused Putin of orchestrating his murder and have pledged to provide evidence supporting their claim.Despite these accusations, the Kremlin has consistently denied any involvement in Navalny's death.Putin himself described Navalny's demise as ""sad"" and claimed he was willing to facilitate a prisoner exchange with the West, provided Navalny never returned to Russia. Navalny's associates asserted that discussions regarding such an exchange were ongoing.According to the Wall Street Journal's sources, while US intelligence agencies believe Putin likely did not order Navalny's killing, they have not absolved him of overall responsibility for Navalny's death. This conclusion stems from Navalny's history of being targeted by Russian authorities, including his imprisonment on charges deemed politically motivated by the West, as well as his poisoning with a nerve agent in 2020, an incident the Kremlin has denied involvement in.The Journal noted that the US assessment has been broadly accepted within the intelligence community and shared by several agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the office of the director of National Inelligence, and the State Department’s intelligence unit. The assessment is based on a variety of information, including classified intelligence, and an analysis of public facts, such as the timing of Navalny's death and its impact on Putin's re-election in March.In response to the US findings, Leonid Volkov, a senior aide to Navalny, criticized them as naive and ridiculous.","US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely did not order the killing of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.

The case so far

Appointment of judges

(With inputs from Dawn)

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah on Saturday said it was critical that a ""firewall"" be developed around the judicial system to ensure no external interference in the judiciary. The judge’s remarks come amid the situation revolving around the allegations made by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus, said a report by Dawn.On March 25, six IHC judges — out of a total strength of eight — wrote a startling letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, regarding attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes.The letter was signed by judges Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz.Addressing the 5th Asma Jahangir Conference with the theme of ‘People’s Mandate: Safeguarding Civil Rights in South Asia’, Justice Shah said: ""Firewalling is very important. There can be no external interference in our affairs. The judiciary will stand united against any interference that comes into our system and we take it seriously.""Justice Shah said that all institutions must realise that ""if there is no justice then they cannot exist"", adding that it was better for everyone if the justice system worked independently. ""Every institution is weakening itself if you weaken the justice system,"" said the Dawn report, quoting Justice Shah.“The justice system has to be strong, robust and independent for all the other institutions to develop, grow and prosper,” he added.The Supreme Court has clubbed a set of ten petitions and applications seeking the court’s intervention in response to allegations of ""intelligence agencies meddling in judicial affairs"".Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the bench includes Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Musarrat Hilali, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. They will resume the case on April 30, initiated on a suo motu.A day after the letter by IHC judges went public, calls emerged from various quarters for a probe into the investigation, amid which CJP Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court’s (SC) judges.After a meeting between CJP Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate the concerns of interference in judicial affairs following the cabinet’s approval. However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, subsequently recused himself from the matter, leading to the apex court taking a suo motu notice of the issue.On April 3, CJP Isa asserted that ""any attack"" on the judiciary’s independence would not be tolerated as he hinted at forming a full court to hear a suo motu case pertaining to allegations of interference in judicial affairs.Meanwhile, Justice Shah said that the judiciary needed to revisit how the judges were appointed at all levels and look at the examination pattern followed.“The appointment process has to be state of the art,” he said, adding that judges should only be appointed on merit.Justice Shah said that the appointment of cases was another matter that needed to be addressed, adding that the best decision in the matter was the Practice and Procedure Act which regulated the bench of the Supreme Court.""We have to strengthen the Practice and Procedure Act,"" he said, adding that the institution was very ""Chief Justice-specific-centric-driven"".","Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said it was critical that a ""firewall"" be developed around the judicial system to ensure no external interference in the judiciary.

Nawaz, 74, will be elected president of the ruling party on May 11 in a meeting of the party leadership , a senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader told PTI.In 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan disqualified Nawaz as premier and party president for his alleged corruption in cases related to the Panama Papers revelations about his illegal wealth stashed abroad.He relinquished his position within the party following his disqualification, which also led to his departure from the prime minister's office.PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah told a press conference that a decision to make Nawaz the president of the party again was taken at a party meeting on Friday.""A resolution was passed at the party meeting today to make the elder Sharif PML-N president to undo the injustice meted out to him (Nawaz) in 2017 by the Supreme Court,"" Sanaullah, a former interior minister, said.The party will request Nawaz on his return from China to accept the president's office of the party.Nawaz is currently on a five-day private visit to China.""Nawaz Sharif was removed from the party president's office through a conspiracy. Now Nawaz has been acquitted in all (corruption) cases, he should again take up the party's reins,"" Sanaullah said and added the party would be re-organised under his (Nawaz's) leadership.Sanaullah's announcement comes amidst internal tensions within the ruling party in Punjab and at the federal level, The Express Tribune newspaper said.Several prominent figures within the party, including Sanaullah, portfolio-less Federal Minister Javed Latif, Senator Javed Abbasi, and former Senator Asif Saeed Kirmani, have publicly criticised the leadership.Their remarks have ranged from questioning cabinet formations to expressing disillusionment with the party's alignment with the establishment, straying from its ""vote ko izzat do"" (respect the vote) slogan.The airing of these grievances has tarnished the party's reputation as a proponent of democracy.Following his return to Pakistan after a four-year self-exile in London in October last year, Nawaz got a clean chit in mega corruption cases allegedly with the blessings of the powerful military establishment.He was all set to become prime minister for the fourth time but his party failed to get a clear majority in the National Assembly on its own in the February 8 general elections.Nawaz then allowed his younger brother and the incumbent party president Shehbaz Sharif -- who is considered the favourite of the military establishment -- to lead a six-party coalition government at the Centre.","Pakistan's three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is all set to retake the helm of the ruling PML-N next month.

Iran president visits Sri Lanka without wanted minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/iran-president-visits-sri-lanka-without-wanted-minister/articleshow/109569123.cms,"COLOMBO : Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inaugurated a power and irrigation project in Sri Lanka on Wednesday, but arrived in the country without his interior minister, who is wanted over a deadly 1994 bombing.Raisi flew in after a state visit to Pakistan he made alongside Ahmad Vahidi, accused by Argentina of orchestrating the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people.Interpol issued a red notice requesting police agencies worldwide to take Vahidi into custody, and Argentina had asked both Pakistan and Sri Lanka to arrest him.But the minister was not seen accompanying Raisi, who had arrived in Sri Lanka to inaugurate an Iran-backed power and irrigation project.Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Vahidi was back in Iran on Tuesday, where he attended a ceremony to induct a new provincial governor.An official from Sri Lanka's foreign ministry told AFP that the interior minister was not listed as part of the Iranian delegation.The 1994 assault has never been claimed or solved, but Argentina and Israel have long suspected the Iran-backed group Hezbollah carried it out at Iran's request.Prosecutors have charged top Iranian officials with ordering the attack, though Tehran has denied any involvement.The court also implicated Hezbollah and called the attack against the AMIA -- the deadliest in Argentina's history -- a ""crime against humanity.""- Dam project -Raisi's Airbus A340 aircraft first landed at an airport in southern Sri Lanka nearby the $514 million Uma Oya irrigation and hydro-electricity project.It was due to be commissioned in March 2014 but international sanctions against Iran saw the project mired in a decade of delays, Sri Lanka has said.Raisi told a public rally at the Uma Oya site that Western countries tried to convince others that they were the sole source of knowledge and technology, but ""skilful Iranian experts"" had developed their own capacities.""Our enemies did not favour development and progress for Iran, but the Iranian people were determined in order to realise it,"" he said.Sri Lanka funded most of the dam project after an initial investment of $50 million from the Export Development Bank of Iran in 2010, while construction was carried out by Iranian firm Farab.Raisi then flew to the capital Colombo and was accorded a 21-gun salute before talks with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose office said the visit symbolised ""the cooperation between the two nations in this significant infrastructure endeavour"".The Uma Oya's two reservoirs are slated to irrigate 4,500 hectares (11,100 acres) of new land, while the hydro dam generators have a capacity of 120 megawatts.Iran is a key buyer of Sri Lanka's tea, the island's main export commodity.Sri Lanka is currently repaying a legacy debt of $215 million for Iranian oil by exporting tea. The country's only oil refinery was built by Iran in 1969.Raisi arrived in Sri Lanka after a three-day visit to Pakistan that followed tit-for-tat missile strikes in January in the region of Balochistan, which straddles the two nations' porous border.Tehran carried out the first strikes against an anti-Iran group inside Pakistan, with Islamabad retaliating by hitting ""militant targets"" inside Iran.Both nations have previously accused each other of harbouring militants on their respective sides of the border.","Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi arrives in Sri Lanka to inaugurate a power and irrigation project. He arrives without his interior minister, who is wanted over a deadly 1994 bombing in Argentina.
