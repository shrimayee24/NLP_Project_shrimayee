The defense rested its case on Friday in the manslaughter trial of Daniel Penny , a Marine veteran charged in the death of Jordan Neely , a homeless New York subway performer. In a notable decision, Penny chose not to testify in his own defense.The defense‚Äôs final witness was court clerk Brian Kempf, who testified about issuing an arrest warrant for Neely after he missed a court appearance in February 2023, as reported by the New York Post. This occurred two months before Neely‚Äôs death aboard an F train in May.Penny‚Äôs decision not to take the stand means the jury will not hear his personal account of the events leading up to Neely‚Äôs death.The 24-year-old is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The incident took place on May 1, 2023, on an uptown F train in Manhattan, when Penny restrained Neely in a fatal chokehold during an altercation.Witnesses described Neely as delivering an ‚Äúunhinged‚Äù rant toward passengers before Penny subdued him in a chokehold that lasted six minutes.Although Penny chose to remain silent, his attorney,Thomas Kenniff , addressed reporters after court proceedings. ‚ÄúThis jury has heard from Mr Penny. They heard from him before he had the opportunity to have an attorney. They heard him in the minutes and hours after this incident‚Ä¶ He told them what happened, and he said all the same things, all the same things in essence that the credible eyewitnesses testified.

How the ICC Decides on Cases





Genocide

War crimes

Crimes against humanity

Crimes of aggression

Decisions to issue arrest warrants follow these key steps:

1. Jurisdiction:

2. Investigation:

3. Authorization:





Who Must Comply



Arresting and transferring the accused to The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered.

Supporting investigations and facilitating evidence collection when requested.

Ensuring that their domestic laws allow for full cooperation with the ICC.

Challenges in Enforcement



With inputs from agencies

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed that Canada would comply with an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He emphasized that Canada is committed to upholding international law and adhering to the regulations and rulings of international courts, framing this as a core value of Canadian identity.Trudeau said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that everyone abide by international law. This is something we‚Äôve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts. This is just who we are as Canadians.""On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, citing allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict, ongoing for over a year. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, though Israel claims he was killed in a Gaza airstrike in July. Both Israel and Hamas have denied the accusations.Trudeau reiterated Canada‚Äôs call for a ceasefire to protect civilians and emphasized the need for progress toward a two-state solution, envisioning peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state. Foreign Affairs Minister M√©lanie Joly echoed this stance, affirming Canada‚Äôs commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the ICC treaty.Netanyahu‚Äôs office criticized the arrest warrants, labeling them an antisemitic move, while Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to Canada, Iddo Moed, urged the Canadian government to reject and condemn the ICC decision, framing it as undermining Israel's right to self-defense.In contrast, the United States, not an ICC member, rejected the warrants outright, citing concerns about the ICC Prosecutor‚Äôs process and expressing its intent to coordinate responses with allies. The ICC, lacking its own enforcement mechanism, relies on its 124 member states, including Canada, to act on its rulings.The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others based on allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses. These charges reportedly stem from actions taken since the start of the prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas. The court investigates and prosecutes cases of grave crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, particularly in situations where national legal systems are unable or unwilling to pursue justice.The ICC operates on the basis of complaints submitted to its Prosecutor, who then investigates whether there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case. This can include documentation from affected parties, states, international organizations, or civil society groups.The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute and has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute:The ICC determines whether the alleged crimes fall within its jurisdiction, which applies to actions committed on the territory of member states or by nationals of member states.The Prosecutor gathers evidence, often involving extensive collaboration with states, international bodies, and witnesses.If sufficient evidence exists, the court issues an arrest warrant or summons for the individual.4. Charges: The charges must meet the standard of being serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.The ICC operates independently but is bound by its treaty and legal frameworks.All 124 member states of the ICC, including Canada, are legally obligated to comply with its rulings and execute arrest warrants if the accused enters their jurisdiction. Compliance involves:States that are not members, like the United States and Israel, are not legally obligated to comply with ICC warrants. However, the ICC may still pursue its cases if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state or involve nationals of member states.The ICC lacks its own enforcement mechanism, such as a police force, so it relies entirely on member states to cooperate. In many cases, political considerations or opposition to the ICC‚Äôs authority can hinder compliance, as seen with resistance from countries whose leaders or officials are targeted by ICC rulings.","The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

Known for her sharp legal mind and media-savvy approach, Bondi made waves during her two terms as Florida‚Äôs Attorney General from 2011 to 2019.A graduate of the University of Florida and Stetson University College of Law, Bondi began her career as a prosecutor in Hillsborough County. Her passion for public service and ability to navigate complex legal landscapes quickly elevated her profile within Florida politics.As Florida Attorney General, Bondi tackled major issues, including:Her legal acumen gained national attention in 2020 when she joined Donald Trump's legal team during his first impeachment trial. Her ability to deliver sharp, memorable arguments cemented her place as a trusted Trump ally.However, her career has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to donations from Trump's foundation to Bondi's political action committee while her office was deciding on a case involving Trump University‚Äîa matter she ultimately declined to pursue.Now being floated as a top contender for Attorney General in a potential Trump administration , Bondi‚Äôs fiery conservatism and seasoned legal expertise could make her a key figure in the next chapter of Trump‚Äôs political saga.In the 2024 US presidential election , Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, but their ticket was decisively defeated by Trump and Vance. The Harris-Walz campaign struggled to connect with working-class voters, facing criticism over economic issues and governance challenges. Despite the loss, Walz‚Äôs selection highlighted his leadership record as a progressive governor and former congressman.","Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General, and prominent figure in conservative circles.

It was also a reminder that the power dynamics in the longtime rivalry between the world's two richest men changed Nov 5.Plenty of tech executives have drawn Trump's wrath over the last few years. Perhaps none more than Bezos, largely because he owns Washington Post, which has often written critically about Trump.Trump complained Amazon had an unfair deal with the Postal Service. There was also a legal battle over whether he had meddled in a $10 billion military cloud computing contract many expected Amazon would win. The contract was awarded to Microsoft before it was cancelled altogether.Few if any corporate barons have had as much influence over an incoming presidential administration as Musk seems to have. He hitched himself to Trump's campaign and has become a near constant presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.

What immigration policies are expected in Trump's second administration?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-immigration-policies-are-expected-in-trumps-second-administration/articleshow/115574752.cms,"Donald Trump (Picture credit: Reuters)

Mass deportations

Enhancing border security

Defending family separations

Ending Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

US President-elect Donald Trump is poised to intensify his crackdown on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration when he returns to the White House on January 20, 2025. Trump reaffirmed his approach to immigration during a campaign rally in Duluth, Georgia, saying, ""Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.""The following are some of the immigration policies Trump is expected to implement during his second administration:Trump has announced plans to enact large-scale deportations if he returns to office. This initiative, aimed at individuals residing in the US illegally, seeks to return millions to their countries of origin. The president-elect intends to utilize executive orders to increase immigration enforcement immediately upon assuming office. He confirmed on his social media platform, Truth Social, that this would involve declaring a national emergency and deploying military resources, with the aim of surpassing any previous administration's deportation numbers.Trump‚Äôs plan directly contrasts with President Biden's current immigration policies, which prioritize apprehending serious criminals while minimizing action against those without criminal records. Trump has pledged to reverse these policies immediately upon taking office.During his 2020 campaign, Trump described the deportation process as ‚Äúa bloody story.‚Äù He also expressed openness to constructing new detention centers for migrants.Texas has offered Trump approximately 1,400 acres of land near the US-Mexico border to aid in this effort. The use of the National Guard, and possibly federal troops, to apprehend and deport individuals is also under consideration.Trump's plan includes deporting immigrants with criminal histories and suspected gang affiliations. He intends to utilize the Alien Enemies Act, a law enacted in 1798 and last implemented during World War II to detain individuals of Japanese, German, and Italian descent.Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump‚Äôs previous immigration policies, is expected to play a significant role in a potential second term. Miller has suggested the possibility of deploying National Guard troops from supportive states to less cooperative ones to facilitate deportations. This strategy could spark legal disputes.Trump has also previously advocated for the death penalty for migrants who commit murder against US citizens or law enforcement officers.Current deportation figures under the Biden administration have already surpassed any single year under Trump. In the 2023 fiscal year, 468,000 migrants were either deported or returned to Mexico by US immigration authorities, with projections indicating a higher number for the current year.Trump has pledged to increase border security on his first day back in office by sending National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border and restarting construction of the border wall. He plans to utilize a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the wall.Trump also intends to reinstate his ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, which requires asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their cases are processed in US courts. Additionally, he aims to detain all migrants apprehended crossing the border illegally, ending what he calls ""catch and release.""Furthermore, Trump plans to implement travel bans targeting individuals from specific countries or those with certain ideologies.‚ÄúAnywhere else that threatens our security,‚Äù Trump said in an October 2023 speech, outlining potential targets for renewed travel bans, including the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.Trump also aims to curtail legal immigration by ending humanitarian ""parole"" programs enacted by the Biden administration, which have allowed a significant influx of migrants with US sponsors. He intends to reduce the number of refugees admitted to the United States.Trump has defended his administration's controversial family separation policy at the US-Mexico border. In a November 2023 interview with Univision, Trump said that the policy, which separated thousands of migrant families in 2018, ""stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.""During a CNN town hall last year, Trump declined to say whether he would restart the policy if re-elected. The policy sparked widespread condemnation and legal challenges.Trump's potential ""border czar,"" Tom Homan, expressed reservations about the policy. Homan told Reuters last year that the separations ""caused an uproar"" and suggested it would be preferable to detain families together.The Biden administration reached a settlement agreement in 2022 with families separated under the Trump policy, granting them temporary legal status and other benefits. The agreement also prohibits similar family separations for at least eight years.The Trump administration has confirmed it will not accept new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and will seek ways to end it. DACA, established during former president Barack Obama's administration, provides temporary deportation relief and work permits to eligible immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. Trump has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the program.According to a New York Times report, Trump plans to try to end DACA. His decision follows a Supreme Court ruling in June 2020 that found the Trump administration's attempt to end DACA was improper but did not rule on the program's legality. The Trump administration said it would explore other legal avenues to end DACA.","US President-elect Donald Trump is poised to intensify his crackdown on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration when he returns to the White House on January 20, 2025.

Trump pleaded not guilty, claiming the case was politically motivated by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his campaign.His legal team argued that continuing the case would ""hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus."" The offense carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison, although experts have suggested alternatives like fines or probation due to the unlikelihood of imprisonment before his election.Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in November 2024 complicated sentencing options, as imprisonment or probation could disrupt his presidential duties.

PESHAWAR: A mob ransacked and set fire to two police check points on Friday to protest the killing of nearly 50 people by militants in the restive province in northwest Pakistan . Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing around 50 people, mostly Shias, in one of the worst attacks in the region in recent years.Rescue authorities said around 50 people, including eight women and five children, were killed and 20 others injured in the attack while police initially confirmed 45 deaths. The toll was raised to 47 on Friday.No group claimed responsibility for the attack on passenger vans.On Friday, in response to the Thurday's killings, all markets and educational institutions in Parachinar remained closed even as enraged locals blocked the main road by burning tires.After a lot of protests, the crowd ransacked Bab-e-Kurram, an entry point to Baggan Main Bazar and burnt two police check points at Palachinar.Deputy Commissioner Kurram Javed Ullah Mehsud said efforts are underway to save the lives of those injured in the barbaric shooting. ""We will restore the routine life as quickly as possible,"" he said.A grand jirga (traditional council) will be called to discuss problems hampering restoration of peace in the district.Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for the individuals who were killed in the incident in Bagan and Ochit, Lower Kurram.Tribal leaders from Turi and Bangash communities, including Jalal Bangash, expressed their deep concerns.They stated that for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel routes.Two weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.The intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.The fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.Similar clashes in the same region in July left dozens of people dead and more than 225 injured.","Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire. Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan‚Äôs President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari‚Äôs sentiments, terming the attack a ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan‚Äôs Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

The case centers on accusations that the couple illegally acquired and sold state gifts worth over 140 million Pakistan rupees (¬£501,000) during Khan's tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. Both Khan and his wife deny the allegations.The Toshakhana case alleges that Khan misused state-owned gifts, including diamond jewelry and seven luxury watches , six of which were Rolexes.

Extortions bleed Pak‚Äôs terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ‚Äôs restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.‚ÄúA family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,‚Äù Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by ‚Äúallies in the govt‚Äù that he ‚Äúshould not count‚Äù on them to keep him safe. ‚ÄúEither pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,‚Äù he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. ‚ÄúThis was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,‚Äù Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP‚Äôs letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.‚ÄúThe key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,‚Äù Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. ‚ÄúDespite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,‚Äù a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.
