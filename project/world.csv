‘Tipu-Ipu ko maro’: Himanta Biswa Sarma backs dropping ‘Great’ from Akbar; row over alleged NCERT move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tipu-ipu-ko-maro-himanta-biswa-sarma-backs-dropping-great-from-akbar-row-over-alleged-ncert-move/articleshow/125515140.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday backed NCERT’s alleged move to drop the word “Great” from the names of Mughal emperor Akbar and Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in school history textbooks.Speaking at an event in Bongaigaon, he said, ""Tipu-Ipu ko maro ekdum. Jahan bhejna hai, udhar hi bhej do. Samundar mein phek do"" (Beat up that Tipu. Send him wherever you want to. Throw him in the sea.)Sarma said he had not personally seen the revised textbooks, but if NCERT had made these changes, he welcomed them. A day earlier, RSS leader Sunil Ambekar had claimed that titles like “Akbar the Great” and “Tipu Sultan the Great” had been removed from the books, while stressing that no historical figure had been taken out. The alleged move by NCERT triggered quick political reactions.Congress MP Imran Masood criticised the change, saying it was an attempt to rewrite history and ignore the contributions of rulers who shaped the subcontinent over centuries. He argued that removing titles or names would not change historical facts and pointed to India’s prosperity during parts of their rule.""They ruled the country for 700 years. They didn't rule for just a day or two.You removed their names, but what will the removal or addition achieve? During their rule, GDP was 27 per cent. India was also called the golden bird. They came here and perished here. The last emperor was beheaded, but he did not accept British slavery. He saw his sons' heads adorned on a platter. But he wouldn't accept slavery,"" the Congress MP said.Masood also said those who had “bowed before the British” were now in power, and questioned why descendants of people who “betrayed Rani Lakshmibai” held ministerial posts.Congress leader K Muraleedharan also said the decision to drop the word “Great” from Akbar and Tipu Sultan was unfair. He said Akbar promoted communal harmony and gave Hindus freedom in his rule, while Tipu Sultan fought the British and died because of it.Supporting the revision, VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said past textbooks had “distorted” history. He questioned calling Akbar “great” and said such glorification of Mughal rulers was unacceptable.""How can Akbar be great when Maharana Pratap is great? Are Akbar's misdeeds hidden from anyone? The glorification of Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Aurangzeb cannot be allowed on the sacred land of Maharana Pratap,"" he said, thanking NCERT for the correction.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma backs NCERT’s alleged move to drop the word “Great’ from the names of Mughal emperor Akbar and Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in school history textbooks.

MARGAO: Two women’s organisations in Goa have voiced strong opposition to a proposed ‘Tales of Kamasutra & Christmas Celebration’ event on December 25-28 and called on authorities to investigate and block the festival.Goa Women’s Forum (GWF) and Bailancho Ekvott have lodged separate complaints against the event, which they claimed would damage state’s reputation as a familyfriendly tourist destination and promote sex tourism.In a letter to tourism director Kedar Naik, GWF said the event was being promoted by an organisation identifying itself as ‘Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh Foundation’ and allegedly charging participants Rs 25,000 for accommodation and food. “We seek your immediate intervention by filing an FIR, launching a full-fledged investigation to determine the antecedents of this ‘Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh Foundation’ and identifying the venue for this proposed programme. ”Bailancho Ekvott said the event was an abuse of religious freedom and assault on Catholic tradition. “To take the focus away from worship, prayers, this sort of tantrism is uncalled for.” It also said the festival was “a culture crisis for Goan Catholics” and called it a blow to Catholicism in Goa.",Goa Women’s Forum (GWF) and Bailancho Ekvott have lodged separate complaints against the event.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

Parents allege ‘culture of bullying’ at private school

(With agency inputs)

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, "" it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive"".According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.Several parents gathered at Shaheed Smarak Saturday to protest and demand action against Neerja Modi School, where 9-year-old Amaira Kumar fell to her death from the fourth floor on Nov 1. They alleged that incidents of bullying at the school were ""not isolated, but rampant"".","The Central Board of Secondary Education issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur.

BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla commended Tharoor for his remarks and said he hoped that Rahul Gandhi would get the message.After months of attacks against each other during the high voltage New York City mayoral election, Trump and Mamdani adopted a mutually warm tone during their first meeting at the White House in Washington DC. Reposting on X a video of a media interaction where Trump and Mamdani took questions on their meeting, Tharoor said, ""This is how democracy should work.

G20 Leaders’ Declaration: 'We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations'

PM Modi at G20 Summit





NEW DELHI: The G20 bloc in South Africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the United States.In a break from tradition, the world leaders adopted the joint declaration at the start of the summit as opposed to concluding day of discussions. The US boycotted the event due to a diplomatic rift with the host country.The 2025 G20 Leaders’ Declaration in Johannesburg under South Africa's presidency centres on climate ambition, debt relief and development justice, with a strong political message on multilateralism, terrorism and global conflicts. The document “unequivocally” condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, aligning with India’s long‑standing demand that there are no “good” and “bad” terrorists.Leaders reiterated support for an open, fair, inclusive and rules‑based multilateral trading system and call for reform of the WTO to make it more responsive to development concerns. It frames everything under South Africa’s theme of “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability”, with an explicitly pro–Global South tiltAccording to Reuters, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the US objected to the wording of the declaration.However, he emphasised that it could not be “renegotiated.” His remarks underscored growing tensions between Pretoria and Washington.In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa acknowledged the ""overwhelming consensus and agreement for the declaration. He said, ""There's been overwhelming consensus and agreement that one of the other tasks we should undertake right at the beginning is to adopt our declaration.""Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, noted that the declaration was adopted unusually early in the proceedings, a move driven by the strong support it received. ""Normally, the adoption of the declaration happens right at the end. But there was a sense that we should actually move to have the summit declaration adopted first as the first order of the day,” Magwenya said, according to AP.The South African officials also confirmed that Trump had put pressure on them not to adopt a leaders' declaration in his absence. ""We had the entire year of working towards this adoption, and the past week has been quite intense,"" the spokesperson said.The declaration statement highlights growing global instability driven by geopolitical rivalries, economic fragmentation, and widening inequalities. It stresses the importance of multilateral cooperation as essential to addressing shared global challenges.The declaration also reaffirms commitment to the UN Charter’s principles, calling on all states to avoid the use or threat of force against the sovereignty or territorial integrity of others. It urges nations to promote friendly relations, uphold human rights, and ensure equality irrespective of race, gender, language, or religion.Read Also : G20 Summit: PM Modi proposes 4 big initiatives; focus on healthcare, knowledge and war on drugs It also commits to working for a just and lasting peace in conflict zones such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Ukraine, emphasising that global peace is fundamental to achieving sustainable development and prosperity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a three-day visit to South Africa to attend the G20 summit. He spoke at the summit about inclusive and sustainable growth. In a post on X, he highlighted the need to revisit the development parameters.""Spoke at the first session of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, which focused on inclusive and sustainable growth,"" the Prime Minister wrote, ""Now is the right moment for us to revisit our development parameters and focus on growth that is inclusive and sustainable. India’s civilisational values, especially the principle of Integral Humanism, offer a way forward.""He has also held talks with the world leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.US President Donald Trump is boycotting the event as the agenda for the meeting that focuses on climate action and energy transition does not align with the US policy.The inclusion of the term “climate change” was widely seen as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of global warming. For many observers, the language in the declaration underscored a deliberate effort by participating nations to reaffirm their commitment to climate science despite past US scepticism.","The G20 bloc in South Africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the United States.

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet at the Dubai Air Show 2025 has prompted defence experts to raise the possibility of a “G-force blackout”, after visuals showed the aircraft abruptly losing height during a low-altitude manoeuvre before plunging to the ground. Wing Commander Naman Syal, who was piloting the aircraft, died in the incident.Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.) said the nature of the crash suggested the pilot may have lost control during the manoeuvre or experienced a blackout linked to high gravitational forces. Speaking to ANI, he said, “It is sad that our Tejas jet was crashed during the Dubai air show and our brave pilot lost his life. From the visuals, it seems that the jet lost control during the acrobatics, or there might have been a pilot blackout. Blackout here means the excessive gravitational force.” He added that pilots wear G-suits to prevent blood from pooling in their legs, and only data retrieved from the cockpit would confirm what happened.The Indian Air Force said the aircraft went down during an aerial display on Friday, adding, “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.”A court of inquiry has been ordered.The Dubai Media Office said emergency teams “responded rapidly to the incident and are currently managing the situation on-site”.Also Read: IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show Back in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, the death of Wing Commander Syal has left his home village of Patiyalkar grief-stricken.

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command.

SRINAGAR: J&K police’s State Investigation Agency (SIA) detained Saturday a man from Srinagar’s Batamaloo area for allegedly circulating posters threatening police and security forces in mid-Oct — material that later helped expose an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed inter-state terrorist module involving doctors and others.Police sources said he was detained in connection with the Jaish posters that surfaced on Oct 17 in Bonpora, warning security personnel. Saturday’s detention marks SIA’s first action since it assumed control of the poster probe from J&K police.The man is also suspected of being a conduit in delivering an AK-47 rifle to Dr Adeel Majeed Rather, an accused in the transnational network linked to the Nov 10 car explosion in New Delhi. The weapon was discovered in a locker assigned to Adeel at Govt Medical College (GMC) in Anantnag, where he worked as a resident doctor before moving to a private hospital in UP’s Saharanpur. Adeel was arrested when police forces from J&K, UP and Haryana busted the alleged JeM module of medics before the Delhi blast Earlier, the posters led to the detention of three youths, whose interrogation resulted in the arrest of suspect Moulvi Irfan Ahmad Wagay, also known as “Mufti Sahab”. The cleric allegedly guided police towards the network.Medical Faculty Association (MFA) of GMC Srinagar condemned Delhi blast, saying violence is “painful and disturbing”, and such acts have no acceptance in civilised society.

He encouraged students to stay focused on their goals, remain aware of contemporary challenges, and contribute meaningfully to nation-building,” police said in a statement.“A healthy interaction followed, during which students raised questions about education, career prospects, law enforcement, and social issues.

SRINAGAR: A draft proposal submitted by Leh Apex Body (LAB) to the Centre says granting “general amnesty” to its member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and other detainees over the Sept 24 violence is a must for talks to continue smoothly.LAB is an amalgam of social, political and religious groups spearheading an agitation over statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, which became a Union Territory in 2019. It submitted the 29-page draft proposal to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) earlier this week.“The extension of such a general amnesty would serve as a huge confidence-building measure that would reinforce the spirit of dialogue and mutual trust between the people of Ladakh and the Government of India. Such a healing hand approach shall ensure Ladakh always remains the peaceful place it has been known for,” the draft states. Wangchuk has been charged and jailed under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).The document begins with references to the September 24 Leh violence in which four locals were killed, allegedly in the police firing, after the protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status turned violent.“What transpired on Sept 24, 2025, and the subsequent events, is unprecedented in a place like Ladakh, and those incidents have shaken the fabric of the people. Keeping in consideration the conduct of Ladakhis for the last many years and their peaceful means of protest, it is important to release all persons detained and withdraw cases against them unconditionally,” the draft states.Stressing that “extension of Sixth Schedule protection to Ladakh and granting it full statehood with appropriate constitutional safeguards under Article 371 of the Constitution are important at this juncture”, the draft said fulfilment of these “demands shall further help in restoring peace and build confidence”.The draft says the proposals are in accordance with an understanding at a meeting between Ladakhi leaders and a high-powered MHA committee on Oct 22 to have a “constructive framework for further deliberations”.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

NEW DELHI: On a chilly winter night in 2005, Mirza Shadab Baig, an engineering graduate, moved into a dingy room in southeast Delhi's Zakir Nagar.The next two years witnessed the formation of what was called the notorious ‘Azamgarh module' of Indian Mujahideen (IM) and the transformation of Baig into a notorious and radical jihadi.His ruthlessness can be gauged from the fact that during the Delhi serial blasts in 2008, he is said to have specifically targeted a children's park near India Gate.While bombs exploded at Karol Bagh, Connaught Place and Greater Kailash, the one planted by Baig at the park was detected in time and defused.Now presumed to be somewhere along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Baig's name has cropped up with his alma mater, Al-Falah University, in the spotlight in connection with the Nov 10 explosion near Red Fort.Baig, an accused in multiple blasts in India between 2007 and 2011, got his bachelor's degree in engineering from the Faridabad university in 2007, investigators looking into last week's blast, said on Thursday.The son of a doctor from Azamgarh, Baig initially worked with HCL Infosystems in Noida. However, along with Asadullah Akhtar and Ariz Khan, his classmates from Jyoti Niketan school in Azamgarh, Baig eventually chose the path of terror after being radicalised.Once Baig moved to Zakir Nagar, he met Atif Ameen of Batla House infamy, who lived in nearby Shaheen Bagh. A police charge sheet details how this meeting changed the course of life of not only Baig, but also Akhtar and Khan. Ameen made them listen to speeches of Jaish-e-Muhammed founder Maulana Masood Azhar, showed them clips of the Palestine conflict and gave them magazines on related topics.Later, Ameen and Baig founded the Azamgarh/Sanjarpur modules of IM that carried out multiple blasts across the country. On Nov 23, 2007, the outfit planted IEDs on court premises in Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow. It sent an email to news channels five minutes prior to the blasts to claim responsibility — the first time IM owned up to a terror attack.Baig, like the Nov 10 bomber, Umar Un Nabi — a doctor who, too, was associated with Al-Falah — wanted to carry out blasts on a massive scale. ""Ab pattern change karna hoga,"" read a message on Akhtar, aka Hadi's mobile phone, which was retrieved by the special cell of Delhi Police.The sender was Baig, who wanted to engineer a 26/11-type attack or at least reach its scale in terms of casualties and destruction. Years later, Umar actually changed the pattern, carrying out the first suicide car bombing in the capital, which killed 15 people.Shortly after the Batla House encounter in Jamia Nagar in 2008 in which Ameen and another terrorist was killed, Baig fled the country and went to Pakistan.He and a few others like Dr Shehnawaj and Shafi Armar flirted with what was called Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) before forming Ansar-ud Tawhid, another outfit. Pakistan's ISI continues to be their primary recruiter.","Mirza Shadab Baig, an engineering graduate, moved into a dingy room in southeast Delhi's Zakir Nagar in 2005.

Police on Thursday seized the girl’s mobile phone and the suicide note, which contains detailed accusations describing the teacher’s alleged conduct in the classroom.In the note, the girl wrote that the teacher would grab her hand under the guise of punishing her, clench his fist and challenge her to open it, or press a pen between her fingers with force. “Whenever the teacher beat me… he would grab my hand. He would hold my hand over the bench and say, ‘Look how cold my hand is.’ What is all this?” she wrote.The girl’s grandfather and father told police that she had no issues at home. They alleged that the pressure and humiliation she faced at school pushed her toward the extreme step.During questioning, the girl’s elder sister named a minor boy from her class with whom the deceased used to speak. However, police said preliminary probe shows no evidence linking the boy to the suicide, calling their interactions “normal friendship.”","A Class 11 student died by suicide in Rewa after allegedly facing sustained harassment from a schoolteacher.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast

KOLKATA: An earthquake of magnitude 5.7 struck near Dhaka capital of Bangladesh on Friday. The tremors were reported in Kolkata and several parts of Northeast India, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).The quake struck 13 km south-southwest of Narsingdi in the Bangladesh at 10.08am, and at a depth of 10 km, it said. Several people in Kolkata and other districts were seen coming out on the streets as a precautionary measure.Residents in Kolkata reported brief tremors around 10:10 am, describing them as lasting only a few seconds. Within minutes, videos of the moment began circulating widely on social media.Similar mild tremors were also felt in Guwahati, Agartala and Shillong, according to early reports.There was no immediate report of any injury or damage.In October, Bangladesh experienced a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Shallow quakes like this produce stronger shaking as seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface. Globally, earthquakes occur roughly every 30 seconds, though most are too minor to be noticed.Bangladesh sits at the junction of three tectonic plates—the Indian, Eurasian, and Burma plates.The Indian plate moves northeast at about 6 cm per year, while the Eurasian plate shifts north at roughly 2 cm annually.The country is crisscrossed by several major fault lines, including the Bogura, Tripura, Dauki, and Assam faults, as well as the Shillong Plateau, placing it within 13 earthquake-prone zones.High-risk areas include Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts, and Jaintiapur in Sylhet.Dhaka, with a population density exceeding 30,000 people per square kilometre, is among the world’s densest cities and ranks as one of the 20 most earthquake-vulnerable cities globally, according to The Daily Star.","5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast India.

They lit candles, placed flowers around Patil’s garlanded photograph and held placards demanding justice.His maternal uncle said the protest might be shifted to the residences of the accused teachers from Monday.Another student maintained that the entire school should not be blamed for the actions of a few individuals.Patil had mentioned sustained humiliation by four teachers in his suicide note. All four teachers have since been suspended.On November 18, while his father was away, the Class X student left for school and later died after allegedly jumping from Platform No.2 of Rajendra Place Metro Station.Police recovered his school bag at the spot, which contained a handwritten suicide note blaming the teachers for his suffering.Police teams have begun examining student statements, school records and the alleged pattern of harassment mentioned in the FIR.Meanwhile, parents and students protesting outside the school have demanded suspension of the teachers named in the complaint and a full, transparent investigation into the incident.","Shourya Patil, 16, a Class X student of St Columba’s School, died by suicide on November 18.

'All Americans At Risk': Chicago Frees 600+ Jailed 'ILLEGAL ALIENS' | Trump Explodes At 'WOKE' Judge

Trump weighs in with claims





One person was killed and at least eight teenagers were wounded in two separate shootings late Friday in Chicago’s Loop, only hours after the city lit its official Christmas tree in Millennium Park.The first incident took place around 9.50 pm (US local time) near State and Randolph streets, close to the Chicago Theatre. Police on patrol heard shots fired into a large crowd in the 100 block of North State Street. Seven teenagers, aged 13 to 17, were taken to Stroger Hospital and Lurie Children’s Hospital. Six were listed in good condition and one in fair condition, according to The New York Times.Shortly afterward, a second shooting occurred on the 100 block of South Dearborn Street. One man later died at Northwestern Hospital, while an 18-year-old was treated for a serious leg wound.Witnesses described chaos as people ran for safety. Linda Dixon, leaving the Chicago Theatre at the time, said, “We almost got knocked in the street, because everyone was running that way. It is very disheartening… Holiday time, everybody wants to celebrate and enjoy the evening, and something like this happens.”Police said no suspects were in custody. Investigations into both shootings are ongoing.US President Donald Trump reacted to the shootings in a post on Truth Social , alleging “massive crime and rioting in the Chicago Loop area” and claiming “multiple police officers” were “attacked and badly injured,” though police have not reported any officer injuries.He criticised Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for resisting National Guard deployment during unrest linked to the administration’s immigration crackdown.Mayor Johnson condemned the violence, saying such incidents “cannot continue” despite increased police presence. “We have too many guns and too many young people who do not value their lives or the lives of others,” he told CBS News, adding that 300 additional officers would be assigned for Saturday night’s holiday parade.Earlier last month, US President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of around 500 National Guard troops near Chicago, despite objections from Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who criticised the move as an unnecessary militarisation of the cityRich Guidice, former head of the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications and ex–chief of staff to Johnson, argued the city was addressing symptoms rather than root causes. “The parents of these teens must take responsibility. These are young children, under 17 years old,” he said.","One man killed and at least eight teenagers wounded in two separate shootings in Chicago's Loop late Friday.

Germany's Merz Warns Trump On Ukraine Peace Plan Deadline For Zelensky | 'NO DEAL WITHOUT CONSENT'

US insists Ukraine proposal is American plan, not Russian ‘wish list’





US President Donald Trump on Saturday said the US peace plan for ending the nearly four-year Russia-Ukraine war is “not my final offer” to Kyiv, suggesting the Thanksgiving deadline could be extended if progress is made in negotiations. The remarks hint at Washington’s intent to push for a settlement while leaving room for flexibility in talks, amid growing European concerns over elements seen as favouring Moscow.Speaking to the reporters in Washington, Trump said, “Ukraine war should have never happened; ""If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended one way or the other. We have to get it ended"" he added.On being asked if Zelensky rejects the plan, the US President said ""then he can continue to fight his little heart out.""The statement came as European, Canadian, and Japanese leaders at the G20 expressed concern that key elements of the plan including territorial concessions and caps on Ukraine’s armed forces could tilt the balance in Moscow’s favour noting that the draft contained “important elements” for a durable peace but would “require additional work”, citing worries about proposed border changes and limits on Ukraine’s armed forces, the BBC reported.President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukraine faced “one of the most difficult moments in our history” as pressure mounted to consider terms critics say favour Moscow.The US State Department on Saturday denied claims by a group of senators that the 28-point plan to end the Ukraine conflict was a “Russian wish list,” insisting that the proposal was authored by the United States, with input from both Kyiv and Moscow, AFP reported.State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said on X, “This is blatantly false. As Secretary Rubio and the entire Administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”The comments came after senators alleged earlier that President Donald Trump was promoting terms favourable to Russia in the ongoing peace discussions.The US proposal, according to ABC News, would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk currently under Kyiv control and accept de facto Russian control of Donetsk and Luhansk, along with recognition of Crimea’s 2014 annexation. It also envisages frozen front lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and would cap Ukraine’s military strength; one draft suggests a limit of about 600,000 personnel and deployment of Western fighter jets in neighbouring Poland.The White House has set a Thanksgiving deadline of November 27 for Kyiv to accept the plan and is sending a delegation to Geneva to begin detailed consultations. ABC reported the US team will include secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Army Secretary Daniel P. Driscoll; a separate meeting with Russian representatives is also planned.At the G20, leaders signed a joint statement noting the draft could be a basis for further work but underlining that “borders must not be changed by force” and expressing concern that proposed limits on Ukraine’s forces would leave it vulnerable to future attack, the BBC reported.Kerry-level and security officials from the UK, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine are due to meet in Geneva on Sunday, according to the BBC, as allies seek to reconcile the US text with Kyiv’s core demands for sovereignty and sufficient defence capability.This comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin cautiously welcomed the US peace plan for Ukraine, saying it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement,” while criticising Kyiv for opposing it, Reuters reported. Speaking at a meeting of Russia’s National Security Council on Friday, he described Ukraine’s stance as unrealistic.The plan, developed by the United States, incorporates several of Moscow’s long-standing demands, including territorial concessions, a reduction in the size of Ukraine’s armed forces, and a halt to NATO membership ambitions, while offering limited security guarantees. Putin added that although Russia had received the text, it “has not been discussed with us in any substantive way,” suggesting that Ukraine and its European allies “still dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield. Ukraine’s leadership, while saying it is prepared to negotiate, reiterated that any settlement must preserve Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Kyiv faces a “very difficult choice,” balancing the need to protect its national dignity against the risk of straining key international partnerships. Speaking to the nation, he said Ukraine would continue consultations with the United States and European allies to ensure any agreement is fair. Zelenskyy held a nearly hour-long discussion with US vice president JD Vance and army secretary Dan Driscoll to review the proposed peace plan, acknowledging the intense pressure facing his country.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump says peace plan is 'not my final offer' to Kyiv.

Power shift in Venezuela? US prepares new phase of operations; speculation grows over Nicolás Maduro’s removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/power-shift-in-venezuela-us-prepares-new-phase-of-operations-speculation-grows-over-nicols-maduros-removal/articleshow/125515061.cms,"Nicolás Maduro (AP image)

Trump’s EMERGENCY Warning To US Pilots Amid Tensions With Maduro: ‘Be Careful Over Venezuela’





The United States is preparing to launch a new phase of operations targeting Venezuela in the coming days, four US officials told Reuters, signalling a potential escalation in Washington’s efforts to challenge President Nicolás Maduro’s rule.The move comes as the Trump administration steps up pressure on Caracas, while expanding its military presence in the Caribbean, a buildup that has raised fresh concerns about a possible confrontation.According to two of the officials, covert operations are expected to be the first step of the new strategy. They said discussions include options that could aim to push Maduro from power. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the plans.Maduro, who has led Venezuela since 2013, has long accused the US of seeking to remove him from office. He maintains that citizens and the military are prepared to resist any foreign attempt to unseat him.A US military buildup near Venezuelan waters has been underway for months. The US Navy’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford arrived in the region on November 16 with its strike group, joining at least seven other warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 fighter aircraft.Although the Pentagon says forces are focused on counter-narcotics missions, the scale of deployment is significantly larger than needed for such operations.Washington has accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which it claims smuggles drugs into the US. On Monday, the Trump administration plans to designate the group a foreign terrorist organization, according to Reuters.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently said the designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States,” including potential strikes on Maduro’s assets and infrastructure.In anticipation of heightened risk, the US Federal Aviation Administration has warned airlines about a “potentially hazardous situation” over Venezuelan airspace, prompting multiple carriers to cancel flights.Since September, US troops have conducted at least 21 strikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people. These actions have been condemned by human-rights groups as illegal killings.Despite escalating pressure, President Trump has also expressed openness to negotiations.“At a certain period of time, I’ll be talking to him,” he told reporters at the White House when asked about speaking with Maduro. On a separate query about possible US strikes inside Mexico to combat drug cartels, Trump said: “It’s ok with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs… I’d be proud to do it.”Maduro has responded by saying he is ready for dialogue, stating he will meet “face to face” with anyone from the US who wants to talk. However, his government is also preparing for a potential US invasion, planning for “prolonged resistance” through guerrilla-style operations at more than 280 sites, according to sources cited by Reuters.The US military is vastly stronger than Venezuela’s, which continues to struggle with a collapse in training, equipment and food supplies for soldiers. In August, Washington doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million.Meanwhile, regional neighbors are attempting to avoid involvement. Trinidad and Tobago, located just 10 km from Venezuela has said it will not allow its territory to be used for any attack, despite US Marines conducting exercises there for the second time in a month.","The US is preparing to launch a new phase of operations targeting Venezuela in the coming days, four US officials told Reuters.

'Resistance Our Right': Hamas Rejects Gaza Stabilisation Force Proposal; Slams US Resolution At UNSC

Turkey, Qatar named in the statement









Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad has claimed that it uncovered a major Hamas-linked terror network operating across Europe, alleging that elements of the group’s leadership in Qatar were involved in steering the operations.Mossad, in a statement, said that the network was designed by Hamas to activate “on the day the order is given,” with European raids revealing weapons stockpiles that included handguns and explosive devices. One such cache was discovered last September during a joint operation by Austria’s State Security and Intelligence Directorate (DSN) in Vienna.""The investigation into the Hamas terror network in Europe is currently examining the possible involvement of Hamas elements in Turkey in promoting the intention to carry out attacks, some of which have been exposed,"" the statement said.""Law and enforcement authorities in Europe, including in Germany and Austria, have conducted a series of complex counter-terrorism operations, resulting in the arrest of terrorist operatives and the discovery of weapons caches intended for use by terrorist cells to harm innocent people 'on the day the order is given',"" it added.The investigation has also drawn attention to suspected Hamas activity in Turkey, which Mossad described as a longstanding “convenient operational arena.”German authorities arrested another alleged operative, Barah al-Khatib, last November after he reportedly travelled from Turkey following his activities in Europe.""This is due to Turkey being a convenient operational arena for Hamas operatives in the past and present. As part of the investigation by European security and enforcement bodies, a prominent operative in the infrastructure, Barah al-Khatib, was arrested in Germany last November, after having stayed in Turkey, apparently after completing his operational activity on European soil,"" it said.Investigators linked the weapons seized to Hamas operative Muhammad Na’im, son of senior Hamas political bureau member Basem Na’im. Mossad claimed the pair held a meeting in Qatar around the same period, suggesting that senior leadership based there had authorised the expansion of terror activity into Europe. It asserted that this contradicted public denials by Hamas leaders who reject accusations of external operations.""The involvement of the organization's leadership from Qatar in promoting terrorist activities is not being exposed for the first time, even though the movement's senior officials have repeatedly denied it publicly, as part of their effort to protect the image of the Hamas organization in the eyes of international public opinion,"" it said.","Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad has claimed that it uncovered a major Hamas- linked terror network operating across Europe.

Coup-case twist: Ex-Brazil president Bolsonaro detained over plot to flee before sentence; ‘ankle monitor breach’ triggered arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/coup-case-twist-ex-brazil-president-bolsonaro-detained-over-plot-to-flee-before-sentence-ankle-monitor-breach-triggered-arrest/articleshow/125514238.cms,"Photo credit: AP





Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was taken into custody early Saturday after a Supreme Court justice said his ankle monitor had been tampered with, prompting fears he might attempt to flee as supporters mobilised nearby, according to AP.Bolsonaro’s detention comes days before he was expected to begin serving a 27-year sentence for allegedly orchestrating a 2022 coup attempt, according to officials and his legal team. Acting on a Supreme Court request, federal police arrested him around 6 am and transferred him from his home in the upscale Jardim Botânico district to federal police headquarters, aide Andriely Cirino told AP. Local reports said the 70-year-old had exhausted all appeals and was expected to start his sentence next week.Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the post-election coup-attempt case, ordered federal police to enter Bolsonaro’s Brasília residence before dawn and move him to the federal police headquarters. De Moraes said data from the monitoring device showed a violation at 12.08 am, triggering a preventive arrest ahead of a planned rally called by Bolsonaro’s son later in the day.A custody report reviewed by AP, along with video submitted to the court, showed Bolsonaro admitting he tried to open the device with a soldering iron; the cap appeared heavily damaged.His legal team denied the allegation, saying the timeline “did not take place” as stated. A federal police representative confirmed to Reuters that the former leader underwent intake procedures on Saturday morning, ending several months of house arrest. He had been ordered to wear the device after being deemed a potential flight risk.De Moraes, in his order, said the attempt to breach the ankle monitor reinforced concerns that Bolsonaro might try to flee “amid the confusion” caused by the demonstration organised by his son. He also noted the proximity of the US embassy in Brasília, saying it lies just 13 km away — “a distance that can be covered in a 15-minute drive.” The judge cited previous instances of defendants and political allies of the former president leaving Brazil to avoid detention.Outside the federal police headquarters, small but vocal groups of both supporters and critics gathered, prompting officers to keep the opposing crowds apart, AP reported. The mobilisation began after Flávio Bolsonaro released a video urging people to show up at 7 pm, asking whether they would “fight for your country” or watch events unfold from home.According to Reuters, Bolsonaro was sentenced in September to 27 years and three months for plotting to stop President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from taking office in 2023, and identified as the central figure in the plan. Although convicted, he had not yet received a final arrest warrant as his appeals had not been exhausted. He has also been barred from running for public office until 2030.","Jair Bolsonaro was taken into custody early Saturday after a Supreme Court justice said his ankle monitor had been tampered with.

UK Speaker Loses Cool Over Starmer Govt Presser On Russian Ship Directing Lasers At British Pilots





UK prime minister Keir Starmer has hinted that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor may need to provide any ""relevant information"" he has to a US Congress investigation looking into the network of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , The Times reported.While speaking to reporters on his way to the G20 summit in Johannesburg, Starmer said that, in general, anyone who has knowledge about cases involving sexual offences should share that information with the authorities who are investigating.“A general principle I’ve held for a very long time is that anybody who has got relevant information in relation to these kinds of cases should give that evidence to those that need it. “That would be my general position on this.” Starmer said.According to The Times, he made clear he would not comment directly on Andrew’s case but noted that the decision ultimately rests with him. When pressed again, Starmer reiterated his longstanding position that anyone with relevant details “should be prepared to share it”.Starmer’s remarks followed Andrew’s failure to respond to the committee’s interview request, which drew sharp criticism from two of its members, mounting frustration within the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own inquiry into Epstein’s associates.According to The Times, Democratic members recently wrote to him requesting a transcribed interview regarding his long-standing association with Epstein.A separate letter from committee Democrats, reported by The Times, said Andrew’s “close relationship” with Epstein — combined with a recently revealed 2011 email in which Andrew wrote, “we are in this together” — suggested he may hold information valuable to their investigation. The panel cannot compel him to appear, as US lawmakers do not have jurisdiction over foreign nationals.According to The Guardian, Andrew has also not responded to a formal approach from the committee seeking cooperation, prompting members to say they would continue the probe “with or without his involvement”. The paper noted that newly released Epstein documents, totalling nearly 23,000 pages, reference Andrew dozens of times. One email cited in the release appears to confirm the authenticity of the photograph showing Andrew with Virginia Giuffre, an image he previously cast doubt on.Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles last month after renewed scrutiny over allegations made by Giuffre — which he denies — has faced increasing public and political pressure to address questions about his past links with Epstein. According to The Independent, US lawmakers Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam have publicly criticised his “silence”, saying survivors “deserve justice”.","Keir Starmer hints that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor may need to provide any ""relevant information"" he has to a US Congress investigation.

Candace Owens PRANKED Mid-Conspiracy: Falls for Bogus Tip Linking Plane to Kirk’s Death

Candace Owens says source connects Charlie Kirk killer to French Foreign Legion 13th Brigade





Candace Owens says she got very “serious” and “urgent” information from a French government source. She shared this on her X page on November 22, 2025. She wrote that this source told her that French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron want her dead. She also said the same danger is facing French journalist Xavier Poussard. Candace Owens wrote that the source told her a “small team” inside the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group was part of this plan, and one Israeli agent was also linked.She said the source reached out to her two days before she posted the message. She also said she checked the person’s job inside the French government and checked their ties to the Macron couple. She said the person shared proof of their work, and she felt the information was real. She asked people online to share her message because she did not know which American official she could trust.Candace Owens also said that the same source gave her another detail. She wrote that the man who was said to be guilty of killing Charlie Kirk had trained with the French Foreign Legion’s 13th Brigade. She said this shows what she called “multi-state involvement.”She again warned that the life of journalist Xavier Poussard was also in danger. She wrote that the French president “wants us both dead” and has used “professional units” for this.Candace Owens has been in a public fight with Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron for months. On July 23, 2025, the Macrons filed a 219-page defamation lawsuit in the Delaware Superior Court. The case is about her podcast series Becoming Brigitte. In that show, she claimed that Brigitte Macron was born as Jean-Michel Trogneux. She also said the couple did identity theft, incest, and mind-control acts.The Macrons said in their lawsuit that these stories are false. They said she shared them to grow her media fame, get attention, and make money. The complaint also says she called Brigitte Macron “a very goofy man” in one episode.Candace Owen's spokesperson, Mitchell Jackson, said the lawsuit was an attack on her First Amendment rights. He said it shows “a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist.”Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed",Candace Owens claims a French alert says the Macrons want her and Xavier Poussard dead in shocking Charlie Kirk murderer twist.

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"‘WATCH YOUR TONE!’: Leavitt FUMES After Ramaphosa 'Laughs' At Trump’s Last-minute G20 ‘Scramble’





South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott.

‘Sign NOW Or Suffer Later!’: US Threatens NATO To Pressure Ukraine Into Signing Russia Peace Deal





The US state department on Saturday rejected claims that its 28-point plan to end the Ukraine war was a “Russian wish list.” The denial came after a group of senators said they were told by secretary of state Marco Rubio that President Donald Trump was pushing a plan shaped by Moscow.State department spokesman Tommy Pigott said on X that the allegation was “blatantly false,” adding that the plan was written by the United States with inputs from both Russia and Ukraine.Pigott was responding to Republican senator Mike Rounds' claim that secretary of state Rubio told him the document was a proposal passed on to a US representative, not a plan drafted by the US, reported News Hour.Rounds reportedly said that the plan was shared as an intermediary and later leaked, not released by lawmakers. According to Rounds, the proposal was handed over by someone claiming to represent Russia and delivered to Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East.Senator Angus King also said the leaked document appeared to reflect Russian demands, not the administration’s position. ""The leaked 28-point plan, which, according to secretary Rubio, is not of the administration's position--it is essentially the wish list of the Russians,"" he said.Earlier, CBS News reported that Western leaders were concerned because the proposal contained several Russian conditions and provided only limited assurances regarding Ukraine’s sovereignty and security.The plan has triggered concern in Kyiv and across Europe. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country now faced a difficult choice between protecting its sovereign rights and maintaining crucial American support.President Trump has asked Zelenskyy to respond to the plan by Thursday, with the possibility of an extension. He told reporters that the proposal was not his final offer and repeated his view that the war should never have happened.On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Moscow had received the text of the 28-point plan through its usual communication channels with Washington.Ukrainian officials will meet a US delegation in Switzerland to discuss the plan.","US state department rejects claims that its 28-point plan to end Ukraine war was a ""Russian wish list"" The denial came after a group of senators said they were told by secretary of state Marco Rubio that President Donald Trump was pushing a plan shaped by Moscow.

'Tampering, destroying, or selectively releasing files'

“The American people understandably have concerns about the President using his political influence over the files’ release and either tampering, destroying, or selectively releasing and withholding files, particularly in light of the Department of Justice’s announcement to start investigating Democrats who were associated with Epstein.”

Previous statement

“I just voted YES to release the Epstein files to the public, but we didn’t need this vote. The Oversight Committee subpoenaed these files months ago, and the President could have just released them. While we already have the files released by the Epstein Estate, the FBI and DOJ are sitting on tens of thousands more.""

“The brave survivors, and the American people, deserve the truth. For too long, powerful and rich people have evaded accountability for their association with Jeffrey Epstein. As a member of the House Oversight Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues to conduct a full, thorough investigation, and finally hold those who committed heinous crimes against girls accountable.”





Indian American Congressman Suhas Subramanyam has written to FBI Director Kash Patel, urging the bureau to ensure the security of released Jeffrey Epstein files and investigate potential political interference or tampering.Subramanyam is a member of the House Oversight Committee. He, along with many other Democrats, is concerned about President Trump’s influence in handling the documents.In the letter, Subramanyam wrote,The Congressman’s request follows “concerning anecdotal reports” suggesting possible tampering, including claims that an acting deputy chief at the Department of Justice indicated all Republican names were being redacted, according to New India Abroad. He also cited statements by Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein on NewsNation alleging that Trump administration officials were “scrubbing the files to take Republican names out” and that the Justice Department’s shift in approach was linked to sabotage of the original files.“These reports do nothing to inspire confidence of a complete release of all of the Epstein files, no matter the political affiliation of the people named,” Subramanyam wrote, adding that victims and their families “deserve full justice and accountability.”Subramanyam asked the FBI to clarify by the weekend that who will be responsible for redacting and approving changes to the files, whether Attorney General Bondi had physical possession of the documents earlier this year, and what security measures are in place at the FBI’s Central Records Complex. He also requested an in-person visit to Winchester or any other facility where relevant files are stored. Additionally, he enquired whether any Epstein-related records have been accessed, altered, or tampered with since January 20, the day Trump assumed office for his second term.The Congressman spoke last week after the House passed the bill mandating the Department of Justice to release all unclassified Epstein-related documents within 30 days. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on November 19. The Justice Department has said it will comply “with maximum transparency.""Subramanyam also discussed the need for accountability and transparency in a statement last week after voting for the release of Epstein files.","Indian American Congressman Suhas Subramanyam has written to FBI Director Kash Patel, urging the bureau to ensure the security of released Jeffrey Epstein files.

Sarah Hurwitz, former chief speechwriter for Michelle Obama and a senior speechwriter for President Barack Obama, has called for Jewish schools to ban smartphones until senior year, arguing that constant exposure to graphic images from Gaza is both traumatising for children and seriously undermining efforts to explain Israel’s position to younger generations.Speaking at the Z3 Conference, a major Jewish leadership gathering, Hurwitz warned that social media feeds filled with footage of dead and injured Palestinian children are creating an emotional shock that “makes it impossible” for her to defend Israel’s actions in conversations with young people.“I’m talking through a wall of dead children,” she said, describing how the raw, unfiltered imagery circulating on TikTok and Instagram instantly shapes young people’s views before any political context or explanation can be offered. According to Hurwitz, these images not only drown out pro-Israel arguments but also expose children to trauma they are not psychologically ready to handle.She argued that temporarily restricting smartphone access in Jewish schools would protect students’ mental health while giving educators space to discuss the conflict without the immediate influence of distressing, algorithm-driven content.Hurwitz previously worked as a speechwriter for Barack and Michelle Obama and has since been involved in Jewish community discussions, often commenting on how younger audiences engage with issues of identity and Israel.

Allegedly wielding a metal fork as a weapon, he reportedly assaulted two teenagers mid-flight, prompting an emergency diversion to the U.S.





A 28-year-old Indian national has been indicted in Boston after allegedly stabbing two 17-year-old passengers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt last month. The incident forced the plane to divert to the United States, according to the Justice Department.Federal prosecutors said Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli had entered the country on a student visa but no longer had lawful status. He now faces two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while travelling on an aircraft. A federal grand jury returned the indictment on Thursday. He has been detained since his arrest on October 27 and will be arraigned in Boston at a later date.According to charging documents, the incident unfolded on October 25 on Lufthansa flight 431 shortly after meal service. Prosecutors said one of the victims, identified as Minor A, was sleeping in a middle seat when he awoke to see Usiripalli standing over him. Usiripalli allegedly “used his right hand to strike Minor A in the left clavicle area with a metal fork.”He then turned to a second teenager seated nearby. “Usiripalli then allegedly lunged toward Minor B … and struck Minor B in the back of his head with the fork,” prosecutors said.Minor B suffered a laceration to the back of his head.Prosecutors said the situation escalated when flight crew attempted to intervene. Usiripalli allegedly “raised his hand, formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled an imaginary trigger.” He then “turned toward a female passenger and slapped her with his hand” and also tried to slap a crew member.The violence forced the pilots to divert the aircraft to Boston Logan International Airport, where law enforcement officers took him into custody as soon as the plane landed.Usiripalli had previously been admitted to the United States on a student visa and was enrolled in a master’s programme in biblical studies. However, authorities confirmed he no longer held lawful immigration status at the time of the alleged assault.If convicted, he faces up to ten years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The case is being prosecuted by the US Attorney’s Office in Boston, with assistance from the FBI, Massachusetts State Police, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection.Prosecutors said that the details in the charging documents remain allegations. Usiripalli is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court.In a statement, the US Attorney’s Office confirmed that “the non-citizen individual was living unlawfully in the United States at the time of the offence.” Federal prosecutors described","Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, allegedly stabbed two 17-year-old passengers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt last month.
