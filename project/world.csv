DEHRADUN/PITHORAGARH: India's chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar , and Uttarakhand 's additional chief electoral officer, Vijay Kumar Jogdande, were rescued from a remote village in Pithoragarh and brought to Munsiyari on Thursday morning, 17 hours after their helicopter, en route to Milam Glacier , made an emergency landing in Ralam village, 42km away at an altitude of 12,000 feet, due to bad weather.The two officials spent the night in an empty house in the deserted village without adequate woollens, huddled around a bonfire with instant noodles for dinner, enduring sub-zero temperatures until rescue teams arrived.The duo, along with the pilot, was spotted wandering in sub-zero temperatures by a trekker from Bengaluru and his two porters, who opened an uninhabited house in Ralam village.

Noida School Molestation :'Don’t tell anyone at home': 3-year-old ‘molested twice’ in Noida school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/a-predator-targeted-my-daughter-twice-mother-speaks-out-after-sexual-assault-at-on-student-at-noida-school/articleshow/114298170.cms,"Representative Image

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NOIDA: A three-year-old student who was sexually assaulted allegedly by a housekeeping staffer of a frontline school’s junior wing on campus earlier this month was molested by the same man a few weeks ago, the child’s mother told TOI on Wednesday, pointing to the serious lapse that allowed a predator to target her daughter twice and questioning the school management’s attitude and response since she incident came to light.On Oct 4, the school worker had allegedly taken the child to the school’s medical room, locked its doors and sexually abused the child, the mother said.He allegedly leapt out of the window and fled when another staffer — a ‘didi’ — came looking on hearing the child’s scream. The mother claimed the child was eventually escorted back to her class by a teacher, but when asked about the incident, her imputation was that the girl may have seen some inappropriate videos online.She said her daughter refused to go to school on Oct 7 and complained of pain in her private parts. “We took her to a paediatrician and the doctor wrote some tests to check for infection. The next day, the doctor told us that there was no infection, but the child had been sexually assaulted,” she said.After counselling, the child told her parents that a man who served food to the kids at school — referring to him as ‘khana bhaiya’ — had pricked her private parts with a stick when she went to school on Oct 4.“‘Bhaiya danda karte hai’ she kept repeating. That’s when she told us that this was the second time that he had done so. A few weeks back, the same man molested the child when she was on a slide in the school’s playground,” the mother said.The child, she added, told them that she had reported the incident to her class teacher, but was told ‘gharpe mat batana’ (don’t tell anyone at home about the incident).“I called up the class teacher on Oct 8 and asked her about the two incidents. To my surprise, the teacher tried to brush away the incident and said that my daughter may have watched an inappropriate video online and may be telling the events as her own. I was taken aback, and asked the teacher that watching a video would not give my daughter pain, redness, and rashes in her private parts,” the mother said, adding she went to the police after this.The family submitted a complaint at Sector 20 police station the same day and an FIR was registered on Oct 9. The child’s statement was recorded before the Child Welfa re Committee (CWC) and she identified the accused from a set of pictures shown to her by the cops as a part of the probe. Subsequently, the 30-year-old housekeeping staffer was arrested from Nithari village on Oct 10 under BNS Section 65(2) (rape of a woman under 12 years). CWC member Dipti Yadav said the committee served a notice to the school and summoned the headmistress on Wednesday.The school’s headmistress, meanwhile, told TOI they got to know about the alleged sexual assault when a police team visited the school on Oct 9. “The parents did not talk to us about the incident before this,” she said.Deputy CP Rambadan Singh said in their complaint the parents did not mention the class teacher was informed about the incident earlier.The family said that they would withdraw their child from the school.","A three-year-old student who was sexually assaulted allegedly by a housekeeping staffer of a frontline school’s junior wing on campus earlier this month was molested by the same man a few weeks ago.

"Trudeau lying to distract from his party's revolt, says his main opponent & Conservative leader",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trudeau-lying-to-distract-from-his-partys-revolt-says-his-main-opponent-conservative-leader/articleshow/114327730.cms,"Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has come under attack back home, with his main opponent, Conservative Party 's Pierre Poilievre , accusing him of lying and winning two elections with China's help while making misleading claims about India's interference in Ottawa's internal affairs.Responding to Trudeau's allegation about links of Conservative MPs to foreign powers, Poilievre said the PM had not responded to his message to reveal the names of MPs who collaborated with "" foreign interference "".""Justin Trudeau is doing what he always does: he is lying. He is lying to distract from a Liberal caucus revolt against his leadership and revelations he knowingly allowed Beijing to interfere and help him win two elections,"" said the Conservative politician who enjoys nearly a double-digit lead in ratings over Trudeau in the build-up to polls next year.Poilievre also revealed that Trudeau, who through his senior aides conveyed to him serious allegations of India's interference in Canada 's internal affairs, had not backed up the charge though the law allows him the leeway to share the specific details. ""I was briefed on Oct 14 by Nathalie Drouin, national security and intelligence advisor to the PM; David Morrison, deputy minister of foreign affairs at Global Affairs Canada; and Daniel Rogers, director of CSIS; about the matter of foreign interference from India,"" Poilievre said, adding that Trudeau's team did not share details with him by taking the stand that they could not put any MP in a ""tough position"" without giving them due process. Poilievre said the stand of Trudeau's aides was just an excuse as ""CSIS Act allows the govt to offer any information to any Canadian about specific risks of foreign interference without forcing them into sworn secrecy or controlling what they say"".He also said it was the first time Trudeau's team had made the claim about India's interference and its links to Conservative MPs. The timing, Oct 14, of the Trudeau team's visit to Poilievre is also significant: it came on the eve of the deposition of the PM and members of PMO before the Foreign Interference Commission, the coincidence set to strengthen India's suspicion that the dispensation in Ottawa fired the second volley of allegations to distract attention from the hearings into charge that Trudeau allowed the Chinese a free run of his country.""If Trudeau has evidence to the contrary, he should share it with the public. Now that he has blurted it out in general terms at a commission of inquiry, he should release facts. But he won't, because he is making it up,"" Poilievre said.","Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has come under attack back home.

SC acquits death row convict who spent 12 years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-acquits-death-row-convict-who-spent-12-years-in-jail/articleshow/114328658.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday acquitted a death row convict who spent 12 years in jail out of which eight years were under the shadow of death for allegedly killing his wife, mother and two-year-old daughter in 2012 in Pune. It found that there was no conclusive evidence to prove his guilt and directed his release from jail.A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Prashant Kumar Mishra and K V Viswanathan set aside an order of the trial court and Bombay HC which awarded death sentence after holding him guilty in the triple murder case .After analysing and evaluating all the evidence, the bench found them to be not enough to convict him and held that a person cannot be held guilty merely on the basis of suspicion.“It is settled law that suspicion, however strong it may be, cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt... An accused is presumed innocent unless proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt,” the bench said. The trial court and HC convicted him on the basis of the statement of a neighbour but SC said it was full of contradictions and the circumstantial evidence was also not convincing to draw a conclusion of guilt.""...it is necessary for the prosecution that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established. The Court held that it is a primary principle that the accused ‘must be’ and not merely ‘may be’ proved guilty before a court can convict the accused. It has been held that there is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between ‘may be proved’ and ‘must be or should be proved’. It has been held that the facts so established should be consistent only with the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except the one where the accused is guilty. It has further been held that the circumstances should be such that they exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved,"" Justice Gavai, who penned the judgement for the bench, said.","A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Prashant Kumar Mishra and K V Viswanathan set aside an order of the trial court and Bombay HC which awarded death sentence after holding him guilty in the triple murder case.

Sabotage led to Bagmati Express crash: Probe report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sabotage-led-to-bagmati-express-crash-probe-report/articleshow/114326659.cms,"CHENNAI: An official inquiry into the Mysuru-Darbhanga Bagmati Express accident has indicated sabotage , confirming that nuts and bolts were removed from the track, causing the train to veer off the main track on to the loop line and ram into a stationary goods train at Kavaraipettai railway station on Oct 11. Twelve coaches were derailed and 20 people injured in the accident.On Thursday, 15 railway personnel, including the trackman, loco pilot of the train and Kavaraipettai station master appeared before the Commissioner for Rail Safety A M Chowdhary.They ruled out technical fault and confirmed that the nuts and bolts on the track were unfastened. However, the report was kept confidential.GRP assistant commissioner Karnan told TOI that the trackman had confirmed that six bolts and nuts were removed. Karnan told the police that it would take at least 30 minutes for an experienced person to do this; with a hand-held power gadget, it would take 15 to 20 minutes. ""The trackman was on duty from 7am to 5 pm on Oct 11, and he found no suspicious activity on the tracks during that time. After that, there was no other person assigned to check the tracks,"" he added.The sabotage is believed to have been carried out just before an EMU train passed through at 8.26pm. With the nuts and bolts removed, the track loosened further with the passage of the EMU train. As a result, the Bagmati Express, which arrived 12 minutes later, moved to the loop line - a track that branches out from the main route and merges with it again after a short distance.""The loco pilot of Bagmati Express confirmed that he saw the green signal. However, he was clueless about how the train moved to the loop line.

TOI Correspondent from LONDON: Straight after a huge diplomatic crisis engulfed India and Canada on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought support from Britain, one of its Five Eyes allies.Trudeau rang UK PM Keir Starmer in the evening to discuss what he described as a “targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the govt of India”.Trudeau said the leaders discussed the need to ensure the safety and security of their citizens and the importance of upholding and respecting the rule of law and that he underscored Canada’s “continued interest in cooperation with India”. The No. 10 statement on the call, which was more reserved, said they spoke about “allegations” under investigation in Canada and “agreed on the importance of the rule of law”.Dabinderjit Singh, lead executive for political engagement at the pro-Khalistan Sikh Federation UK, said the allegations against India should be a “wake-up call to the UK govt, the other Five Eyes nations and countries across the globe” and called on other countries to “show the same courage and political will to stand shoulder to shoulder with Canada”.When news of the crisis broke, a newly formed Sikh Federation International was busy briefing 10 UK MPs and Baroness Warsi on the transnational repression of Sikhs in a committee room in the UK Parliament. The meeting was chaired by Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill.The barrister representing Avtar Singh Khanda's family, Michal Polak, was at the meeting, as were two Canadian Sikhs from Sikh Federation Canada — Moninder Singh, who is giving evidence about India to the ongoing public inquiry in Canada into foreign interference in the electoral process, and Prabjot Singh, the lead advocate representing Sikhs at that inquiry. Moninder has received multiple threat to life warnings in Canada.The Canadian activists informed the parliamentarians that “the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh leader, on Canadian soil and India’s arrogance that they could get literally get away with murder had resulted in the political will in Canada to expose India on the international stage for having no respect for the rule of law and Canada’s sovereignty”. Nijjar was designated a terrorist by India.Polak told them he is calling for an inquest and a public inquiry into Khanda’s death.

His family and friends are convinced he was poisoned by India’s govt.Next, the US-based Sikhs for Justice, which is banned in India and is organising an unofficial Khalistan referendum, announced it had allocated a $500,000 budget to “track” the ex-high commissioner of India to Canada, Sanjay Verma, “in pursuit of bringing him to justice” for his alleged role in the “assassination” of Nijjar.The MEA on Monday withdrew Verma and other targeted diplomats and officials from Canada, after they were named as “persons of interest” in Nijjar’s murder by Canada’s govt. The MEA said their lives had been endangered and branded the allegations “preposterous”.The flare-up in relations came after deputy commissioner of federal policing Mark Flynn travelled to Singapore with Canadian national security and intelligence adviser Nathalie Drouin and deputy minister of foreign affairs David Morrison to present what Canada described as “evidence” of the Indian govt’s involvement in “serious criminal activity in Canada” to govt officials from India on Oct 12.The meeting did not go as planned and the RCMP said that because India would not cooperate it decided to go public.At a press briefing, RCMP assistant commissioner Brigitte Gauvin then made astonishing allegations that a “number of criminal gangs” were working for the Indian govt in Canada and one of them is the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, originating in India, to carry out extortions, threats, homicides and other acts of violence. “There is specific targetingof pro-Khalistan elementsin Canada,” Gauvin alleged.She said Canadian police had around a dozen police investigations ongoing “with links to the govt of India” and around 30 individuals had been arrested and charged with extortion and homicides. Since Sept 2023, 13 people in Canada have received duty to warn notices, she said, adding RCMP had shared this information with the FBI and other Five Eyes allies.","Canadian PM Justin Trudeau sought support from Britain, one of its Five Eyes allies.

Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5pm local time warning of an ""aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol"", it added.The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call saying they had ""a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol. He's destroying the entire room."" The manager's voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, said authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death. Payne had been vocal about struggling with alcoholism , posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne didn't return calls.Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series ""The X Factor "" in 2010, two years after Payne's first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Buble's version of ""Cry Me a River"".After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands - even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne - who hailed from Wolverhampton, a city in the West Midlands region of England - being known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and hits like ""What Makes You Beautiful,"" ""Night Changes"" and ""Story of My Life."" They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016.After the group's dissolution, Payne - like each of his erstwhile bandmates - pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

Donald Trump , who has become the oldest candidate to run for president post, has said that ""only stupid people put old"" people in position for the Supreme Court . He seems to have forgotten his age.In an interview with Bloomberg in Chicago , Trump said, ""It’s amazing because I got three in four years. Most people get none. Because, you know, you put them in, they’re young.You tend to put them in young.""See Video:""Only stupid people put old you know you don't put old in because they're there for two years or three years so I got three,"" he added.During his term, Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch was 49 years old when he started, Brett Kavanaugh was 53 years old and Amy Coney Barrett was 48, which are relatively younger than the previous appointments.When the interviewer pointed out Trump's own advanced age, he appeared to dodge the question and instead focused on his successful appointments. He said, ""I think they've been great choices too but I got threejudges and and and you know what they want to do they want to put up they want to now put up up to 25 justices into the Supreme Court, the radical left.""While appointing judges for Supreme Court, Trump suggested people younger than him and he is currently the oldest nominee for president in US history. If elected in November, Trump would be 82 years old when he completes his term in 2029.His age has become a little concern in this election. Trump's mental and health fitness have ramped up on the campaign trail as he has frequently gone on long rants at rallies, ignored or missed questions and, at a Monday town hall, spent the majority of time dancing to music instead of answering questions.Clinical psychologist Dr. Ben Michaelis expressed concerns about Trump's cognitive abilities in an interview with The Independent. Michaelis mentioned the term ""sundowning,"" a symptom associated with dementia that makes it challenging to maintain focus, particularly as the day progresses.""It's very difficult for them to maintain focus on a topic. The idea of being able to maintain that level of focus for that amount of time, that late in the day…you wouldn't think twice about it if that was your grandfather.

'Chief obstacle'

No comfort, no compromise

JERUSALEM/CAIRO: Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said ""the spirit of resistance will be strengthened"" after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war , was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict.Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned.""Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,"" Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday.""To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.""Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades.He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by Israeli troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said.The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building.Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops.Despite Western hopes of a ceasefire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown.Israel has launched a ground campaign in Lebanon over the past month and is now planning a response to an Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.US President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home.The US wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the ""chief obstacle"" to ending the war.""That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,"" he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said.Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. ""The spirit of resistance will be strengthened"" following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said.Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing ""the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel"".US secretary of state Antony Blinken held separate phone calls on Thursday with leaders in Saudi Arabia and Qatar aimed at ending the conflict in the Middle East, the State Department said.Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza.Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that ""the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.""""A little justice, but no comfort,"" he said. ""There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home.""In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue.""This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,"" he said.

North Korean leader stresses troops to treat South Korea as hostile foreign enemy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korean-leader-stresses-troops-to-treat-south-korea-as-hostile-foreign-enemy/articleshow/114332260.cms,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left on red carpet, visits the headquarters of the North Korean People’s Army’s 2nd Corps at an undisclosed place in North Korea Thursday, October 17, 2024. (AP)

SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reminded his troops to treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy and insisted that the North wouldn't hesitate to attack its rival if the South infringes upon its sovereignty, state media said Friday. Kim's comments at an army headquarters came after North Korea this week confirmed that it revised its constitution to define South Korea as ""a hostile state"" and blew up front-line road and rail links that were once connected to the South.The steps punctuated Kim's calls for North Korea to abandon its longstanding goals of reconciling with the South and reflect his intent to escalate tensions and increase leverage amid a deepening stalemate in diplomacy. Analysts see increasing risks of possible clashes along the rivals' tense border areas, although it would be highly unlikely for the North to contemplate full-scale attacks in the face of superior US and South Korean forces.Also read: North Korea revises Constitution, declares South Korea as 'hostile State' During a visit to the headquarters of the North Korean People's Army's 2nd Corps on Thursday, Kim stressed to troops the importance of understanding that any use of offensive force against the South would constitute a ""legitimate retaliatory action against the hostile country, not the fellow countrymen.""He said the North's detonation of the border road and rail sections on Tuesday demonstrated the North's resolve to cut off persistent ""evil"" relations with the South, which ""lasted century after century and the complete removal of the useless awareness about fellow countrymen and unreasonable idea of reunification.""He said the event was also a declaration that his troops wouldn't hesitate to use physical force against the South, an ""apparent hostile country,"" if it violates North Korea's sovereignty, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.South Korea had no immediate comment on Kim's remarks.North Korea has been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea in recent weeks, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang this month and threatening to attack if it happens again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face an overwhelming response that would ""end its regime"" if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022, as Kim used Russia's war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told the Associated Press earlier this month that North Korea will likely attempt to ramp up pressure with major provocations around the US presidential elections in November, possibly including a long-range missile test or a nuclear test detonation, to grab Washington's attention.",North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reminded his troops to treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy.

Kamala Harris Fox News Interview: Kamala Harris vows to be different than Joe Biden in fiery Fox interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-vows-to-be-different-than-joe-biden-in-fiery-fox-interview/articleshow/114298692.cms,"Harris's first formal interview with Fox News ran for nearly half an hour.

Vice President Kamala Harris sought to deflect criticism over the administration’s handling of the border crisis, her stance on transgender rights and her ties to President Joe Biden in a combative interview Wednesday on Fox News .“Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency, and like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas,” Harris said.The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour, capping a day where Harris sought to broaden her appeal to conservative voters with an event in suburban Philadelphia featuring dozens of Republican officials who had endorsed her campaign. The interview between Harris and Fox chief political anchor Bret Baier was frequently testy, with both frequently interrupting and speaking over each other.Baier opened the interview by pressing Harris on immigration , which voters have pegged as one of the defining issues of the election.Harris argued that the administration has taken the issue of immigration seriously and that many of the problems they were facing pre-dated her and Biden taking office, and hit at Trump for his role in blocking a bipartisan bill that would have surged resources to address the border surge.“We’ve had a broken immigration system transcending by the way Donald Trump ’s administration even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system,” she said.The vice president said she and Biden had offered legislation to address the immigration system within hours of taking office.“Our focus has been on fixing a problem,” she said.But Baier pressed Harris on the number of undocumented migrants who had entered the country in recent years, and confronted Harris with a video clip of a family member blaming the Biden-Harris administration for the death of a woman murdered by someone in the country illegally.Asked if she would apologize to that family, Harris responded that they were “tragic cases.”“I am so sorry for her loss. I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely,” Harris added. “I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.”But she also insisted that Trump had stymied efforts to find a bipartisan solution to the problem, saying: “Let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions.”During the interview, Baier also played an advertisement from the Trump campaign attacking Harris for statements during the 2020 presidential campaign in which she said she would use taxpayer dollars to pay for gender transition surgeries for prisoners.Harris responded by noting a recent New York Times report that federal prisoners had received gender affirming care during Trump’s administration.“I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing you know stones when you’re living in a glass house,” Harris said. “I will follow the law, and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”While Harris earned plaudits from supporters who applauded her vigorous exchange with Baier, one moment during the exchanged seemed destined to become fodder in future campaign ads.When the Fox News host defended Trump by saying the Republican didn’t actively advocate the treatment for transgender inmates, Harris said candidates had to take responsibility “for what happened in your administration.”The line could provide a convenient soundbite for Trump at a moment Harris’ campaign is seeking distance from Biden. Harris devoted significant time during the Fox interview to arguing she represented “a new generation of leadership,” after earning criticism for saying during an interview with The View last week that she could not think of a decision she would have approached differently than the current president.Still, asked what voters should turn the page from - particularly with polls showing many unhappy with the direction of the country — Harris focused her response toward her opponent: “The last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump.”","The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour. The interview between Harris and Fox chief political anchor Bret Baier was frequently testy, with both frequently interrupting and speaking over each other. The vice president said she and Biden had offered legislation to address the immigration system within hours of taking office.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114298697,imgsize-73778,width-400,resizemode-4/114298697.jpg"
Sean Diddy List: Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-list-names-of-celebrities-connected-to-sean-combs-viral/articleshow/113609942.cms,"No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

'Don't want to have that experience again': China says it prefers Kamala Harris over Trump as US president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-want-to-have-that-experience-again-china-says-it-prefers-kamala-harris-over-trump-as-us-president/articleshow/114332562.cms,"Kamala Harris (left), and Donald Trump

A senior member of the Chinese national advisory body, Jia Qingguo , said on Thursday that China would prefer Kamala Harris over Donald Trump as the next US president, considering the deterioration of bilateral ties during the latter's presidency, which led to serious confrontation.Although the Chinese government refrains from commenting on the US presidential election to avoid accusations of interfering in American domestic politics, Jia, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), shared his views while talking to BBC.""I would prefer Harris because of the bad experience with Trump. We don't want to have that experience again,"" Jia said. However, the views of the Chinese general public are divided over Harris and Trump, he added.He said that during Trump's presidency, relations between the two countries declined sharply, resulting in serious confrontation. From China's perspective, Jia noted that ""US vice president Kamala Harris, who has worked under President Biden, represents the continuity.""Jia, who also serves as the director of the Institute of Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University, pointed out that Trump was quite emotional and spread a lot of misinformation about China during his presidency.While acknowledging that China has ""problems with the Biden admiration too"", Jia noted that Biden inherited many tough measures initiated by Trump against China.However, he said that under Biden, US policy towards China is more stable and predictable, with officials from both sides re-engaging and discussing issues, which helps stabilize the relationship.Despite following a tough policy towards China, including challenging Beijing's claims over the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan, and restricting China's ambitious move to export its electric vehicles, Joe Biden has maintained regular dialogue with China's President Xi Jinping to keep tensions under control.The relations between the two top economies hit a low point under Trump, particularly after the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan in 2019. Trump alleged that the virus responsible for the pandemic leaked from a bio lab in Wuhan, prompting China to launch a massive propaganda campaign to counter his accusations.Trump's threat to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods if he gets elected is a concern for Beijing, as it may severely impact China's economy, which is already experiencing a slowdown. The former president had levied tariffs on flourishing Chinese exports to the US to force Beijing to provide more access to American goods.The Biden administration continues to maintain these tariffs, with Chinese exports to the US amounting to over $500 billion last year, compared to around $148 billion in American exports to China.","Jia Qingguo, a senior member of the Chinese national advisory body, said on Thursday that China would prefer Kamala Harris over Donald Trump as the next US president.

Speaking at an event organised by the America PAC , Musk warned that four more years of a Democratic administration could lead to a permanent one-party state, akin to California.“I think if there's four more years of sort of the sort of puppet regime, they're actually going to legalise so many illegals in the swing states that there won't be swing states anymore,” he said at a rally in Philadelphia, urging the audience to vote early in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.""Anyone who is against those things is fundamentally anti-American,"" he said, igniting a strong reaction from the audience. Despite Musk's passionate plea for early voting, some attendees expressed confusion, questioning why they should vote early. When one supporter shouted ""Why?"" Musk did not provide a clear answer.Among the audience, concerns over election integrity were prevalent. John and Linda Bird, who attended the rally, expressed hesitation about early voting. John planned to vote on Election Day, while Linda noted the unpredictability of events on that day, saying, “Anything can happen.”Musk’s rally also touched on voter fraud , an issue Trump has frequently highlighted despite a lack of evidence. Musk sarcastically referenced Dominion voting machines, which have been at the centre of conspiracy theories, hinting at their use in key battleground states.Musk’s newfound political activism is notable, as he stated, “I haven't been politically active before. I'm politically active now because I think the future of America and the future of civilisation is at stake.”As part of his commitment to support Trump, Musk has pledged over $70 million to the America PAC, which is focused on mobilising Republican voters, particularly those who typically do not vote. Trump’s campaign strategy has shifted towards energising this base rather than courting independents or moderates, indicating a high-stakes election ahead in November.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk held his first solo rally in support of Donald Trump on Thursday.

I said, ‘No, no, we’re totally in favor of IVF.’”“So, I got a call from Katie Britt, a young, just a fantastically attractive person from Alabama. She’s a senator. And she called me up like, ‘Emergency, emergency,’ because an Alabama judge had ruled that the IVF clinics were illegal and they have to be closed down – a judge ruled. And she said, ‘Friends of mine came up to me and they were, oh, they were so angry. I didn’t even know they were going.’ You know, they were, it was fertilization” Trump said.“I didn’t know they were even involved in, nobody talks about that, they don’t talk about it. But now that they can’t do it, she said, ‘I was attacked.’ In a certain way, ‘I was attacked,’ he added.Social media users reacted strongly to a clip of Trump's remarks, labeling him a ""misogynist"" and ""creepy."" Many criticized his focus on Britt's appearance, arguing that it was irrelevant and that all women matter, regardless of their physical attributes.According to a report in The Independent, Trump's campaign national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, defended the former president, stating that he is ""loved by millions of women across the country"" and that those who know him personally would describe him as ""supportive, generous, and kind.""Abortion and IVF have become crucial issues in the current election. While Trump claims to support fertility treatment, Democrats caution that the overturning of Roe v Wade and the rollback of abortion rights could lead Republicans to target IVF access next. In February, Alabama's state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos had the same rights as children, causing some IVF clinics in the state to suspend treatment.",Former US President Donald Trump came under fire after he complimented a female senator's physical appearance as “young” and “fantastically attractive” in his attempt to garner women votes.

There's never been (anyone).""""And that doesn't mean I don't want to help him, because I feel very badly for those people.

However, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal last month, the war has claimed the lives of or wounded a million soldiers on both sides.As one of Ukraine's primary supporters, the United States has provided Zelensky's government with more than $64.1 billion in military assistance since the beginning of the conflict.Despite Kyiv being a US ally and Moscow being considered an adversary, Trump highlighted his positive relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin during a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky in September.It is worth noting that Trump faced impeachment for withholding crucial weaponry from Ukraine following Russia's smaller-scale invasion in 2014, as he pressured its government to announce investigations into Biden, who was then his election rival.Furthermore, a federal investigation uncovered numerous connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, which was found to have interfered in the 2016 US election to benefit the Republican candidate.Criticism surrounding Trump's apparent closeness to Putin intensified last week due to allegations that, while serving as president, he sent the Russian leader Covid tests despite a shortage in the US, and that Trump and Putin may have been in contact numerous times since 2021.","Former US president Donald Trump blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia.

'She’s not as strong ... ’: What Biden and Obama talked about Kamala Harris in an off-mic conversation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shes-not-as-strong-as-me-what-biden-and-obama-talked-about-kamala-harris-in-an-off-mic-conversation/articleshow/114326147.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden and Barack Obama were reportedly seen engaging in a private conversation over Vice President Kamala Harris' strength as Presidential candidate for the upcoming US elections.According to the New York Post , President Biden, in an off-mic conversation caught on camera, complained to former President Barack Obama that ""she"" is ""not as strong as me."" Former President Barack Obama agreed with Biden's assessment and responded, ""I know … that's true,"" and added, ""We have time."" Biden responded, ""Yeah, we'll get it in time.""Earlier in the conversation, Obama mentioned, ""it's important that we have some time together,"" possibly alluding to campaigning alongside Harris.The dialogue was translated by Jeremy Freeman, a London-based forensic lip reader who has served as a certified expert witness for 16 years.The exchange, which took place during Ethel Kennedy 's memorial service, was deciphered by Jeremy Freeman, a professional lip reader. Freeman noted that the conversation was supportive and lacked any tension between the two presidents, despite speculation based on Obama's head-shaking gesture.Meanwhile, Democratic sources had mixed reactions to the translation. Some believed it was an honest assessment of the 2024 race, while others expressed disbelief and questioned the accuracy of the script. One source noted the widespread concern that Harris was not a strong alternative to Biden, who was seen as a ""sinking ship."" Two former Biden White House officials working to support Harris' candidacy were stunned by the translation and doubted its accuracy, the New York post reported.“Democrats essentially robbed Peter to pay Paul and are now stuck with a less likable sinking ship,” it added.Harris, 59, experienced a surge in polling after replacing Biden as the Democratic candidate against former President Donald Trump. However, she has since fallen behind in critical swing-state polls. The RealClearPolitics average shows Harris trailing Trump, 78, in several key states. Trump has outperformed polls in the past two presidential elections.Initially, Biden argued that he had earned the nomination with over 14 million votes and minimal opposition in the state nominating contests. However, he ultimately decided to drop out and endorse Harris amidst growing pressure from Democrats who questioned his mental acuity following a June 27 debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) helped lead the mutiny, citing bleak polling that suggested Biden could harm down-ballot Democrats. Actor George Clooney, a friend of Obama's, also wrote a scathing New York Times op-ed detailing his concerns about Biden's cognitive fitness.","US President Joe Biden and Barack Obama were reportedly seen engaging in a private conversation over Vice President Kamala Harris' strength.

MAGA supporter questions Vivek Ramaswamy's Hindu faith: Check out his answer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-supporter-questions-vivek-ramaswamys-hindu-faith-check-out-his-answer/articleshow/114325526.cms,"Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy addressed questions about his faith during an event where a MAGA supporter accused him of drawing parallels between Hindu gods and Jesus Christ while avoiding publicly declaring his religion.The supporter expressed concerns that Ramaswamy's omission of specifying the God he referred to throughout his lecture could mislead the predominantly Christian audience into thinking he was talking about Jesus Christ.The supporter emphasized the incompatibility of Hinduism with America and challenged Ramaswamy to clarify which God he was referring to in his speeches.""I've got a couple of observations that I want to make, and then I was wondering if you would respond to them. So the first one is that throughout the course of the lecture, you talked an awful lot about God and faith . And there were some men that came up here and they asked you about your hindu religion. But my suspicion is if they didn't mention that, you would have omitted who that God was throughout the course of the entire lecture. And most of the people in this Room here would leave thinking you were talking about the only true God, Jesus Christ,"" a student asked Ramaswamy.""So my big question is, and you've talked about being forthright and transparent, my suspicion is that you would have omitted who that God was when you were speaking here tonight had you not explicitly been asked about Hinduism. So my challenge to you going forward would be to say who this God is?"" he added.In response, Ramaswamy said that he has been forthright about his identity, despite the ease of adopting a different name and pretending to be a Christian, as some other candidates have done. He dismissed the supporter's suspicion as baseless, citing his numerous campaign speeches over the past year.""You run for US President at the age of 37. As somebody who's been in business, who's actually easiest thing to call myself, some Vic Ramsey, and pretend to be a Christian, got other people on that debate stage last time who shortened their names and called themselves to be a Christian too, I man up and tell you who I am, and believe me, your suspicion is off base. Listen to any number of the campaign speeches. I gave over thousands of them over the course of the last year. So we can take the disingenuous accusation off the table, but level with what I do think is an interesting coming,"" Ramaswamy said.Further, Ramaswamy referenced Thomas Jefferson , who was not a traditional Christian but a deist, and asked the supporter if he considered Jefferson an enemy of Christianity.""So watch about the last presidential campaign of last year. And you apparently have had your head stuck in the sand where it need not belong. Now, what I think we need more of in our American politics is less of questioning the motivations of what somebody is and get to the content of where there's an actual difference of opinion. So the question of whether or not somebody of a non Christian faith can embody and lead the United States of America at any meaningful level is an open question. Thomas Jefferson is on the other side of this question from you. Thomas Jefferson was not a traditional Christian. Do you know what the Jefferson Bible is?"" he added.Earlier during his campaigning, Ramaswamy opened up about his 'Hindu' faith, emphasizing that it provides him with freedom and has motivated him to undertake this presidential campaign as a moral obligation.Ramaswamy said, ""My faith is what gives me my freedom. My faith is what led me to this presidential campaign. I am a Hindu. I believe there is one true God. I believe god put each of us here for a purpose. My faith teaches us that we have a duty, a moral duty to realise that purpose. Those are God's instruments that work through us in different ways, but we are still equal because God resides in each of us. That's the core of my faith"".","Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy addressed questions about his faith during an event where a MAGA supporter accused him of drawing parallels between Hindu gods and Jesus Christ while avoiding publicly declaring his religion.

US woman accused of killing and cooking mother's body parts arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-accused-of-killing-and-cooking-mothers-body-parts-arrested/articleshow/114325349.cms,"In a chilling case that has stunned the small town of Mount Olivet , Kentucky , a 32-year-old woman, Torilena May Fields , has been arrested for the brutal murder and dismemberment of her mother, Trudy Fields .Fields, an aspiring actress who went by the stage name Naomi Navarre during her time in California, is accused of not only killing her mother but also cooking parts of her body, including the severed head.She is facing multiple charges, including abuse of a corpse, evidence tampering, and obstruction.Police were called to Trudy Fields' home on October 9 after a worker discovered a disemboweled human torso in the backyard. The scene was so horrifying that authorities were forced to initiate an 11-hour standoff before Fields was apprehended. Investigators later found severed body parts — including a charred head, hands, and feet—inside a pot in the oven that was still warm, as reported by Fox56.According to the Robertson County grand jury indictment, Fields allegedly shot her mother in the head, stabbed her repeatedly, and dismembered the body. She is also accused of killing the family dog in what investigators describe as an unprovoked and intentional act. Evidence found at the scene, including blood-soaked mattresses and drag marks leading to the backyard, added to the horror.The worker who initially discovered the remains described a bizarre encounter with Fields. “She was casting spells on me,” he reportedly told 911 operators, alluding to Fields' erratic behavior.For many who knew her, Fields' actions are difficult to comprehend. Once a hopeful actress with roles in two films — The Desert Project and A Dance Story in 2019 — her life had taken a dark and disturbing turn. Fields had not posted on social media since September 2022, but family members suggest that a motorcycle accident in California may have contributed to her mental unraveling.Olivia Brock, Fields' cousin, was reportedly quoted as saying that the accident left her with a traumatic brain injury. “She was an actress and doing her thing out there,” Brock explained. “I guess we were told a couple of months ago that she was in a bad motorcycle accident and sustained a brain injury. I wonder if that’s what caused this.”Other family members share similar sentiments. Todd Brock, Fields' uncle, expressed disbelief at her actions. “I think somebody has lost control of their mind,” he said. “The girl in the mug shot? That’s not the girl we know.” He also mentioned hearing rumors that Fields had been involved in witchcraft or Satanism, adding a disturbing layer to the case.Fields was reportedly under the influence of drugs when she was arrested, though police have yet to specify the substances involved. She is currently being held on a $1.5 million bond at the Bourbon County Detention Center, awaiting trial for the gruesome murder.As the community grapples with the horrifying details, the Fields family is left to mourn both the tragic death of Trudy and the unraveling of a once-promising young woman.","Torilena May Fields, 32, has been arrested for the murder and dismemberment of her mother, Trudy Fields.

She also demanded that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party be treated in the same way as ""banned organisations"" in the country.Maryam, daughter of former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the rape incident was fabricated to create unrest in Punjab. She accused political opponents, particularly PTI, of using students and the media to propagate false information for political gains.On Wednesday, a large number of students held demonstrations in Jehlum, Faisalabad, and Gujrat, demanding justice for the alleged rape victim.However, the chief minister stated that no incident of rape took place at the Punjab College for Women in Lahore. She alleged that PTI and its media supporters spread the fake news to destabilise the province by manipulating innocent students.On Monday, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured during clashes with police over the alleged rape incident. Protesters claimed that the college administration had deleted CCTV footage to cover up the case.Maryam accused PTI of attempting to destabilise the government by spreading false narratives, particularly during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which portrayed Pakistan positively on the global stage. The two-day SCO summit concluded on Wednesday.She warned of strict action against those spreading fake news, including media personnel. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said, adding that the girl in question had suffered a back injury, not a rape, and was in the hospital ICU since October 2, contradicting the circulated claims.Addressing PTI founder Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for the last 15 months, she remarked, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are.""The chief minister also accused certain individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and abroad of fuelling the controversy through fake news.""The issue isn't social media, but rather PTI, which needs to be controlled...and everything will be fine. They are operating through fake accounts,"" she alleged.Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has launched a probe against those involved in spreading disinformation through social media platforms about the alleged on-campus rape incident.A seven-member team headed by Deputy Director Cybercrime Lahore Waqas Saeed will identify individuals responsible for the disinformation campaign and the subsequent law-and-order situation.","Punjab's first woman Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz dismisses rape claims as fabricated.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims. Hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses.

Islamabad 'lockdown' greets Chinese PM amid aftershocks of Karachi suicide attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/islamabad-lockdown-greets-chinese-pm-amid-aftershocks-of-karachi-suicide-attack/articleshow/114231377.cms,"ISLAMABAD: PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days as Pakistan pulled out all stops to avoid any safety slip-up during the first visit by a Chinese premier to the country in 11 years.Li's four-day trip to oversee the signing of bilateral trade and economic agreements, inaugurate an international airport in the southwestern port city of Gwadar, and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit comes just over a week after a suicide attack near Karachi airport in which two Chinese engineers died and 11 others were wounded.As PM Shehbaz Sharif and members of his cabinet received Li at the Chaklala airbase in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, adjacent to Islamabad, news arrived of at least three cops and as many militants being killed during an attack on the district police headquarters in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.A wave of violence has swept Pakistan lately, including 21 miners being shot and killed in Balochistan, where the new Gwadar airport is located. Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad.
