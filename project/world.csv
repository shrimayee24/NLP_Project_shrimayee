Charlie Kirk 'ASSASSIN' On Cam: FBI Releases Photos Of Shooting Suspect | BREAKING NEWS





Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot Thursday while speaking at Utah Valley University.As law enforcement continues its manhunt for the suspect, an odd development has added to the confusion: Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “The Shooting of Charlie Kirk: A Comprehensive Account of the Utah Valley University Attack, the Aftermath, and America’s Response,” credited to an author named Anastasia J Casey.According to the screenshots, the listed publication date was September 9—one day before the shooting. The listing was allegedly visible on Amazon briefly before being removed. The images of the cover, title, and date quickly spread across X, fueling speculation about foreknowledge or a cover-up.“Can someone investigate this perhaps? It’s now pulled from Amazon online listing. Who is Anastasia Casey? Regardless of the credibility of the 9.9 publish date, how did this book get out so quick,” one user wrote.Another post read: “But check this out, another book published today? How the hell can you get a book published and up for sale in such short time ??? @FBIDirectorKash @AGPamBondi @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr.”Some users drew comparisons to past events. “A book entitled ‘The Shooting of Charlie Kirk’ by Anastasia J Casey has appeared on Amazon with a PUBLICATION DATE OF SEPTEMBER 9TH 2025. A DAY BEFORE HE WAS ASSASSINATED,” one person commented.Others pointed out more examples. “This is like the 9/11 reporting strangeness. Something is off on how quickly these people are making these books. There are 2-3 more published yesterday about Charlie's assassination. One is 36 pages,” another user noted.Amazon in a statement said that they have taken down the title in question. “We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we remove books that do not adhere to these guidelines. The title in question is no longer available for sale. Due to a technical issue, the date of publication that had been displayed for this title, while it was briefly listed, was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

Major political parties denounced his decision, calling it “unconstitutional” and a “blow to democracy,"" PTI reported.Karki, 73, was sworn in on Friday night as Nepal’s first woman prime minister, ending days of political uncertainty after the abrupt resignation of KP Sharma Oli this week amid widespread anti-government protests over a social media ban and alleged corruption.Oli stepped down on Tuesday shortly after hundreds of demonstrators entered his office demanding his resignation. More than 50 people were killed in the nationwide protests.Almost all leading political parties, including the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), condemned the dissolution, as per PTI.“This move to dissolve parliament is against the spirit of our Constitution and the interpretation of the Supreme Court.It is absolutely unconstitutional,” the Nepali Congress said in a statement.According to a notification from the President’s Office, parliament stood dissolved with effect from 11 pm on September 12.Even as political tensions remained high in Kathmandu, normalcy began returning with curfew and restrictive orders lifted.Karki is expected to form a small Cabinet on Sunday and will hold about two dozen ministries—including home, foreign affairs and defence—according to sources. With the Prime Minister’s Office in Singhdurbar Secretariat damaged in the unrest, the newly built Home Ministry premises within the complex are being prepared for her office.The agitation, which began Monday against a government social-media ban, quickly expanded into a broader movement reflecting public anger over corruption and political apathy.","President's decision to dissolve parliament received backlash from several parties.

Ex-Tibetan PM in exile says Chinese embassies meddling in Nepal; warns India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-tibetan-pm-in-exile-says-chinese-embassies-meddling-in-nepal-warns-india/articleshow/123870939.cms,"China, India To Ink New Border Deal At SCO Summit? Envoy Drops Bombshell | Watch

NEW DELHI: Chinese Embassy officials of interfering directly in the local affairs of South Asian countries, particularly in Nepal, former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay claimed, and also warned India to be vigilant about its dealings with Beijing.In an conversation at ANI podcast, Sangay voiced concern over China’s “expansionist” policies and its efforts to “checkmate” India’s influence in the region.Asked whether India, like some Southeast Asian nations, avoids the Tibet issue to preserve ties with Beijing, Sangay replied that he did not believe India followed that approach, but stressed that “China is systematically working” to curb New Delhi’s reach.""India has a bigger stake with China,"" Sangay said. ""Just look at not just Tibet, not just the border area. Look at all the neighbouring countries. In Southeast Asia or Central Asia, wherever India wants to have its influence or relationship, China is always there to checkmate.""Using Nepal as an example, he alleged that Chinese officials had become “the most powerful” players in Kathmandu, “perhaps more powerful than the Indian or American embassies.”He said similar patterns of interference were visible in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “They come and interfere and influence. I don’t want to say they control you, but they come inside your own house,” he said.""And the larger point that you raised about, you know, in Asia, how many people will take up the issue of Tibet because they don't want to have conflict with China, which is a fact on the one hand. On the other hand, what we say is that what happened to Tibet will happen to you. So if you don't understand and study Tibet, it will happen to you,"" he added.He pointed to Nepal as a clear example of Chinese political overreach. ""Let's say Nepal -- they didn't believe so, right? Now, yes, the Chinese embassy and the officials are interfering in local issues,"" he said. ""The Chinese Embassy, perhaps, some of my friends say, is the most powerful in Kathmandu -- more powerful than the Indian Embassy or American Embassy. Some say that.""He highlighted China's full physical control over Tibet and its current approach in other countries. ""The difference is the physical control of Tibet,"" Sangay said. ""Other than that, political influence of the Chinese government -- and through the embassies -- in all these neighbouring countries and all these Asian countries is a fact.""He also framed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Tibet as strategic signals aimed at India, noting the region’s shared border and China’s large military deployment there. While transcripts of Xi’s latest speech to troops were not released—coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Beijing—Sangay said he was “sure” it echoed previous calls to “prepare for war or incursion” against India.Reflecting on his own experience, Sangay described how Tibetans had found a temporary home in India after fleeing their homeland. “As a Buddhist, we believe in impermanence. Once you lose your country, you’re nomadic,” he said, adding that India became “our home” after Tibetans fled. Although he now lives in the United States, he said he feels an enduring cultural bond with India: “As soon as I come out of Indira Gandhi Airport, when you smell the Delhi air… for your mind, it’s just calming. ”He stressed that ties between Tibetans and Indians remain strong. “Whenever I meet Indians, I immediately say Namaskar… immediately, you become friends.”Sangay also recalled how, during his tenure from 2011 to 2021, Chinese pressure often accompanied periods of India–China rapprochement. He cited the 2018 “Thank You India” event planned by the Tibetan administration, which was scaled back after India reportedly advised officials to avoid participation in the midst of efforts to ease tensions with Beijing.Despite such episodes, Sangay emphasised India’s consistent support. ""No matter which party or which person becomes Prime Minister, India has always treated Tibetans well. We cannot think of any better host for Tibetans,"" he said, adding that the preservation of Tibetan identity, education, and religious institutions has been possible due to India's support.","Former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay spoke to ANI podcast.

Noida hostel firing incident: Gunshot kills 22-year-old student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noida-hostel-firing-incident-gunshot-leaves-22-year-old-student-dead/articleshow/123794605.cms,"NOIDA: A 22-year-old student was found dead with a gunshot wound in the head while his close friend lay critically injured with a similar wound inside a private hostel room in Knowledge Park in Noida on Tuesday morning. Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells. They also seized the students' mobile phones, laptops, and other personal belongings from the room.While the exact sequence of events is unclear, police are examining the possibility of a confrontation between the two students.Bimtech did not respond to requests for a comment.",Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech) It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired.

T'puram: In a first in India, Kerala cabinet Saturday cleared a draft bill to amend Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, authorising the chief wildlife warden to order the killing of any wild animal that attacks and injures a person in a residential area.The move comes amid a series of reports of man-animal conflicts in recent months. ""The central govt and National Tiger Conservation Authority issued an SOP on Jan 30, 2013, detailing how to handle tigers that enter human habitats. Guidelines for handling elephants are also in place. These impractical provisions in the central law and the SOP act as obstacles to killing dangerous wild animals even in emergency situations. This is why the state govt has introduced the amendment bill,"" forest minister A K Saseendran said.The bill also allows the regulation of animal populations listed in Schedule II of the Act and their relocation to other areas, without requiring central govt approval.","Kerala cabinet Saturday cleared a draft bill to amend Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah has expressed concern over the vanishing hangul, a critically endangered subspecies of Central Asian red deer, also known as the Kashmir stag, which is endemic to the Kashmir region. He fears they may go extinct.“I don’t want a situation tomorrow where our children and grandchildren know these species only through photographs in books, like the dodo or woolly mammoth,” the CM said at the 2nd International Conference on Hangul at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture and Science here on Friday. “That would be a tragedy we must not allow,” he said.Omar said that despite living close to Dachigam National Park, he had never seen a hangul. “But at least in my lifetime I know they are there,” he said. The hangul is now largely confined to Dachigam National Park in Srinagar’s Harwan area. Their population had shrunk to just 127 in 2008. However, the hangul census of 2023 showed their population rising to 289. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the species as critically endangered.The CM said his government would act promptly on the recommendations of the Second International Conference on Hangul protection.“My hope is that when we meet here next time, the population of hangul and markhor (a wild goat species) will have grown significantly,” Omar said.The three-day event at the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture and Science was attended by more than 200 delegates, including eminent wildlife experts, conservationists, and biologists from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia, who shared research and strategies for conserving the hangul, markhor and other threatened ungulates of the Himalayan region.","The hangul is a subspecies of Central Asian red deer, also known as the Kashmir stag.

Is Kash Patel Hindu ?







FBI director Kash Patel was called cringe and a dork for his message for Charlie Kirk at the FBI press conference Friday where the agency revealed the name of Kirk's shooter and the details of how the FBI nabbed him after a failed attempt. ""To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother. We have the watch and I'll see you in Valhalla,"" Kash Patel said.Valhalla belongs to the Old Norse religion (also called Norse paganism), which was practiced by the Vikings and other Germanic peoples of Scandinavia before Christianity spread there. It refers to the 'Hall of the Slain', an enormous hall located in Asgard ruled by the god Odin. In Norse mythology, it is believed that warriors who die bravely in battle are chosen by Odin and enter Valhalla.Kash Patel came under fire in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's death, as the FBI got the wrong person initially, whom they let out after they realized he was not the shooter. Patel was called incompetent for the major confusion and now the social media is up in arms over his 'valhalla' comment.""Indian guy saying that he’ll see a Christian in Valhalla is some confused theology,"" one wrote. Many jumped into Patel's defense saying that it's a common saying in military apart from the Valhalla part.""We don’t believe in valhalla you dork. this is so not the time or place to be cute,"" one wrote.Another pointed out that FBI actually did nothing to nab Tyler Robinson, the suspected shooter who killed Charlie Kirk.

Trump ‘Directs’ G7 Nations To ‘Put High Tariffs’ On India & China For Buying Russian Oil | Report

Tariffs on China, sanctions on Russia



Tensions in Nato and Europe







US President Donald Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese goods while calling on Nato allies to halt oil purchases from Russia, arguing that such measures would end the war in Ukraine swiftly.In an aggressive post on Truth Social, which he described as “a letter to all Nato nations and the world,” Trump claimed that only decisive economic action could stop what he called a “deadly, but ridiculous, war.” He insisted that Nato had failed to fully commit to defeating Moscow and accused some members of weakening the alliance by continuing to buy Russian oil.“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all Nato Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all Nato Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” Trump wrote. “Anyway, I am ready to ‘go’ when you are. Just say when?”Trump went further, urging the alliance to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing, ranging from 50 to 100 per cent, arguing that China’s support was vital to Russia’s war effort. “China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip,” he wrote, suggesting the tariffs would be lifted once the conflict ended.The president blamed his predecessor Joe Biden and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for prolonging the war, while absolving Russian President Vladimir Putin. “This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR,” he said.Trump claimed that “7,118 lives” had been lost in the past week alone, describing the bloodshed as “crazy” and insisting his approach could end the conflict rapidly. “If Nato does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States,” he added.Trump’s remarks come amid heightened tensions after Russian drones entered Polish airspace last week, prompting Nato fighters to intercept them. Poland and other European leaders dismissed Trump’s suggestion that the incursion might have been a “mistake,” calling it a deliberate provocation.Nato has since launched “Eastern Sentry,” a new defensive operation bolstering its eastern flank with aircraft and ground systems from France, Denmark, Germany and the UK. Meanwhile, Britain and France announced fresh sanctions and military support to Ukraine, while Canada, chairing the G7 this year, convened finance ministers to discuss cutting off Russia’s revenues.The Trump administration has already imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, including a 25 per cent levy linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian crude. The move has strained US-India trade ties, with talks on a new agreement delayed.Speaking to G7 countries, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer echoed Trump’s message, urging allies to form a “unified front” against Moscow’s oil revenues. “Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,” they said.Despite international measures, Russian attacks on Ukraine have escalated, with Moscow unleashing massive drone strikes while Kyiv hit back at Russia’s largest oil port in the Baltic.","US President Donald Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese goods.

Anti-migrant focus



Flags and slogans







London’s streets turned into a stage for Britain’s anxieties on Saturday, as far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. Tens of thousands of people marched, leading to sporadic clashes with police.The marchers came to London by train and coach for what was called a ""festival of free speech,"" but speeches during the event spread racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim comments across Whitehall, The Guardian reported.Police said some officers were punched, kicked, and hit by bottles thrown from the edges of the ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. More than 1,000 officers were deployed, with reinforcements in helmets and riot shields sent in when needed, as per a report by news agency Associated Press.According to police, the crowd count was estimated at 1,10,000 to 1,50,000 people, much larger than expected. However, it was still smaller than the pro-Palestinian march in November 2023 that drew a crowd count of about 300,000 people.A rival protest, the ""March Against Fascism"" organized by Stand Up To Racism, attracted a crowd count of around 5,000 participants.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the English Defense League and is one of the most prominent far-right figures in Britain.The march was presented as a defense of free speech. However, much of the messaging from speakers, including far-right politicians from Europe, centered on migration.""We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture, you and we are being colonized by our former colonies,"" French politician Eric Zemmour said.Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and owner of X, joined by video and criticized the UK government. ""There’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion, but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration,"" he said.Robinson told the crowd that migrants had more rights in court than the ""British public, the people that built this nation.""The rallies come amid political debate in the UK over migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats without authorization. This summer saw several anti-migrant protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers, following the conviction of an Ethiopian man for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in London. Some of these protests turned violent and led to arrests.At the ""Unite the Kingdom"" march, participants carried St George’s flags and the union jack and chanted ""we want our country back.""Flags have become more common across the UK in recent months, with some viewing them as national pride and others as a sign of growing nationalism.Protesters held placards saying ""stop the boats,"" ""send them home,"" and ""enough is enough, save our children.""Counter-protesters carried signs that read ""refugees welcome"" and ""smash the far right,"" while chanting ""stand up, fight back.""Robinson’s supporters also shouted crude remarks about UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and expressed support for slain US conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally.

Your friendship was amazing.”She thanked vice president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance for standing by her family. “You honoured my husband so well, bringing him home.

""One of the last conversations he had on this earth was witnessing for his lord and saviour, Jesus Christ,” she said.She also called out those responsible for his killing. “The evildoers who assassinated my husband have no idea what they have done.

The assassination of 31-year-old Charlie Kirk, known to be openly transphobic, took a new turn Saturday as it was revealed that the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, has a trans partner . The Daily Mail revealed the name of the trans partner -- transforming from a man to a woman -- as Lance Twiggs. According to the report, Twiggs lived with Tyler Robinson in a three-bedroom apartment in Saint George, Utah.Twiggs is the person who received text messages from Tyler after the shooting about stashing a gun. Twiggs' grandfather Jerry Twiggs told Daily Mail that he was unable to comment on rumours that Twiggs is trans and there was a transgender motive to Kirk's murder. He also said he never met Robinson but he confirmed that his grandchild had been talking with the police.Authorities are yet to confirm a motive, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox told the Wall Street Journal that Robinson was, 'deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology'.South Utah native, Twiggs, studied at Utah Tech University, according to his Facebook page. Robinson, 22, was also taking electrician training at a nearby technical college. Like Tyler, Twiggs is also an avid gamer. He posted himself on social media playing popular games including Apex Legends, Valorant and Rocket League.Other comical videos he shared included adding spaghetti to an Italian sandwich and microwaving a bottle of Mountain Dew. Friends told the Daily Mail that Robinson and Twiggs were part of a large group chat of dozens of gamer friends mostly from Robinson’s alma mater, Pine View High School, hosted on online chat network Discord.Twiggs, however, has not been named in the affidavit that the police filed supporting the murder, obstruction and felony firearm charges against Robinson. ""The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique,"" the affidavit said.

The FBI confirmed the two were in a romantic relationship.One FBI official said the partner has been “extremely cooperative,” stressing that the person “had no idea” Robinson was planning to target Kirk.

Agents also seized computers and other evidence from the couple’s apartment, which has been sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico for analysis.While the Bureau declined to say whether Robinson’s partner could face charges, a spokesperson emphasised the scale of the probe.“The FBI is investigating a record number of tips. Every connection, every group, every link will be investigated, and anyone involved in this matter, anywhere in the world they might be, will be brought to justice,"" the spokesperson told Fox News.The apartment is located in the same southern Utah community where Robinson’s parents live, about four hours from Utah Valley University in Orem.

US President Donald Trump came to the defence of FBI director Kash Patel on Saturday, praising his handling of the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Trump's statement came amid Patel facing mounting criticism from within the bureau and from political allies.“I am very proud of the FBI,” Trump said in a brief interview with Fox News. “Kash — and everyone else — they have done a great job.”Republican governor Spencer Cox announced Friday that law enforcement had apprehended 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who has been ordered held without bail. Prosecutors are expected to file formal charges against him next week. Robinson is accused of fatally shooting Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, during a speech at Utah Valley University.Patel’s leadership has come under fire following a confusing sequence of updates he shared on social media earlier this week. On Wednesday, Patel initially announced that a “subject” was in law enforcement custody, only to later clarify, two hours afterwards, that the person had been released after questioning.The episode, coupled with lingering criticism over Patel’s handling of files connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has fueled doubts about his leadership among both former FBI officials and some Republicans who once championed his appointment.Despite the backlash, the White House strongly backed Patel’s work. “Director Patel and his team worked night and day to find this murderer and bring him to justice,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement to POLITICO.“Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication — especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him — simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship. The focus was on catching this killer, and he will face the full wrath of the justice system,” Cheung added.Patel is scheduled to appear before Congress this week, where lawmakers are expected to press him on the investigation and the bureau’s handling of updates to the public.",US President Donald Trump came to the defence of FBI director Kash Patel on Saturday.

NAGPUR: A 24 years-old school van driver died after his vehicle collided head-on with a bus on the Mankapur flyover on Friday morning, leaving several students injured. Police identified the driver as Hrithik Kanojia, who succumbed to injuries at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMC) after being brought in with serious injuries. One girl student is admitted to the intensive care unit of a private hospital, while at least three other children are under treatment in the same facility. Some other students were taken to different hospitals, as the accident site was in close proximity to a few hospitals.The accident occurred around 8.30am when Kanojia’s van, carrying students of Bhavan’s Bhagwandas Purohit Vidya Mandir, Koradi Road Branch, hit a Narayana Vidyalam bus coming from the opposite direction.The impact left the van mangled, trapping students inside. Passersby broke open jammed doors and carried the injured to nearby hospitals. Only two children were conscious when rescued, while others were found unconscious.The bus driver and two female attendants were unharmed. The bus was on its way to pick up students from the city and had no students at the time. The driver told police that the van had entered his lane, leaving no time to avoid the collision.Traffic on the flyover was halted for nearly an hour after the crash.For the last several months, vehicles have been forced to ply both ways on a single side of the flyover as repairs continue on the damaged stretch between Mankapur Stadium and Faras. Commuters have repeatedly flagged the risk posed by the narrowed lanes and slow pace of work.Parents of the injured children rushed to the hospitals soon after learning of the incident. Doctors treating the students said most had multiple injuries and are undergoing treatment.The accident has renewed concerns over traffic management and prolonged construction on one of the city’s busiest flyovers. Police have registered a case and further investigation is underway.","Hrithik Kanojia, 24, died after his van collided head-on with a bus on the Mankapur flyover on Friday morning.

Nepal: Rights body urges escapees to surrender,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-rights-body-urges-escapees-to-surrender/articleshow/123878089.cms,"



KATHMANDU: With the situation in the country gradually returning to normal, Nepal’s security agencies and authorities are now desperate to see its 12,000-odd inmates who escaped from different jails during the protest back in their barracks.While security agencies were able to nab around 1,500 inmates -- out of the total 13,500 who had fled -- the majority are still missing. What has added to the anxiety of the administration is that the escapees include some notorious criminals, like dreaded gold smuggler Chudamani Upreti, who was lodged in Sundhara Central jail from where around 3,200 inmates escaped on Sept 9.Staring at an unprecedented internal security problem, officials have appealed to the general population for help in the form of tip-offs. Many have responded, informing police about the whereabouts of an escapee, sometimes nabbing the criminals themselves before handing them over.On Saturday, the country’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) joined in, asking the jailbirds to return and surrender the weapons looted on Sept 9.Expressing concern, it said that the jailbreaks had caused a sense of fear and insecurity among citizens, many of whom have in turn run away from their homes fearing reprisals.“The jailbreaks have caused distress among women, children and victims of crime. We urge security agencies to intensify efforts in searching for the fugitives and bring them back to their respective cells,” the rights body said.Amid the appeals by authorities, Rabi Lamichhane, president of Nepal’s Rashtriya Swatantra Party, returned to the Nakhu prison on Saturday. He was arrested in October last year for his alleged involvement in the Supreme Cooperative fraud case and was lodged in Nakhu prison in Lalitpur, from where he had escaped on Sept 9, citing ""security concerns during the violence"".Releasing a public notice, authorities said: ""It is urged that the escapees abide by legal procedures and social responsibility by returning voluntarily. Failure to do so would result in their continued status as fugitives along with enforcement of harsher penalties under Prison Act 2022 and other prevailing laws.""","Nepal's security agencies and authorities desperate to see its 12,000-odd inmates who escaped back in their barracks.

KYIV: Romania became the latest Nato member state to report a drone incursion into its airspace Saturday, as Poland scrambled aircraft in response to fresh Russian drone strikes just over the border in Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia was deliberately expanding its drone operations and that the West needed to respond with tougher sanctions and closer defence cooperation.In Washington, US President Donald Trump said he was ready to impose major sanctions on Russia -- just as soon as all Nato nations did the same thing and stopped buying Russian oil.Romania's defence ministry said Saturday that the country's airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine.The country scrambled two F-16 fighter jets late on Saturday to monitor the situation following the strikes, said a defence ministry statement.The jets ""detected a drone in national airspace"" and tracked it until ""it disappeared from the radar"" near the Romanian village of Chilia Veche, it added.Also Saturday, Poland said it and its Nato allies had deployed helicopters and aircraft as Russian drones struck Ukraine not far from its border.Because of the drone threat, ""Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, and ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have reached their highest level of alert,"" the country's military command posted in a statement on X.Later Saturday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the high alert had been lifted, while cautioning: ""We remain vigilant.""Poland and its fellow Nato countries have been on their guard since Warsaw said nearly 20 Russian drones entered its airspace overnight Tuesday to Wednesday.While Russia denies targeting Poland, several European countries including France, Germany and Sweden have stepped up their support for defending Polish airspace in response.""Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace,"" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.""Also today, Poland responded militarily to the threat of Russian attack drones,"" which had also been active in different regions of Ukraine all day, he added.The Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air,"" said Zelenskyy.The latest drone incursions were ""an obvious expansion of the war by Russia"", he added.What was required in response were fresh sanctions against Russia and a collective defence system, Zelenskyy argued.""Do not wait for dozens of 'shaheds' and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,"" he warned, referring to the Iranian-designed Shahed drones Russia is using.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday expressed concern at the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace earlier in the week.If it turned out to have been deliberate, ""then obviously it will be... highly escalatory,"" he told reporters in Washington.Trump's suggestion on Thursday that the incident might have happened by ""mistake"", was quickly dismissed by Tusk.On Saturday, Trump returned to the issue of sanctions against Russia, putting the ball back in the court of his Nato allies.""I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all Nato Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all Nato Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,"" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.Trump has repeatedly threatened sanctions against Russia without following through.In Russia, an official reported that a Ukrainian drone had hit one of its largest oil refining complexes, 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.The drone had sparked a fire and caused minor damage at the complex, which belongs to Russian oil company Bashneft, and lies on the outskirts of the central Russian city of Ufa.A source in Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency claimed responsibility for the attack.Since Moscow launched its full-scale military offensive in Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has responded with attacks on Russian refineries in an attempt to curb the Kremlin's ability to fund the conflict through its fossil fuel industry.",Romania's defence ministry said Saturday that the country's airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine.

"Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson lived with a transgender partner, claims report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-lived-with-a-transgender-partner-claims-report/articleshow/123872792.cms,"Tyler Robinson is not a trans person but reports claim that he was living with a trans partner.

'This is now officially trans violence'



Are there too many transgender shooters in America? What was Charlie Kirk's view on transgender people?







The roommate who revealed texts with Tyler Robinson that helped law enforcement conclude that Tyler was indeed the shooter of Charlie Kirk is a transgender person, reports claimed, making a major revelation. The authorities have not revealed the transgender person's identity, but the person is part of the investigation. The partner is in the process of transitioning from a male to female, Fox News reported.It is interesting that Tyler fired his shot targeting Charlie Kirk when Kirk was asked a question about transgender mass shooters. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” Charlie Kirk was asked. ""Too many,"" Kirk said. “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked in a follow-up question. “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked seeking clarification on the question, when the bullet hit his neck and he collapsed. He was taken to a hospital where he underwent surgery. He did not survive the injury.The revelation that Tyler has a trans partner gave a new turn to the assassination as MAGA commentators claimed this to be trans violence.MAGA commentators said more is to come out soon about the assassination and Charlie Kirk was absolutely right that there were too many trans shooters in America now.The revelations gives a probable motive to the investigators, though as of now they are seeing it as a political killing, as Tyler told pals and family members that he did not like Charlie Kirk much as he was hateful. Tyler did not like that Charlir Kirk was coming to the Utah Wave University for this event. Utah Guv Spencer Cox claimed that Tyler was deeply indoctrinated with left ideologies -- though the Robinson family is Trump supporters.According to fact-checking website PolitiFact, Charlie Kirk was wrong when he said there were too many trans shooters in the US and data showed trans people conduct a very small percentage of mass shootings.Charlie Kirk had a very strong feeling against transgender people and called them ""an abomination"". In one speech, he described trans people as a “throbbing middle finger to God.” He also opposed gender-transforming surgeries and said doctors who perform those are like Nazis committing atrocities. ""One issue I think that is so against our senses, so against the natural law and dare I say a throbbing middle finger to God, is the transgender thing happening in America right now,” he said during a speech posted in 2023 by Right Wing Watch.","Tyler Robinson is not a trans person but reports claim that he was living with a trans partner.

Putin’s provocation meets Trump’s hesitation



Nato caught in the middle



What comes next







When Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace this week, Nato scrambled jets, Warsaw sounded alarm, and Europe braced for escalation. But it was the response from Washington, more specifically, from President Donald Trump that quickly became the centre of global attention.“What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, before telling reporters that the incursion “could have been a mistake.”The ambiguous phrasing unsettled allies who view Poland’s security as central to Nato’s credibility. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk curtly responded: “We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn’t. And we know it.”A day later, Trump urged Nato countries to stop buying Russian oil as a means of pressuring Putin into ending the war in Ukraine. Trump's post also signaled his frustration with Nato, with the POTUS claiming that the alliance's commitment to ending the war ""has been far less than 100%"" and called the continued purchase of Russian oil by some members “shocking.” Addressing Nato countries, he said: “It greatly weakens your negotiating position and bargaining power over Russia.The incursion involved more than a dozen drones, making it unlikely to be accidental. Military analysts see it as deliberate probing by Vladimir Putin, a hallmark of his “salami slicing” strategy, pushing boundaries in small, incremental steps to test adversaries’ resolve.Nicholas Kristof, writing in the New York Times, described it as “an enormous escalation by President Vladimir Putin” and a direct test of Nato. One stray drone could be dismissed, he noted, but multiple incursions were intentional: “That’s how Putin operates: He tests and measures the reaction.”The episode also highlighted Putin’s belief that Trump’s refusal so far to impose the harsh sanctions he has threatened makes now the right time to push. In January, Trump warned of “high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” against Moscow; in May he promised measures that would be “crushing for Russia.” Deadlines came and went, but no action followed. As Kristof put it: “After this parade of bluster, of course, Putin doesn’t take Trump’s warnings seriously. ”For Nato leaders, the incursion is less about drones and more about deterrence. Secretary general Mark Rutte said a full assessment was ongoing but praised the swift allied response.Benjamin Godwin of PRISM Strategic Intelligence told CNBC: “Russia is able to sort of escalate in these very, as we say in the UK, salami-slicing ways and Nato has proven incapable so far in responding in any effective way.”Nato allies have since reinforced defences on the eastern flank and discussed new sanctions. But as Oksana Nechyporenko of the Atlantic Council warned, “the softer the West’s reaction to Russia’s violation of Polish airspace, the harder the next blow will be.”That puts Trump’s words and the gap between his threats and actions under sharper scrutiny. If Washington downplays deliberate violations of Nato airspace, analysts warn, it risks weakening deterrence and emboldening Moscow to push further.The drone incursion has forced Nato back into crisis mode, but it has also pulled Trump squarely into the spotlight. His reaction will be read not only in Warsaw and Brussels, but in Moscow and Beijing.Trump once criticised Barack Obama for making “blank threats,” insisting: “The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them.” Now, allies and adversaries alike are watching closely to see whether that still holds true.","Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace this week.

FBI Seizes Dodge Challenger, Raids Homes Of Suspected Charlie Kirk Killer

Why Tyler left Utah State University?







Utah Governor Spencer Cox who has emerged in a crucial national role after the assassination of Charlie Kirk as he was the one who detailed the arrest of Tyler Robinson, claimed that the suspected killer's political leaning is very clear to the investigators. Tyler has been deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology, Cox said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.Tyler is neither registered as a Democrat or a Republican voter and while the Conservatives believe Tyler is left-leaning, social media is convinced that Tyler is extreme-right, a follower of Nick Fuentes' Groypers. But then why did he say he did not like Conservative activist Charlie Kirk? Because the Groypers considered Charlie Kirk to be too moderate.Amid this tussle between the left and the right, Cox confirmed that it is left.At a recent family dinner, Robinson ranted over Kirk's first stop of his American Comeback tour at the Orem campus, which was about a three-hour drive from his home.Cox said Tyler openly said that he didn't like Kirk or Kirk's viewpoints, as he found Kirk full of hate. “They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had,” the Republican governor said.Though a good student, investigators have observed a sudden shift in his academic career as he left Utah State University after just a semester, even after getting a four-year merit scholarship. The university confirmed that he attended only one semester in 2021 as a pre-engineering major.Robinson then enrolled at Dixie Technical College in St. George, a spokesperson for the college said in a statement. He is currently a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program, and according to state records, obtained an apprentice electrician license in 2022.Those who knew Tyler from before though he was a Republican, as his family was Trump supporters but people with whom his interaction was recent are of the opinion that he did not like Trump or Charlie Kirk.","Utah governor claims Tyler Robinson was deeply indoctrinated with left ideologies.
