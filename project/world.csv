Hostage Drama At Powai Studio: Mumbai Police Rescues 17 Kidnapped Children, Accused Killed

'Rs 2 crore dues'





NEW DELHI: Panic gripped Mumbai's Powai area on Thursday after a man identified as Rohit Arya allegedly took 19 people hostage, including 17 children, a senior citizen and one unidentified man, inside RA Studio.Arya later died after being injured in the chest during a police crossfire. The senior citizen was also hurt in the exchange and was rushed to Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Hospital for treatment, as per reports.Mumbai Police teams, including senior officers and a quick response unit, rushed to the spot after receiving information about the standoff. ""All children have been safely rescued from the spot,"" police said in a statement.Read also: Who was captor Rohit Aarrya? Man behind Mumbai hostage scare sat on hunger strike over Rs 2 crore govt dues; new details emerge According to police, Arya had released a video in which he demanded to speak to certain individuals and warned that he would harm himself and the children and “set everything on fire” if prevented.The standoff ended after a police inspector forced entry into the studio and seized an airgun and some chemical from Arya’s possession, Powai police said.Joint Commissioner of Police (L&O) Satyanarayan Chaudhary said, “Prima facie, the motive behind the hostage act appears to be related to some pending work-related dues.”Police said the incident was reported around 1.45 pm, when a distress call from the studio prompted teams from Powai and Sakinaka police stations to rush to the spot.The children, aged between 13 and 17 years, had reportedly travelled from different parts of Maharashtra to attend an audition for an ad shoot being held at the studio.Officials had described the accused as mentally unstable and said they acted swiftly to defuse the situation.

It acquitted the accused who had been sentenced to 10-year jail under POSCO Act, saying the crime was not the result of lust but love.The court highlighted that the couple are now happily married and have a child together.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih said while the man was guilty under the law, the rigidity of law should not be allowed to cause injustice. ""We are persuaded to hold that this is a case where the law must yield to the cause of justice,"" the judges ruled.The wife told the court that she wanted to lead a happy, normal, and peaceful life with him and their child born in their wedlock.""As per the law..., the appellant having been found guilty of a heinous offence, the proceedings in the present case on the basis of a compromise between the appellant and his wife cannot be quashed.

""While considering the offence... punishable under the POCSO Act, we have discerned that the crime was not the result of lust but love.

It invoked Article 142 in another case in May to let off a convict under POCSO Act and expressed wonder over how a girl from a village in West Bengal had fought a legal battle singlehandedly, after being abandoned by her family and ostracised by society, to get her lover released from jail. The court said it doesn't want to heap on to the injustice already suffered by the victim at the hands of the society, her family and legal system.","The couple are now happily married and have a child together.

Congress Chief Kharge Demands Ban On RSS Citing Sardar Patel's 1948 Letter, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: As Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge called for a ban on RSS citing the decision of the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, BJP hit back recalling comments of both Patel and Mahatma Gandhi praising RSS and accusing Kharge of using the language of fundamentalist Muslim organisations like PFI.Kharge said RSS should be proscribed because it is endangering national unity, underlining Patel banning the right-wing organisation in 1948 after its functionaries ""celebrated and distributed sweets"" in the wake of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. He accused PM Narendra Modi of disrespecting the ""iron man"" by removing in 2024 the ban on govt employees from joining RSS, and by removing chapters on Gandhi, Godse, RSS and 2002 Gujarat riots from three NCERT books.He said, ""My personal view is that RSS should be banned. If Modi & Amit Shah eulogise the ills that Patel put out in public (before banning RSS), then it should be banned. The problems of law & order are because of RSS & BJP.""BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Patel had described RSS as an organisation of patriots days before Gandhi's assassination in Jan 1948 & echoed a similar view in a letter to its then chief M S Golwalkar in Nov 1948.""Kharge said Patel wrote to Golwalkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee about the decision to ban RSS. ""RSS speeches are full of communal poison... which led to Gandhi's killing. RSS people rejoiced and distributed sweets... We have no other option but to ban RSS,"" he said, adding, ""These are Patel's words. But those who killed Gandhi and think ill of Gandhi, they are telling us that Congress does not remember Patel. The two Gujarat netas (Modi and Shah) say this. They must tell what they did for the country.""Another BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Kapur Commission, which had probed the conspiracy behind Gandhi's killing, had absolved RSS and that the Supreme Court's verdict on similar lines is also in public domain. He said several Congress leaders, including Indira Gandhi, have spoken positively of RSS and noted that Pranab Mukherjee was also full of praise for it after he as the then President of India visited its headquarters.","Mallikarjun Kharge calls for a ban on RSS citing the decision of the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday called for a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), linking it to what he described as widespread law and order problems in the country. “It is my personal opinion, it should be done,” Kharge said when asked whether the RSS should be banned, adding that “most of the issues and law and order problems are arising because of the BJP-RSS. ”Referring to the Congress’ role in India’s freedom struggle, Kharge said, “People today comment on a party whose members sacrificed their lives for the country. But if we say something about the RSS, we are directly attacked.” Citing Sardar Patel’s letter to Syama Prasad Mookerjee dated 4 February 1948, he added, “The way the RSS expressed joy over Mahatma Gandhi’s death had worsened the situation, leaving the government with no choice but to act against it. Reports confirmed that the activities of the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha created an atmosphere that led to Gandhi’s assassination.”Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, Kharge accused the Modi government of rewriting history and distorting the legacy of national icons. “On 9th July 2024, the Modi government lifted the 58-year-old ban on government employees participating in RSS activities. We demand that this lifting be set aside.The organisation was banned by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” he said.Kharge criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for what he described as attempts to distort history.“Recently, references to Mahatma Gandhi, Godse, the RSS, and the 2002 Gujarat riots have been removed from NCERT books. Erasing the truth from textbooks is not right—it reveals their intentions. They always try to turn lies into truth. Our Prime Minister is an expert in this, and his followers are walking the same path. Sardar Patel had banned the RSS to protect secularism,” he said.Responding to PM Modi’s remarks on Sardar Patel’s role in uniting Kashmir, Kharge said the Prime Minister was trying to create a false divide between Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. “They always tried to portray a rift between Nehru and Patel when they had great ties and both had praised each other,” Kharge said, adding that Patel had called Nehru “an ideal for the country.”","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge calls for a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Citing Sardar Patel’s letter to Syama Prasad Mookerjee dated 4 February 1948, he added, “The way the RSS expressed joy over Mahatma Gandhi”s death had worsened the situation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124989092,imgsize-959067,width-400,resizemode-4/kharge-during-a-press-conference-in-new-delhi.jpg"

India backs Turkiye rival Cyprus





NEW DELHI: India backed Afghanistan's announcement that it will build a dam on the Kunar river, saying it stands ready to support Afghanistan in sustainable water management, including on hydroelectric projects. Amidst Afghanistan-Pakistan tensions, the govt also reiterated its position that it is fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.On the dam issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there's a history of cooperation between India and Afghanistan on such issues, including the Salma Dam in Herat province.Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region, raising concerns in Islamabad about likely restriction on the flow of water into the country. Pakistan is faced with similar concerns emanating from India's decision to put in abeyance the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a Word Bank-brokered water sharing agreement between the two countries, after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. Pakistan seems to think that it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity.Its neighbors find it unacceptable. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" said the Indian official.Govt rejected OIC’s latest statement on J&K, saying the group had no locus standi to comment on issues internal to India. “Regarding the statement made by the OIC secretariat, we reject those statements. They don’t have any locus standi to speak on matters which are internal to India,” said the MEA spokesperson.The OIC general secretariat had released a statement Monday in which it reiterated “full solidarity with the people of J&K in their legitimate quest for the right to self-determination”.Amidst India’s strained relationship with Turkiye, MEA S Jaishankar reiterated New Delhi’s “unwavering” support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Republic of Cyprus, which does not have diplomatic ties with Ankara, in line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

Buckingham Palace Hit By Epstein Storm: UK Royals Clash Over; King Charles Strips Andrew

What happened

What is next for Andrew





King Charles III, on Thursday, has stripped his brother Andrew of his ‘prince’ title and has ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.The move follows weeks of mounting pressure and public scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said, as cited by AP. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”The announcement came amid mounting outrage after Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reiterated her sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew, claims that he continues to deny.The claims were detailed in her posthumously published memoir, where she recounts how Epstein allegedly trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was just 17.Andrew, 65, has consistently denied Giuffre’s allegations but withdrew from royal duties following a widely criticised BBC interview in November 2019, where he sought to defend himself against her claims.Also read: A look at Prince Andrew's former roles and crown perks he’s losing In 2022, he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement after Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against him in New York. Though Andrew made no admission of guilt, he expressed regret for Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.In a 2019 BBC interview, Andrew said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media tycoon and former MP Robert Maxwell, since her university days.It was Maxwell who introduced him to her then-partner, Jeffrey Epstein, in 1999. The three maintained a close friendship, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Andrew is also alleged to have personally invited Epstein and Maxwell to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, that same year, as cited by The Independent.In June this year, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a New York court for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.In a separate development, reports this week also revealed that Prince Andrew had hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge during his daughter Beatrice’s birthday celebrations in 2006, just two months after a US arrest warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor, as cited by the BBC.Andrew is expected to relocate to a property on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, with the move to be privately funded by King Charles.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also vacate Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements.Formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was issued on Thursday, and Andrew’s move to Sandringham is expected to take place “as soon as practicable.” He will receive a private allowance from the King, while any additional income will be his own responsibility, as reported by The Guardian.Also read: King Charles boots Prince Andrew out of Windsor home, strips all titles over Epstein links Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will keep their royal titles, and he remains eighth in line to the throne.It marks the most dramatic royal exit since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were granted the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile.In contrast, Prince Harry, despite stepping back from royal duties, moving to California, and his ongoing rift with the family, still retains his title as Prince and Duke of Sussex.","King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his 'prince' title and ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.

Erika Kirk Cries As Late Husband Charlie’s Voice Echoes Through The Stage | WATCH

JD Vance-Usha Vance rumors







Vice President JD Vance came under a lot of fire Thursday after he sided with Christianity and expressed his wish that his Hindu wife Usha Vance who, according to JD is not a very religious person, embrace Christianity. JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.It was a major MAGA implosion moment as social media users started 'shipping' JD Vance with Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk -- politically and also romantically.A few weeks ago, MAGA commentators floated the idea of a Vance-Kirk ticket for 2028 -- JD Vance being the presidential candidate and Erika Kirk, the VP candidate. JD Vance is currently the top choice for the 2028 presidential candidate, apart from Marco Rubio. But in the past few weeks, support for Vance-Kirk grew louder for Vance-Rubio. But after Vance addressed the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the chatter took a different turn and many MAGA supporters insinuated that JD Vance will divorce Usha Vance and will remarry Erika Kirk before his 2028 run because they argued that JD Vance knows America will not accept a 'Hindu First Lady'.The photo of Erika Kirk and JD Vance hugging invited criticism for Erika Kirk as well as she was accused of cosying up with JD Vance on the stage.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently made some comments about JD Vance and his relationship with Usha Vance saying that Usha is scared of him. ""I think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance, wants to be president more than anything else,"" Psaki said. ""I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you,"" Jen Psaki said.""And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him,"" Psaki said.JD Vance said the comments are disgraceful, but the Second Lady can speak for herself. ""I am very lucky to have a wonderful wife. I hope that my wife feels the same about me. We will keep on serving the country together,"" JD Vance recently said when he was in Israel with his wife.","JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.

FBI swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue





Possible connection to ISIS

Political reaction









A potential ISIS-inspired attack in Michigan was foiled just hours before Halloween, after FBI arrested multiple suspects allegedly plotting a “pumpkin day” assault, reports CNN.The operation was carried out early Friday, preventing what director Kash Patel described as a “violent attack” planned for the holiday weekend.The plan was uncovered after months of online surveillance of a chatroom where several men allegedly discussed carrying out an ISIS-inspired attack in US. According to officials, an undercover FBI operative had been inserted into the group during the early stages of planning.The suspects had recently gone to a shooting range armed with AK-47s and other weapons, practising tactical reloads and firing dozens of rounds. That was when investigators intercepted a spooky reference to “pumpkin day” — believed to be a coded term for Halloween. This led the FBI to act immediately.“This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.“Thanks to the men and women of FBI and law enforcement everywhere standing guard 24/7 and crushing our mission to defend the homeland.”Raids were conducted in the Detroit suburbs, where heavily armed FBI and Michigan State Police teams stormed at least three homes. Investigators seized several legally owned firearms, computers and mobile devices as part of their operation.“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” according to CNN’s chief law enforcement analyst John Miller, citing briefings from officials.At least two suspects have been arrested, while three others are being questioned. Among them, one was identified as a 16-year-old juvenile. The group had allegedly debated the timing of their attack, with some members pushing to strike on Halloween, while others argued they needed more time to prepare.Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she had been briefed on the arrests and thanked authorities for their swift action. “This morning, I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” Whitmer posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed operations in Dearborn and Inkster, saying, “There is no current threat to public safety.” The Dearborn Police Department also reassured residents that there was “no threat to the community.”Investigators are now probing any links between the arrested individuals and 19-year-old former Michigan Army National Guardsman Ammar Said, who was detained in May for plotting an ISIS-inspired attack on a US Army facility in Warren, Michigan.Officials described the Michigan cell as “home-grown radicals” with possible overseas connections, and credited close surveillance and quick coordination for preventing what could have been a Halloween tragedy.",Multiple suspects arrested in Michigan for allegedly plotting 'pumpkin day' attack.

Kash Patel pays reimbursement in advance: FBI









The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire. This time, the FBI issued a detailed statement comparing Kash Patel's travels with his predecessors, like Chris Wray and James Comey.The FBI director is not allowed to travel in commercial planes and they are only supposed to travel in government planes. Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending. When Patel flies, he chooses to take a government airfield instead of airport like DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) as the government option is 2.5X cheaper.Williamson said Chris Wray, James Comey, for example, never did that and they mostly used DCA.""Kash himself has significantly limited personal travel - but he’s allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend. He doesn’t do it often. He works far more full weekends than he does otherwise.

"In Bihar’s Jawaniya, a river runs where a village once was",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/in-bihars-jawaniya-a-river-runs-where-a-village-once-was/articleshow/125009637.cms,"



Jawaniya (Bhojpur): Rivers give in abundance. But when swollen with fury, they plunder without mercy. This July, the primeval Ganga took everything that belonged to this riverine village in Bhojpur district of Bihar. It became a land grabber, a livelihood snatcher, a home wrecker and, as one gathers after visiting the habitation, a destroyer of dreams. Parts of Jawaniya now look like a lunatic’s playground — houses carved into pieces like cakes, dead bamboo forests and roads that abruptly end before a rivercreated precipice.About 200 homes, two water tanks, two schools and three temples were swallowed in the swirling waters. Over 300 bighas (1 bigha equals to 0.6 acres) of fecund land were gnawed away. Ward No. 5, and much of Ward No. 4, don’t exist anymore. Substantial parts of the village are now deemed unsafe. Jawaniya is comatose. A Void For Home Eighty-one-year-old Sriram Sahu has lived through many floods, but none like this. “I’d never seen so much water, such strong currents,” he says.Vijay Thakur, who lost 90% of his land, affirms. “Flood doesn’t scare us,” he says. “Soil erosion (katav) does. We had never imagined it would be this bad.”Ward member Ashish Pandey says the only mercy was that nobody died. “We managed to empty the homes in advance,” he says. The river has left a gaping hole in every Jawaniya heart. The loss of homes isn’t just financial. The sudden physical erasure of a place — where everyone lived, loved and grew up — has filled most villagers with an unbearable melancholy.“Ghar nahi raha, bas ab ghar ka moh bhar hai (There’s no home anymore, just a yearning for it),” says Sandeep Chaudhary of the EBC Bind community. Like most who lost their homes, his family has moved to a bandh (embankment), over a kilometre away. But, like a restless vagabond, he returns to the riverbank every now and then. The embankment is a narrow strip; barely wide enough to set up a tent.To walk to the other side, you gingerly trudge up the slope. The camps are made of canvas and reed. These are survival units where you’ll find sewing machines, gas cylinders, and old trunks kept messily for lack of space. A man sleeps on a charpoy beside a buffalo while a girl pets a rooster on her lap. “I can endure. But my kids haven’t seen hard times. How can they bear all this?,” says a tearyeyed middle-aged woman. In one of the tents, Sandeep’s younger brother, Vijay, is studying mathematics.He is preparing for his Class 12 examinations. They earlier lived in a concrete home with eight rooms. Four of them have fallen into the river, parts of the remaining half hang in the air like a person standing on one leg. Their father, a sharecropper, had toiled all his life to build the house.Scattered school notebooks and a pitch-black hearth tells the story of a hurried evacuation amid a bed of red hibiscus flowers that looks incongruous in these glum surroundings. The family belongings are stored in four places. Some items are with their married sister, who lives about 20km away; the remaining articles are kept either at a temple, or with a friend. Only the bare necessities are at the embankment.Like some others, the Chaudharys are building a reed hut at some distance from the riverbank. “We haven’t left the village. But the village has left us,” says Sandeep. Weighing Choices Neeraj’s father, Mangru, is not at home. He is campaigning for the BJP candidate, Rakesh Ojha. So is Pawan Thakur, a bhumihar by caste, who owned 20 bighas of land and is now homeless, landless and jobless.A group of eight men have travelled on motorbikes to a nearby village, where UP deputy CM and BJP leader Keshav Prasad Maurya is addressing an election meeting. A village of yadavs, brahmins, binds, gonds (tribals) and bhumihars, Jawaniya has about 1,500 voters. The Shahpur assembly seat, of which it is a part, has been mostly held by RJD. Two-time MLA Rahul Tiwary is now aiming for a hat-trick.Both candidates have visited Jawaniya. Sentiments, barring those among the yadavs, seem more inclined towards Ojha, described as a “naya yuva chehra (a new youthful face)”. Locals say that he ran a langar (free food service) during the floods. Among others who provided relief materials was Bhojpuri singer-actor Pawan Singh, who distributed 1,500 tents and 2,000 bamboo poles. Jan Suraaj leader Prashant Kishor spent Diwali with the villagers. Nearby villages such as Karja Bazaar were also flooded in July. The waters have receded. But in Jawaniya, they have left behind a sandy bed. Earlier the land, locals say, was fit for wheat, pulses, millets and sesame. “Now we can only grow watermelons,” says Neeraj. Jawaniya is conjoined with another village, Chakki Naurangia, both on the BiharUttar Pradesh border. Homes and lands in both villages have been lost forever.“The district administration ran a flood relief camp for two and a half months. Every family received a gratuity of Rs 7,000,” says Tanai Sultania, DM, Bhojpur, over the phone. It is also learnt that house compensation has been partially disbursed and the villagers are likely to be settled in Bilauti, about 30km away. But several villagers said they haven’t received the compensation yet.Vijay Ram, a Dalit, from Chakki Naurangia, stands staring at the river. Like many others, he has moved to the relief camp. The melancholy of loss, he says, lingers. “This village is my birthplace — I keep coming back,” he explains. Today, he has brought his wife to the riverbank. She wanted to see their ‘home’. He points about 200 metres away. “That’s where it was,” he tells her. There’s nothing there, only a river now at peace with itself.","Jawaniya, a village in Bhojpur district of Bihar, was hit hard by floods in July.

KOLKATA: A 32-year-old Titagarh homemaker,originally from Dhaka, died by suicide early on Friday bysetting herself on fire. She had come to India 15 years ago after marrying a Titagarh businessman. The mother of two daughters, she reportedly took the extreme step over fears related to SIR-NRC, her mother-in-law alleged. Police are questioning her husband and in-laws to find out the exact cause of her death.This is the fourth such suicide or suicide attempt in Bengal in the past four days in which the victims’ families have cited SIR and NRC fears as the reason. She was now an Indian citizen, having voted in several elections.Police said Kakoli left behind a suicide note blaming no one for her death but expressing a deep yearning for her family in Dhaka, where she lived before her marriage to Titagarh garment trader Sabuj Sarkar in 2011. Originally from Nababganj in Dhaka, she had been living in India for the past 15 years. Family members told police that Kakoli had all valid Indian documents, including Aadhaar and PAN cards, and regularly voted in elections.“But she often feared she would be sent back to Bangladesh because her name was not on the 2002 voters’ list. After SIR was declared, her anxiety grew,” said her mother-inlaw, Shibani Sarkar.Police said the suicide note read: “No one is responsible for my death… I don’t feel well here. I love my parents, brothers, sisters, and everyone there... so I feel sad. My husband’s family here say this Bangladesh is not good. They ask how Muslims conduct themselves. No one is responsible for my death… I am leaving everyone… Please take care of my two daughters…” Cops said while the woman is Indian, her parents are Bangladeshis.She never visited Bangladesh in the 15 years since her wedding, they said. Locals said Kakoli had argued with her husband on Thursday night after expressing her desire to visit Bangladesh for her brother’s wedding.“Her husband and in-laws reportedly stopped her, citing documentation risks under NRCand SIR. She hadn’t even been able to visit her mother before she passed away a few months ago,” said a neighbour.Police have detained Kakoli’s husband Sabuj, father-inlaw Suresh, and brother-inlaw Shanti for questioning. “They are being interrogated to ascertain the reason behind the death. The suicide note will be examined by forensic experts,” said a Barrackpore Commissionerate officer.Police said Kakoli set herself on fire on the terrace of the two-storey house on KG School Road while other family members were asleep. Her charred body was recovered in the morning and taken to hospital, where she was declared dead.“The note reflected her emotional distress as she could not visit her parents for several years despite repeated attempts,” Barrackpore commissioner of police Murlidhar Sharma told. He said her in-laws provided documents supporting her Indian citizenship. “We are verifying the documents and statements of the family members,” he said.","Kakoli Sarkar, 32, was originally from Nababganj in Dhaka.

Putin 'BOMBS' Ukraine With Russia's 9M729 Cruise Missile; Is This Why Trump Ordered Nuclear Tests?

What is the 9M729?





Russia has, in recent months, used a cruise missile against Ukraine that led US President Donald Trump to withdraw from a key nuclear arms control pact with Moscow back in 2019.The 9M729 missile, reportedly developed in secret, prompted the United States to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during Donald Trump’s first term.Signed in 1987 by-then US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev near the end of the Cold War, the INF Treaty banned all ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.The agreement aimed to reduce the concentration of potentially nuclear-armed weapons deployed by Russia and Nato across Europe, as cited by the Kyiv Independent.Russia has launched the 9M729 missile at Ukraine 23 times since August and had previously fired it twice in 2022, a senior Ukrainian official said, as cited by Reuters.Washington has accused Russia of violating the treaty by developing the 9M729 missile, which it says can travel well beyond the 500 km (310 miles) limit, a claim that Moscow has denied.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Missile Threat project, the missile is capable of carrying either a nuclear or conventional warhead and has a range of up to 2,500 km. One such missile fired by Russia on October 5 flew more than 1,200 km before striking Ukraine, a military official said, as cited by Reuters.""Russia's use of the INF-banned 9M729 against Ukraine in the past months demonstrates (President Vladimir) Putin's disrespect to the United States and President Trump's diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine's foreign minister, said in written remarks to Reuters.Images from the aftermath of a Russian strike on October 5 showed debris from a residential building hit in the Ukrainian village of Lapaiivka, where four people were killed.The village lies more than 600 km from Russian territory, and the fragments included two missile parts, one of them a tube with wiring, both marked 9M729, as reported by Reuters.Meanwhile, Russia has tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile last week and announced on Wednesday that it had also conducted a test of its nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo.Trump on Friday also reaffirmed plans to resume nuclear testing, days after announcing that he had instructed the Pentagon to restart weapons tests.","The 9M729 missile, reportedly developed in secret, prompted the United States to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during Donald Trump’s first term.

Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) on Friday reportedly cursed at police officers and Transportation Security Administration personnel at Charleston International Airport, calling them “f***ing incompetent” and demanding treatment she believed befitted a member of Congress, according to an incident report.The episode took place this week when officers from the Charleston County Aviation Authority Police Department arrived at the ticketing curb at 6.30 am and, finding no sign of the congresswoman, located her around 7 am at a trusted traveller checkpoint.The report says Mace began shouting at officers, insisting “this is no way to treat a US representative” as she was escorted to her gate.“The entire walk to gate B-8 she was cursing and complaining and often doing the same into her phone,” an officer wrote.“After standing in the vicinity of B-8 for several minutes with her continuing her tirade, she finally boarded the aircraft.”Mace called the reports fake news. On X, Mace shared a video of her arrival and challenged media accounts, writing “for the FAKE NEWS: This is the entrance ALL Members of Congress use at the airport. Are you going to write that Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott use the same entrance or no? Or no?”A spokesperson for Mace, Cameron Morabito, told Newsweek via email, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for Governor.We are forced to take the Congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously. After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified.

That’s the federal security protocol.

The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night, as President Donald and Melania Trump hosted a Halloween spectacle straight out of a comic book.Superheroes, dinosaurs, and even pint-sized Trumps and Melanias stormed the South Lawn — while the First Couple, skipping costumes, made a dramatic entrance to the spooky strains of Thriller, AP image.They handed out chocolate to hundreds of costumed children, just hours after the president returned from a five-day swing through Asia.The Trumps took a particular liking to three siblings dressed as a Secret Service agent, the President and the First Lady.Trump gave his doppelganger a high-five before asking the trio to turn around and pose for photographs. The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Thanksgiving travel at risk

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

US President Donald Trump on Friday reaffirmed that the US would resume nuclear testing, following his announcement this week that he was directing the Pentagon to restart the weapons tests.While talking with reporters on Air Force One in midair, Trump gave an indirect answer when asked whether he would include the traditional underground nuclear tests that were common during the Cold War.“You’ll find out very soon. But we’re going to do some testing, yeah,” Trump said on Air Force One. “Other countries do it. If they’re going to do it, we’re going to do it. I’m not going to say here.”On Wednesday, Trump directed the Pentagon to immediately begin testing US nuclear weapons on an equal basis to China and Russia. “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” the President wrote in a Truth Social post.“This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”The announcement came less than an hour before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on trade.Trump initially ignored a question from a reporter on the announcement during his meeting with Xi, but told reporters afterwards that the news “had to do with others” when asked whether it had to do with Xi.“They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody,” the President said. “We don’t do testing, and we halted it many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” he continued.North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s. Russia has been testing nuclear-capable weapons, which does not include setting off actual bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been testing missiles capable of having nuclear warheads as recently as this week.The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, most of them in Nevada, before halting amid growing environmental concerns and Cold War fatigue.During the 1950s, above-ground tests escalated tensions with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower announced a pause in testing in 1958, assuming the Soviet Union would reciprocate, Axios reported.When the Soviets resumed tests in 1961, the US followed suit. In 1963, the US, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to end tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater, driven by environmental concerns and fallout from the Cuban Missile Crisis.The Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 limited underground tests to yields below 150 kilotons. In 1992, Congress passed a resolution prohibiting underground nuclear tests unless another state conducted one, establishing the current moratorium. President Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1997, but the Senate rejected ratification on national security grounds. Globally, as of August 2025, 187 state parties have signed the CTBT and 178 have ratified it.The US has signed — but not ratified — the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, leaving President Trump free under law to resume nuclear testing. His announcement has revived painful memories of the Cold War era, when open-air detonations sickened thousands across the American West. Lawmakers from Nevada, which hosted hundreds of tests, condemned the plan as both a public health hazard and a geopolitical provocation that could “lead to World War III,"" Politico reported.Experts argue there’s no technical need for renewed testing, noting the US already certifies its nuclear arsenal as safe through advanced simulations and experiments. Each new test could cost $140 million and risk reigniting global tensions. Trump allies, however, claim testing would project strength to China and Russia. Analysts warn such a move could alienate US allies, undermine nuclear restraint, and spark a new arms race just as key arms control treaties near expiration.","US President Donald Trump on Friday reaffirmed that the US would resume nuclear testing.

US President Donald Trump instructed his administration’s lawyers to seek court clarification on legally funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP) after federal judges ordered the use of emergency funds in November to cover food stamp benefits.The rulings by federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island rejected a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) claim that it could not use a contingency fund to help cover the benefits, which were due to start distribution tomorrow amid the monthlong govt shutdown.“I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,"" the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.“It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out. If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,"" Trump added.He demanded the Democrats to quit this, and immediately reopen the government and warned, ""If you use SNAP benefits, call the Senate Democrats, and tell them to reopen the Government, NOW! Here is Cryin’ Chuck Schumer’s Office Number: (202) 224-6542.""Two federal judges on Friday ordered the federal govt to use contingency funds to maintain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing shutdown, following legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general and governors in 25 states and the District of Columbia, AP reported.In Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case brought by cities and non-profit organisations that the programme must be funded using at least the contingency funds and asked for a progress update by Monday. He also ordered that all existing waivers of SNAP work requirements, which the USDA had terminated for older adults, veterans and others, continue to be honoured.In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued a written opinion calling the USDA’s suspension of benefits “unlawful” and directed the federal govt to inform the court by Monday whether it would use the emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the programme using both contingency funds and additional resources. “Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” she wrote. “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP programme.”The administration said it wasn’t allowed to use a contingency fund of about $5 billion for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, but that it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.",Two federal judges on Friday ordered the federal govt to use contingency funds to maintain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing shutdown.

'She Has No Plans To Convert': JD Vance Clarifies Amid Row Over Remark On Wife's Faith





As Vice President JD Vance addressed the row over his statement about his wife Usha Vance's religion and made it clear that it was her faith that helped him reconnect with his own religion, the Hindu American Foundation asked the VP why he never thought of engaging with Hinduism as well. The organization said that, given the present anti-Hindu sentiment online, his public acknowledgement of the positive impact of Hinduism on him would be more reasonable.Accused of throwing his wife's religion under the bus, JD Vance said it's disgusting to interpret his statement in this way. JD Vance said Usha Vance is not a Christian and has no plans to convert but like many people in an interfaith marriage or an interfaith relationship, he hopes that she may one day see things as he does. ""Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" Vance said, adding that Usha is the most amazing blessing in his life and she encouraged him to re-engage with his faith.In 2019, JD Vance was baptized, years after his marriage to Usha Vance. Before that, he was an agnostic, as he called himself. He said Usha was also an agnostic when they first met.Vance defended his hope to see his wife converted and called it a Christian belief. ""Yes, Christians have beliefs. And yes, those beliefs have many consequences, one of which is that we want to share them with other people. That is a completely normal thing, and anyone who's telling you otherwise has an agenda,"" Vance said.But the religion controversy did not end with Vance's statement. The Hindu American Foundation expected him to engage with Hinduism.""If you did you may well learn that Hinduism doesn’t share the need to wish your spouse comes around to see things as you do in terms of religion. Hinduism is inherently inclusive and pluralistic in this way. We do not seek to convert anyone. We embrace the idea that there are multiple ways of conceiving of the Divine. Yet, there remains a compulsion, from some religious communities, to convert us to another way of thinking, that goes beyond mere dialog and sharing of differing opinions,"" the foundation said.HAF countered the belief that the path of salvation is only through Christ and asked if Hindus in America do not have religious freedom. ""Some of the most vocal voices in your base seem to not actually believe religious freedom — one of the core concepts this nation was founded upon, as you well know — should extend to Hindus,"" it said.","JD Vance said Usha Vance is not a Christian and has no plans to convert.

Former vice president Kamala Harris went on a furious rant on President Donald Trump , slamming his decision to build a new $300 million ballroom at the White House, demolishing the East Wing, while millions of Americans face the loss of food aid during the ongoing government shutdown.Speaking on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart podcast, Harris accused Trump of prioritising luxury over lives. “Are you f--king kidding me?” she said angrily. “This guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while completely turning a blind eye to the fact that babies are going to starve when the SNAP benefits end in just hours from now. Come on.”She went on to criticise what she described as Trump’s obsession with image and excess. “I’m not going to be distracted by, ‘Oh, does the guy have a big f--king hammer?’ What about those babies?” Harris said, drawing a contrast between the lavish project and struggle of low-income families.The MAGA chief's ballroom project is estimated to cost around $300 million and involves tearing down the East Wing of the White House to make way for a 90,000-square-foot hall. The White House has maintained that the expansion is funded entirely by private donors and no taxpayer money is used, but Democrats have denounced it as wasteful and tone-deaf amid the cost-of-living crisis.The shutdown has already jeopardised federal food assistance for nearly 40 million Americans and threatens to raise healthcare costs as subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire.Harris urged action on behalf of working families, pointing out what she called Trump’s misplaced priorities. “It costs $8 billion to keep SNAP going for poor children? Come on. And taxpayer dollars, by the way,” she said, referencing Trump’s earlier $20 billion bailout to Argentina.","Former vice president went on a furious rant on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart podcast.

I'm a public figure, and people are curious, and I wasn't going to avoid the question,"" the Vice President said.After calling Usha Vance an agnostic , for which JD Vance was called a liar, the Vice President clarified that Usha has no plans to convert. ""...my Christian faith tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings. My wife--as I said at the TPUSA--is the most amazing blessing I have in my life.She herself encouraged me to reengage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage--or any interfaith relationship--I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" he asserted.JD Vance said it is completely normal for Christians to want to share their beliefs with others. ""Yes, Christians have beliefs. And yes, those beliefs have many consequences, one of which is that we want to share them with other people. That is a completely normal thing, and anyone who's telling you otherwise has an agenda,"" Vance said.","Vice President JD Vance broke his silence after relentless attacks on social media over his comment on how he wishes his wife Usha Vance, a born Hindu, would embrace his religion, Christianity.

The Big Picture



Driving the News



Why It Matters



Can Trump Actually Do It?



In 2013, Democrats led by Harry Reid scrapped the filibuster for most executive-branch nominees.

In 2017, Republicans under Mitch McConnell extended that change to Supreme Court nominations.





As the US government shutdown drags on, Donald Trump has demanded that Senate Republicans “play their TRUMP CARD” and get rid of the filibuster. But what exactly is this rule, why does it matter, and can a president really make it vanish?In a late-night Truth Social post, President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans to “end the filibuster,” the rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation, to break the deadlock over government funding.Republicans currently control 53 of the 100 Senate seats, short of the 60 needed to overcome Democratic opposition. Trump’s demand revives a long-running Washington debate about whether the Senate’s tradition of extended debate protects democracy or paralyses it.The filibuster is a procedural rule unique to the US Senate that allows a minority of senators to delay or block a bill by continuing debate indefinitely. To end debate and move to a final vote, the Senate must invoke “cloture”, which needs three-fifths of the chamber, or 60 votes.Originally meant to protect the rights of the minority, the filibuster has become a tool of partisan gridlock. Today, senators rarely hold the floor for hours as in the past; simply threatening to filibuster is enough to stall legislation.As a result, most major bills need bipartisan support to pass.Only budget reconciliation bills, which deal with taxes or spending, can bypass the filibuster and pass with a simple majority.Facing a shutdown that has frozen federal programs and threatened health-care subsidies, Trump called on Republicans to “play their TRUMP CARD” and eliminate the filibuster entirely.The president’s message came after Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill, demanding the reinstatement of certain health-insurance subsidies linked to the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have so far resisted calls to change the rule, saying the White House has not formally pressed them to do so.This is not Trump’s first clash with the filibuster. During his first term he also demanded its removal to speed up legislation, but Senate Republicans then, as now, declined to take that step.Getting rid of the filibuster would reshape the Senate and the balance of power in Washington.Short-term effect: Republicans could pass spending bills and other legislation with 51 votes, ending the shutdown without Democratic support.Long-term risk: Once the rule is gone, Democrats could use the same simple-majority standard if they regain control, advancing sweeping policies opposed by conservatives.That is why many senators, including traditionalists in both parties, are wary of what is known as the “nuclear option.” They fear it would destroy the Senate’s character as a deliberative body designed to slow down the legislative process and force consensus.No. The president cannot unilaterally change Senate rules.Under the US Constitution, each chamber of Congress sets its own rules. The only way to eliminate or weaken the filibuster is for a majority of senators to vote for a rule change or to create a new procedural precedent, often referred to as the “nuclear option.”This has been used before:But those moves applied only to appointments, not legislation. Extending the “nuclear option” to all bills would be a much bigger and more controversial step.Given the current numbers, Republicans would need at least 51 votes to make that change. Several GOP senators, including moderates, have expressed opposition, meaning Trump’s call may remain symbolic unless the party unites behind him.What’s NextUnless the rule changes, the 60-vote threshold remains in place, forcing both sides to negotiate a funding compromise to reopen the government.If Republican leaders sense growing political damage from the shutdown, pressure may mount to test the “nuclear option.” But doing so could permanently alter how the Senate works and change how every future president, Democrat or Republican, governs.For now, the filibuster stands: part guardrail, part chokehold, and a reminder that in Washington, breaking the rules is always easier to say than to do.","The filibuster is a procedural rule unique to the US Senate that allows a minority of senators to delay or block a bill by continuing debate indefinitely.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

What Afghanistan said







Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating. The border has now been shut for over two weeks, allowing only expelled Afghans to cross, leaving goods stranded and spoiling in places like Spin Boldak.","Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources. The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124896758,imgsize-517334,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.
