REVEALED: Modi Spoke to Trump for 35 Mins, Then All Hell Broke Loose | INSIDE DETAILS | India

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which is to take place in New York City.According to the provisional list of speakers for the high-level debate of the 80th session of the General Assembly, India’s “Head of Government (HG)” will address the session on the morning of September 26, reported news agency PTI.The Heads of Government of Israel, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are also scheduled to address the UNGA general debate on the same day. PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska."" ""Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Putin’s trip to Alaska will be his first to the US in a decade. The last time Russia’s leader was in the country for a meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015 with then-President Barack Obama.The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters he planned to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine with Putin. The President expressed cautious optimism, saying he believes “we have a shot” at brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.The 80th session of the UNGA will open on September 9. The high-level General Debate will run from September 23-29, with Brazil as the traditional first speaker of the session, followed by the US.US President Donald Trump will address world leaders from the iconic UNGA podium on September 23, his first address to the UN session in his second term in the White House.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York City.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said on Tuesday that a journalist's news article or video is prima facie not an act endangering the unity and integrity of the country to invite a charge under Section 152 of BNS, the modified version of the 'sedition' offence under IPC Section 124A.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said this while protecting from arrest the editor of news website 'The Wire', Siddharth Varadarajan, and members of the 'Foundation of Independent Journalism' in an FIR registered by Assam Police on a complaint accusing the editor of writing seditious articles by reporting about the alleged loss of IAF jets during Operation Sindoor . The scribe said he wrote the report quoting India's defence personnel, including the country's military attache to Indonesia.The bench said, ""For writing articles or preparing news videos, should journalists get entangled in cases? Should it require arrests?""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the petition filed by the journalist challenging the validity of Section 152 is a camouflage to avoid accountability.Justice Kant said, ""We are not classifying journalists as a separate class. However, does an article pose an imminent threat to the unity and integrity of the country? It is an article, not like someone is smuggling illegal arms and ammunition into India.""On the petitioners' allegation that Section 152 does not define which acts constitute an offence under the provision, Justice Kant said, ""How can it be legislatively defined as to which all acts would constitute an offence of endangering the unity and integrity of the country? Law has to be applied to facts of each case to determine whether the charge under Section 152 is correct. Inviting the legislature to define what endangers national unity and integrity will be inviting danger. ""Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Nithya Ramakrishnan said they have also challenged the validity of BNS Section 152, which is nothing but a refined version of the draconian Section 124A, the operation of which was virtually stayed by SC pending adjudication of its validity by a five-judge bench.The court did not accept her second line of argument that Section 152 was prone to misuse and abuse by police. ""Is potential abuse or misuse of a provision of law by authorities a valid ground to declare that provision of law unconstitutional? There is a vast difference between implementation of a law and power to legislate,"" Justice Bagchi said.Justice Kant's response was similar. ""Any good law, declared constitutional by SC, can be misused or abused by police authorities. Should that be a ground to declare the law unconstitutional? SC ruling in the Kedar Nath Singh (1962 case) continues to hold the field and in which SC had ruled that the crime of sedition is restricted to 'actual violence or incitement to violence' against the govt.""Senior advocate Ramakrishnan said that the word 'sedition' is not there in Section 152 but for all other purposes the intent of the provision is identical to Section 124A and is being increasingly used to harass journalists.The bench reluctantly agreed to tag this petition with a petition by S G Vombatkere, who has also challenged the validity of Section 152 and whose earlier petition challenging Section 124A is pending adjudication.","A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said this while protecting from arrest the editor of news website 'The Wire' The bench said, ""For writing articles or preparing news videos, should journalists get entangled in cases?

‘Step Back on Humane Policy’ Rahul Gandhi Criticises SC Ruling on Stray Dog Relocation

On June 30, six-year-old Chhavi Sharma, known as Bittu, was bitten by a stray dog while walking to her aunt’s house in northwest Delhi’s Pooth Kalan. Her family says the dog attacked without provocation, leaving her bleeding on the doorstep. She was taken to Dr B R Ambedkar Hospital for anti-rabies treatment, but her health worsened in mid-July.On July 21, her first day back at school, she began vomiting, lost strength in her limbs, and stopped speaking. Four days later, just before she was due for her final vaccine dose, she died.For her family, the Supreme Court’s order on Monday to remove stray dogs from all Delhi localities and place them in shelters is not only a policy decision but also a form of justice.""We don't want even our enemies to go through what we underwent. With the Supreme Court's decision, we believe that our child's death has not gone in vain,"" said Krishna Devi, Chhavi’s aunt, as quoted by PTI.""I feel like my child is the change. I hope there are no more Chhavis, who are hurt elsewhere. Nobody should go through the cruel fate we underwent,"" she said.The Supreme Court described the stray dog situation in Delhi as “extremely grim” and directed the Delhi government and civic bodies to immediately start picking up stray dogs and keeping them in shelters.It also warned of strict action against anyone obstructing the process.Chhavi’s family said the order brought them some relief. ""We heard about the Supreme Court's verdict on TV. The first thing we felt was a sigh of relief. Now I hope they take these animals to places where they can't hurt us,"" Krishna Devi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.""Just like gaushalas (cowsheds) are built for cows, something must be built for these dogs. We are not fighting the animals; we just want them kept separate so they don't hurt us. And those who feed them should be made accountable — they feed them on the streets and leave, and these dogs form packs and chase children,"" she added.Another family in the city has also faced a similar incident. Dheeraj Ahuja, a resident of Ashok Vihar, said his seven-year-old son, who often fed stray dogs, was mauled by one in their neighbourhood.""We welcome this Supreme Court order. It is a great, though delayed, step. My son, who is in Class 7, had to take 10 injections. The child who once fed these dogs was brutally attacked,"" he said, as quoted by PTI.Ahuja also addressed those opposing the order. ""They should come forward, adopt these dogs and keep them in their homes.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Russell Wilson's wife Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.","Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

YouTuber behind viral predator stings loses Roblox account overnight

Roblox says “good intentions” don’t override safety rules

Schlep takes his fight to Senator Ted Cruz

A viral flashpoint for gaming, safety, and free speech

Schlep, a YouTuber who built his online following by hunting alleged “predators” inside Roblox, is now in the headlines for a very different reason. The 22-year-old creator’s Roblox account has been terminated, and he says the gaming giant has sent him a cease and desist letter threatening possible legal action.On August 10, 2025, Schlep took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that his Roblox account was gone. Alongside the announcement, he posted screenshots of what he says is a cease and desist notice from Roblox Corporation accusing him of “unauthorized and harmful activities” on the platform.The letter accused him of violating Roblox’s rules by engaging in staged child-endangerment chats, posting identifiable information, and moving conversations off-platform.Schlep’s videos, popular on YouTube, often showed him posing as minors to bait adults attempting inappropriate contact. He claims his work has helped lead to six arrests across the United States. Roblox, however, said the methods crossed the line, arguing they interfered with official safety measures.In the notice, Roblox reportedly acknowledged that Schlep’s stated goal was protecting children.

Martina Navratilova blasts Donald Trump over Mike Tyson’s rape case comments

“proud sexual assaulter”

Martina Navratilova responds to Trump’s recent accusations amid Epstein file controversy

US President Donald Trump's controversial statement about boxer Mike Tyson has resulted in Martina Navratilova, a tennis star, condemning him more recently. This occurred as Trump is under rising queries over his relationships with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who passed in prison in August 2019. The remark Trump made concerned Mike Tyson's 1992 rape conviction. Navratilova called out Trump for always defending men accused of sexual crimes, calling him a “proud sexual assaulter and an adjudicated rapist.”Six years in jail was Mike Tyson's sentence in 1992 when he was convicted of raping a beauty pageant candidate aged 18. Donald Trump then surprised several by claiming the penalty was too severe on Late Night with David Letterman. Trump also accused the young woman, claiming she was ""dancing at his door at one o'clock in the morning."" These phrases enraged people since they looked to absolve Tyson's crime.Years later, in August 2025, an X (previously Twitter) user reposted Trump's previous remarks. Having been very vocal against Trump for years, Martina Navratilova saw this and reacted strongly.She wrote on X that Trump has always made excuses for rapists like Tyson. Navratilova, a Czech-American and winner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles, has never been shy about speaking out. She called Trump aand said he has a long history of defending men accused of sexual violence.Also Read: “More than any American Culture”: Martina Navratilova once shared how Chris Evert’s Catholic upbringing shaped her tennis image In July 2025, Donald Trump made new shocking claims. He said that his name was wrongly put in Jeffrey Epstein’s secret files by former FBI Director James B. Comey, former US Attorney General Merrick Garland, and former President Joe Biden. Trump called the situation “a hoax” and accused those leaders of trying to hurt him. This was reported by American lawyer Ron Filipkowski on X.Martina Navratilova responded to Filipkowski's post by saying Trump's assertions demonstrate his ""fear."" Navratilova, 68, keeps speaking out against Trump's words and deeds even when his admirers attack her. She champions survivors of abuse and violence and remains steadfast in pointing out what she considers to be wrong.Her blunt choice of words showed raw frustration, not just with Trump’s remarks, but with a culture that often excuses powerful men making her message resonate far beyond the tennis court.",Martina Navratilova blasts Donald Trump over Mike Tyson’s rape case comments.

LUCKNOW: Balrampur police arrested two men in connection with the gangrape of a 22-year-old deaf-mute woman in the Bahadurpur, Dehat Kotwali area of Balrampur district. The arrests followed an encounter in the early hours of Wednesday.The incident occurred on the night of August 11, came to light especially after CCTV footage of the victim fleeing her assailants went viral on social media. The suspects, identified as Ankur Verma (21) and Harshit Pandey (22), sustained injuries during a police chase when they attempted to evade capture.Police are continuing to investigate the possibility of additional individuals being involved in the crime. According to police reports, on the fateful day the victim was returning home from her maternal grandparents' residence around 8 PM when she was allegedly accosted by a young man and forcibly taken to a secluded field.Due to her inability to speak or hear, she was left defenseless and traumatized. Her family, alarmed by her failure to return home by 9 PM, initiated a search and discovered her unconscious in the field. She was promptly transported to the district women's hospital, where medical professionals have since stabilized her condition.Superintendent of Police (SP) Vikash Kumar confirmed that an FIR was filed immediately, and a manhunt for the perpetrators was launched.The victim has been able to convey some details of the ordeal through gestures, with experts brought in to aid the investigation.""We meticulously reviewed CCTV footage and traced the registration numbers of the motorcycles used by the suspects, which led to the formation of dedicated teams to apprehend them,"" SP Kumar stated.On Tuesday night, investigators identified Ankur Verma and Harshit Pandey as the individuals involved in the crime. An alert was issued, and efforts to capture the duo intensified. At approximately 12:30 AM on Wednesday, the suspects were spotted near the outskirts of the Kotwali Dehat police station area, allegedly attempting to flee to Nepal.When confronted, they opened fire on the pursuing officers, prompting a retaliatory response that resulted in their injuries. Subsequently, both suspects surrendered and confessed to the crime.A crucial piece of evidence, a 14-second video from a camera near the SP's residence, has surfaced on social media, showing the victim in distress. This footage is now central to the ongoing investigation.","A 22-year-old deaf-mute woman was gangraped in a field in Balrampur district, Uttar Pradesh.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rajiv Pratap Rudy extended his 25-year leadership of the Constitution Club, defeating fellow BJP MP Sanjeev Balyan in a closely watched election that saw participation from top political figures, including BJP's Amit Shah and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi.Celebrating past midnight with supporters, Rudy said to news agency ANI ""I may have won by more than 100 votes. And if that is multiplied by 1000 voters, then the number goes upto 1 lakh. This is my panel's victory. Everyone rose from their party and cast their vote. My panel had people from the Congress, SP, TMC and independent MPs. I got the result of my efforts in the last two decades.""""It's a beautiful victory for all the parliamentarians and all those who came to vote and endorse the relentless effort of the team for last two decades... It's a beautiful experience,"" Rudy said.What had traditionally been a low-key election turned high-profile this year, with Balyan entering the race and receiving visible backing from BJP MP Nishikant Dubey.The contest drew votes from prominent leaders like Union Ministers JP Nadda, Piyush Goyal, and Kiren Rijiju, alongside Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, and Himachal Pradesh Governor Shiv Pratap Shukla.Though Balyan’s campaign gained momentum, Dubey’s strong anti-Congress stance reportedly piqued the interest of many opposition members—possibly giving Rudy an edge, observers noted. The Saran MP retained solid support within BJP ranks.Out of 1,295 eligible MPs, 679 voted in person and 38 via postal ballots, with total turnout crossing 60%.“When Congress leader Sonia ji arrived along with Kharge saheb, and from our party Amit Shah ji and Nadda saheb came, the true spirit of democracy was seen in the Constitution Club elections,” Rudy said.“For the first time, people learned about an institution called the Constitution Club, a body of MPs and former MPs with history and dignity,” Balyan said, adding, “The country now knows of its existence, and I hope MPs will engage more actively.”Rudy, who has previously defeated Rabri Devi and Rohini Acharya in Saran, cited his contributions in upgrading the Club’s infrastructure and status to justify his re-election. Balyan, known for his grassroots connect, had pitched reform—urging the Club to focus on serving MPs and ex-MPs rather than “outsiders” such as IAS and IPS officers.Congress’s AP Jithender Reddy and Rajiv Shukla, along with DMK’s Tiruchi Siva, were elected unopposed to key posts. The Lok Sabha Speaker continues as the ex-officio president of the Club.","Rajiv Pratap Rudy extended his 25-year leadership of the Constitution Club.

But her ambition collided with the walls of age-old fears. Police said her uncle, Shivram Chaudhary, decided that sending her to study would bring ""shame"" — fearing she might fall in love and marry by choice. Instead of seeing her future, he saw dishonour.Her partner, Haresh, told police and TOI, ""Chandrika's uncle, Shivram, visited some colleges and saw boys and girls studying together. He told her father she should not be sent there as she might fall in love with a boy and marry him. They took away her phone, cut her off from social media, and made her do only household chores.""According to the FIR, on June 24, Shivram, acting on instructions from Chandrika's father, allegedly gave her milk laced with sedatives.When she became drowsy, the duo took her to a storeroom in the house and strangled her with a dupatta. They then staged the scene to make it look like suicide. Police officials said Shivram told some villagers that Chandrika had suffered a heart attack, while told others it was a suicide — asking them not to disclose the truth.Haresh's habeas corpus petition eventually exposed Chandrika's murder. She was killed on June 25. Banaskantha police said the investigation confirmed it was a premeditated killing.

The deceased was identified as Vijay Kumar, a resident of D Group Layout in Machohalli and a native of Magadi.The Madanayakanahalli police have detained the wife of the deceased, identified as Asha, her lover Dhananjay, and a few others, and have subjected them to questioning.According to police, Dhananjay was a childhood friend of Vijay, and both were auto drivers. Vijay was also involved in real estate brokerage, such as helping people rent houses for a commission.Vijay was married to Asha 10 years ago, and the couple have two children.Vijay’s childhood friend Dhananjay used to often visit his house, and over a period of time, he developed a closeness with Asha, leading to an extramarital affair.The couple were earlier living in Kamakshipalya, and after Vijay learned about his wife’s affair with Dhananjay, he shifted his house to D Group Layout in Machohalli. He also warned both Asha and Dhananjay to stop the relationship, but Asha continued to be in contact with Dhananjay.The couple had frequent fights over the issue.Vijay got a few photos of Asha and Dhananjay together.

BENGALURU: When police got a call on Aug 7 about a stray dog trotting around with a human arm dangling from its mouth, they knew they had a murder mystery on their hands. Officers rushed to Chimpuganahalli in Tumakuru district's Koratagere, about 110km from Bengaluru, and began a frantic search for dismembered remains. Scouring a five-km radius, they recovered body parts scattered across 19 different spots. But the head was nowhere to be found.Read also: Bengaluru horror: Domestic help attacks nursing student with machete for commenting on shoddy work; says 'I don't need to be taught by a small girl' The cops had hit the first roadblock as the identity of the victim could not be established. There were neither CCTV cameras nor eyewitnesses. Forensic experts confirmed it was indeed the remains of a woman, and from the jewellery still on the limbs, they concluded it was not a murder for gain. The investigation began with a list of missing women from Tumakuru district.Soon, the name of 42-year-old B Lakshmidevi alias Lakshmidevamma, a homemaker from Bellave, stood out as she had been reported missing by her carpenter-husband Basavaraj. She had last been seen leaving her daughter Tejasvi's home in Hanumantapura on Aug 3.Two days later, the missing head was found in a remote spot in Koratagere and Basavaraj identified it as his wife's.""It was clear that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and a pre-meditated killing, reportedly committed by someone known to the victim,"" a police officer said.Read also: Bengaluru horror: Domestic help attacks nursing student with machete for commenting on shoddy work; says 'I don't need to be taught by a small girl' Superintendent of police Ashok KV formed multiple teams to crack the case. One team discovered that a white sports utility vehicle (SUV) had passed from Hanumantapura in Tumakuru on Aug 3 afternoon and travelled in the direction of Koratagere.A close scrutiny showed that the vehicle had different licence plates in front and back. ""That was the first twist we found. Why would a person run the vehicle with two different number plates, that too fake ones,"" an officer said. This apart, the bonnet's unusual modification helped police link the vehicle to earlier footage. Tracing the original number, they found it belonged to Satish, an agriculturist from Urdigere village in Koratagere. But why was Satish driving a vehicle with false plates through the area where body parts were later found?When police checked Satish's phone records, they found it had been switched off on the afternoon Lakshmidevamma went missing. Again, it was switched off the next day. Local informants recalled seeing the SUV in Satish's agricultural land on Aug 3 and 4. That was enough to summon him for questioning. But Satish was in Chikkamagaluru. A team tailed him in a private vehicle, catching up with him and his associate Kiran at Horanadu temple. Both claimed to be innocent, but were taken back to Tumakuru for interrogation.While another team dug into the SUV's ownership history, a startling detail emerged: the SUV had actually been purchased six months earlier by Dr Ramachandraiah S, a dentist from Tumakuru, but registered in Satish's name. Police learnt that Dr Ramachandraiah had actually married the victim's daughter Tejasvi. On Sunday, officers took Dr Ramachandraiah to the police station for questioning.""To his surprise, we showed him Satish and Kiran. We made them sit face to face and rained questions on them. Satish, unable to hide facts, spilled the beans first. It did not take long for others to confess,"" an officer said.Police said Dr Ramachandraiah's anger had intensified as he suspected Lakshmidevamma of interfering in his marriage, even alleging that she was pressuring her daughter into flesh trade. For the 47-year-old dentist, who was in his second marriage to a woman 20 years younger, this was intolerable. They had a three-year-old child, and he feared Lakshmidevamma would destroy his family. Six months before the murder, he began planning. He purchased the white SUV under Satish's name to avoid detection. He roped in Satish and Kiran with promises of Rs 4 lakh each, paying them Rs 50,000 in advance.On Aug 3, as Lakshmidevamma left Tejasvi's home, Ramachandraiah intercepted her, offering a ride back to Bellave. Inside the SUV, Satish and Kiran lay in wait. Once she was seated, they strangled her to death and drove to Satish's farmland in Kolala. They placed the body in the boot and slept. The next day, the grisly dismemberment began. Using sharp tools, they cut the body into pieces and scattered them across 19 isolated locations, hoping to erase any link between the victim and themselves, police said. ""The dentist had cut the body at joints, limbs and severed the head professionally,"" they added. The trio has been arrested.","B Lakshmidevamma, 42, was reported missing by her carpenter-husband Basavaraj.

No information, no counsel, no help

Sahel shaken by terrorist attacks

Niger's (mis)communication strategy

Burkina Faso: ban on reporting military losses

Signs of slow change in a desert of silence





It has been almost two years since Saratou learned of the death of her son, a young soldier fighting in the Nigerien army. But her pain remains to this day.""There is no solution to death,"" she told DW in Niger's capital, Niamey, clutching a photo of her late son.""Our thoughts are always with our deceased.""It was late September 2023 when Saratou learned of her son's death. An attack on a military unit in Kandadji had occurred. At the time, her son, who had been in the army for just seven months, was stationed in this village, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of Niamey.Saratou tried to find out whether her son was among the 12 soldiers killed, as social media channels were the only source of information available. Eventually, it was a friend of her son who confirmed the unimaginable.With her son's newly pregnant wife, Saratou set off for Kandadji to make the necessary arrangements. Once there, they quickly discovered that his burial had not yet taken place; however, beyond this information, they received no help from the authorities in their darkest hour.""His wife tried everything to at least see his body, but those in charge of the Kandadji camp prevented her from doing so.""In her grief and disappointment, the woman suffered a miscarriage.Their return to Niamey also proved difficult: The two had no money to pay for transport because the salary of the deceased was yet to be paid. His friends collected money for their return trip in the end.Saratou told DW that her son's salary arrived a week later via money transfer. To date, no representative of the army or the government has come to see her.For Seidik Abba, who heads the International Center for Reflection and Studies on the Sahel (CIRES) think tank, Saratou's story is far from an isolated case.""Families often learn of the death of their loved ones through the media or social media. There is no direct channel or mechanism for informing families at an early stage,"" Abba told DW. He contrasted this with the fact that defense ministers or even heads of government offer their condolences to the bereaved in many other countries.In 2024, according to the Global Terrorism Index, the Sahel region had become the epicenter of global terrorism, accounting for 3,885 of a total of 7,555 deaths. However, estimates suggest that the actual number could even be significantly higher, as reliable figures of both civilian and military casualties of terrorism are hard to come by.The core countries of the western Sahel — Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso — have been under military rule for several years. Abba says that it should not come as a surprise that these juntas do not want to draw attention to the decline in safety in the region.""When the military regimes took power, they justified this by citing the deteriorating security,"" said Abba. ""It is obvious that it would be inappropriate for them to communicate regularly. If every incident were reported, it would give the public the impression that the security situation has not improved.""Emery Owolabi, an analyst at the University of Abomey-Calavi in Benin, agrees that reporting military losses would mean that the military junta would have to acknowledge its failures and shortcomings.""In times of war, information is controlled. This lack of transparency is also aimed at preventing demobilization or demoralization of the troops and the population,"" Owolabi told DW.""Instead of uniting the population behind its army, this information could lead to division,"" he added, highlighting that the enormous rate of losses could severely affect morale.An interview with Niger's Defense Minister Salifou Mody on national television aired in January 2025 appears to confirm the experts' assessment. Mody decried that both internal and external players, including the media and NGOs, were allegedly using ""all means not only to discourage our population and our security forces, but also to convey to the outside world that nothing is working in Niger.""DW attempted to secure an interview with Niger's ruling National Council for the Salvation of the Homeland (CNSP) to comment on the ongoing security situation. A written inquiry to its press office has thus far gone unanswered.Neighboring Burkina Faso is the country with the highest terrorism-related death toll, accounting more than 1,500 deaths in 2024 amid a growing displacement crisis throughout the region on top.Here, junta leader Ibrahim Traoré has made silence his doctrine. According to his strategy, announcing losses in the army and the civilian population would be tantamount to providing propaganda for jihadist groups.Journalists reporting on these developments in the country also face arrest if they pass on what might be considered inconvenient information.Heni Nsaibia, a researcher at Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), a global organization that collects data on conflicts worldwide, says that this lack of transparency has resulted in a ""war of narratives.""""On the one side, the military authorities present their version of events. On the other side, jihadist groups spread their own carefully crafted accounts,"" Nsaibia explains.""The official figures, if published at all, are often incomplete and contradictory,"" he added, stressing that this approach also applies to Mali, where the presence of Russian mercenaries and other Russian actors has further exacerbated this opacity.Some observers believe that the situation has begun to change, if only slightly.According to Nigerien political scientist Abdourahmane Alkassoum, Nigerien authorities have become more transparent, particularly in light of pressure following a rise in reports on social media.He highlights a case similar to that of Saratou: Moussa, a 23-year-old soldier, was killed in the town of Diffa in southeastern Niger in the months following its takeover by Islamist Boko Haram fighters from neighboring Nigeria.Like Saratou, Moussa's family has also been suffering painful financial consequences from the loss of their son. According to his mother, Habi, Moussa had been the ""foundation of the family,"" paying for his siblings' school fees, buying food staples like rice and covering hospital bills for his chronically ill brother.The family learned of his death in a Boko Haram attack also through a friend of his. Still, a member of the presidential guard visited them a few weeks later to console them and pledge at least some support for the immediate future.""For several months, they sent us sacks of rice, and we also received a compensation of 300,000 CFA francs (€450 or $530),"" Habi said.By this time, Moussa's funeral in Diffa had long come and gone. His father later got to watch a video of the burial when he finally managed to visit his son's grave — at his own expense","The Sahel region has become the epicenter of global terrorism. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have been under military rule for several years.

What makes a state?

How to become a UN member state





Traditional allies of Israel are increasingly recognizing — or positioning themselves to acknowledge — the existence of Palestine as a state.The Palestinian territories are the focal point of the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.The moves by nations like Australia, France, Canada and potentially the United Kingdom to recognize a Palestinian state, joining around 150 others, will not necessarily bring an end to the war or secure territorial borders.That, as with many other statehood disputes, is because recognized statehood is not a straightforward process.There are states of all shapes, sizes and structures; 193 are currently full members of the United Nations. But not having full UN membership does not preclude those states from participating in the functions of the organization, joining other international bodies and even having diplomatic missions.Nor is UN membership even required to be a state.One of the simplest guides for statehood is outlined in the Convention on Rights and Duties of States — the Montevideo Convention — signed in 1933. It lists four criteria for statehood: defined territorial boundaries, a permanent population, a government representing those people and the ability to enter into international agreementsIt is sometimes said that a state exists when it's recognized by enough people outside its own territory.While recognition isn't a literal part of international conventions, Gezim Visoka, a peace and conflict studies scholar and statehood expert at Dublin City University, Ireland, said it effectively exists through other measures.""Recognition is crucial for a state to function, to exist internationally, to enter international agreements, to benefit from international treaties, protection from annexation, occupations and other forms of arbitrary intervention from abroad,"" said Visoka. ""You're in a better place than if you're not recognized.""Recognition of statehood or fulfilling the Montevideo criteria does not automatically lead to UN admission. The process of becoming a member requires a candidate state to follow several steps: a letter to the UN secretary-general, a formal declaration accepting the UN Charter's membership obligations and the support of the secretary-general.And then, the candidate state must gain the support of members of the UN Security Council. That includes nine of the 15 council members voting in favor of the candidate, and all five of the permanent members: China, France, Russia, the UK and US. Historically, this has been a difficult barrier for candidate states to pass, even for those that have a high level of recognition.Palestine, Kosovo and Western Sahara are among states with extensive recognition but that aren't full UN members.""When Montenegro joined the UN, or Croatia [joined], they had less than 70 recognitions,"" said Visoka. ""Whereas Palestine has almost 150, Kosovo has around 118-119 recognitions, Western Sahara has over 50.""However, if this barrier is passed, a candidate need only receive a two-thirds majority vote of all other UN members at the General Assembly.",Recognition of statehood does not automatically lead to UN admission. Not having full UN membership does not preclude those states from participating in the functions of the organization. Kosovo and Western Sahara are among states with extensive recognition but that aren't full UN members.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123271483,imgsize-935142,width-400,resizemode-4/123271483.jpg"

Data breach: Russian link suspected in US federal court hack; sensitive information compromised in yearlong violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/data-breach-russian-link-suspected-in-us-federal-court-hack-sensitive-information-compromised-in-yearlong-violation/articleshow/123270902.cms,"ANI file photo





Investigators have found evidence linking Russia, at least in part, to a recent breach of the computer system managing federal court documents, which compromised highly sensitive records, including information that could expose sources and individuals charged with national security offences, reported the New York Times.The revelation comes amid US President Donald Trump’s scheduled meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska on Friday, where Trump intends to discuss his efforts to end the war with Ukraine.According to an internal Justice Department memo, court system administrators recently alerted department officials, clerks, and chief judges in federal courts that ""persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records,"" reported the New York Times.Administrators also urged officials to promptly remove the most sensitive documents from the system.It was noted that Rep. Eric Swalwell was behind many of the leaks and had to be advised to be more cautious, RT reported through a post on X.Officials briefed on the matter said documents linked to criminal activity with overseas connections, spanning at least eight district courts, were initially thought to be the focus of the breach.The breach affected federal courts in South Dakota, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, and Arkansas.Chief judges of district courts nationwide were quietly instructed last month to transfer such cases off the standard document-management system and were initially advised not to share the information with other judges in their districts, as per officials briefed on the matter, reported the New York Times.It remains unclear who is responsible for the breach, whether it was carried out by a branch of Russian intelligence, or other nations were also involved.The breach was reportedly a yearlong effort, with some targets searching midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and other jurisdictions, including cases involving individuals with Russian and Eastern European surnames.“This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action,” officials wrote, referencing the guidance issued by the justice department issued in early 2021 following the initial infiltration of the system.Last week, the US court system administrators announced new measures to bolster security across the network, which include the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system for uploading documents and the PACER platform.","Court system administrators recently alerted department officials, clerks, and chief judges in federal courts that ""persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records"" The revelation comes amid US President Donald Trump’s scheduled meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska on Friday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123270967,imgsize-557012,width-400,resizemode-4/123270967.jpg"

Heather Clem was spotted in public weeks after Hulk Hogan’s passing



Bubba the Love Sponge regrets never apologizing to Hulk Hogan



The woman involved in Hulk Hogan ’s notorious s*x tape scandal has been seen in public for the first time since the wrestling legend’s death last month. Heather Clem, now known as Heather Cole, was spotted in Tampa, Florida, on Monday, dressed in a sports bra and yoga pants during a quick stop at a convenience store. Her reappearance comes 19 days after Hogan’s passing from a heart attack at the age of 71.Heather Clem was at the center of one of the most explosive controversies in professional wrestling history. In 2012, Gawker published excerpts from a s*x tape showing her and Hogan, filmed years earlier without the wrestler’s knowledge. At the time, Clem was married to Todd “Bubba the Love Sponge” Clem, a longtime friend of Hogan, and the footage revealed an arrangement between the couple that allowed her to sleep with other men if it was recorded (per TMZ).The tape’s leak triggered a chain of lawsuits. Hogan sued both Bubba and Heather for invasion of privacy, eventually settling with Bubba for $5,000 and an on-air apology. The friendship between Hogan and Bubba, once close, never recovered. Heather and Bubba divorced in 2011, years before the scandal became public.The fallout extended far beyond personal relationships. The leaked footage, paired with audio of Hogan making racist remarks, led WWE to cut ties with him in 2015.Although Hogan later returned to the company, his public image was forever altered.Bubba the Love Sponge has since expressed remorse over the scandal, telling TMZ he regretted not apologizing to Hogan before his death. Brooke Hogan, the wrestler’s daughter, later appeared on Bubba’s radio show and clarified that her father knew Bubba was not the person who leaked the tape.Heather Clem has kept a relatively low profile in recent years. Now 51, she works in the Tampa area as a certified personal trainer specializing in CrossFit and USA Weightlifting. Her Instagram account is private, and many older social media posts have been deleted, though reportedly, some Hogan-related content remains.Also Read: ‘He said some racist things’ – Vince McMahon gives his honest thoughts on Hulk Hogan’s controversial remarks that almost derailed his career Seeing her out in public so soon after Hogan’s death has stirred up memories of the controversial saga.

Where else in Spain are there fires?

Wildfire in Turkey under control

France, UK on alert





Wildfires burned in parts of Europe on Tuesday as millions of people across the continent struggled to adapt to searing heat waves, with temperatures in excess of 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).Spanish broadcaster RTVE reported the death of a man who had suffered severe burns on Monday evening in the Tres Cantos municipality, on the outskirts of Madrid, and died shortly afterwards in hospital. According to the broadcaster, the man was around 50 years old, and 98% of his body was covered in burns.Video footage showed firefighters battling flames in residential areas of Tres Cantos, a municipality north of the Spanish capital.Elsewhere in Spain, firefighters and nearly 1,000 soldiers were battling blazes in regions including Castile and Leon, Castile-La Mancha, Andalusia and Galicia. Thousands of people evacuated homes and hotels, including holiday-goers at beaches in the south of Spain.On Tuesday afternoon, regional authorities announced that some holidaymakers could return to their hotels.Meanwhile, in Portugal, more than 700 firefighters were working to control a fire in the municipality of Trancoso, located about 350 kilometers (217 miles) northeast of Lisbon.Smaller blazes occurred further north.Meanwhile, in northwest Turkey, firefighters had largely brought a major wildfire under control, the authorities announced, a day after the fire prompted hundreds of evacuations and led to the suspension of maritime traffic.The blaze began on agricultural land in Canakkale province. Made worse by strong winds which fanned the flames, it soon spread to a forested area, then to a residential one. It forced the evacuation of 2,000 residents — some by sea — and led to 77 hospitalizations due to smoke exposure, according to officials.Firefighters were still battling two other wildfires in the Manisa and Izmir provinces in western Turkey, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli posted on social media.France's national weather authority placed most of the country's southern region on the highest heat warning, with temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) expected for the second consecutive day.Meanwhile, in the UK authorities are on red alert with temperatures expected to reach 34 Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday and Wednesday, especially in the south of England, including London.Europe is getting hotter faster than any other continent, at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.Last year was the hottest year on record in Europe, the EU's monitoring agency said.According to European Drought Observatory (EDO) data, 52% of Europe and the Mediterranean basin experienced drought for the fourth consecutive month in July.Drought levels in the Mediterranean basin are the highest on record for July since 2012, exceeding the average for that period by 21%.","Wildfires burned in parts of Europe on Tuesday as millions of people struggled to adapt to searing heat waves.

The Southern California police department has recovered around $30,000 worth of Labubu dolls stolen over multiple days, the agency announced this week.The theft involved two suspects, both minors, who were later identified as employees of the warehouse, the Chino police department said through a social media post. The stolen collectibles were recovered by authorities at a residence in Upland, a city located in California’s Inland Empire.“During the investigation, a search warrant was served at a residence in Upland,” an official said, reported ABC News. “One suspect attempted to flee but ultimately surrendered without incident. Detectives recovered fourteen boxes of stolen merchandise, along with evidence indicating the items were being prepared for resale and shipment across the country.”Detectives recovered 14 boxes of stolen goods and found evidence suggesting the pair intended to ship and resell the collectibles nationwide, reported AP.Both suspects were taken to San Bernardino County juvenile hall on suspicion of burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary.The announcement follows a separate case under investigation in Los Angeles County, where thieves stole roughly $7000 worth of the toothy figurines from a store in La Puente.Created by a Hong Kong-born artist, Kasing Lung, the Labubu was first launched in 2015 and is marketed by China’s Pop Mart. More than 300 Labubu doll designs have been released since its debut in 2015.","The theft involved two suspects, both minors, who were later identified as employees of the warehouse.

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a strong lead in the race, according to a recent Siena poll of registered voters.Mamdani is leading the poll at 44 per cent, while former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, trails at 25 per cent. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 12 per cent and current Mayor Eric Adams is at 7 per cent.Siena pollster Steven Greenberg in a press release on Tuesday said that 53 per cent of City Democrats support Mamdani compared to 32 per cent for Cuomo, with the other candidates receiving single-digit support. Among City Republicans, over two-thirds back Sliwa. Independent voters in the city are divided, with 30 per cent supporting Mamdani and 20 per cent supporting Adams.""City voters under 35 are overwhelmingly supporting Mamdani, as are a plurality of voters 35-54, however, voters 55 and older back Cuomo over Mamdani, 38-32 per cent,"" Greenberg added.Mamdani, appearing in the Siena poll for the first time, has a 46 per cent favorability rating among New York City voters but a lower 28 per cent favorability statewide, as reported by Fox News.Cuomo, who resigned as governor and lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani is facing serious favorability issues.""Cuomo has an underwater favorability rating with City voters, 37-54 per cent, and an even worse 29-61 per cent favorability rating with statewide voters, the worst ever favorability rating for Cuomo in a Siena poll. In fact, among Democrats statewide, Cuomo’s favorability rating is 36-56 per cent, down from 51-39 per cent in March,"" he said.Mayor Eric Adams, now running as an independent, also struggles with favorability. Last year, the department of justice charged him with bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance crimes, but the case was dropped later. Adams is showing himself as a strong supporter of law enforcement, especially after the office shooting at 345 Park Avenue last month.However, his ratings remained underwater in the city (30 per cent favorable, 58 per cent unfavorable) and statewide (22 per cent favorable, 51 per cent unfavorable).Republican Curtis Sliwa has a 26 per cent favorable rating statewide and 30 per cent favorable in the city.The recent poll is drawing a lot of attention because Mamdani’s win was a surprise against Cuomo. As the Democratic nominee, Mamdani supports several far-left ideas. He is currently touring the city campaigning against President Donald Trump ""There is no borough that will be free from Trump's cruelty,"" Mamdani said. ""We will feel the pain of this legislation, whether we are in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens or Staten Island, and we will shine a light this week and every week on the costs of this vision that is coming out of Washington, DC""Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa have criticized Mamdani on issues such as policing and rent control. Cuomo even proposed ""Zohran's Law"" after it was revealed that Mamdani lives in a rent-stabilized apartment.The mayoral election will take place on November 4 this year.","Mamdani is leading the poll at 44 per cent, while former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, trails at 25 per cent.

Zelensky Admits 'Difficult Situation' As Russian Military Rips Through Donetsk Region Of Ukraine





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been excluded from the upcoming peace talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, as the meeting was arranged solely at Putin’s request.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that the purpose of this meeting is for President Trump to better understand how to bring an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine, as reported by Fox News.""The president is agreeing to this meeting, at the request of President Putin,"" Leavitt said.

In a statement on Saturday, he said, “""Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine — they are simultaneously decisions against peace.These are dead decisions; they will never work. And what we all need is a real, living peace, one that people will respect.""European allies have also expressed their support for Ukraine.

He stated, ""If it’s a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the Nato leaders and also to President Zelenskyy. I may say, ‘lots of luck, keep fighting,’ or I may say we can make a deal.”When asked if the meeting would lead to a peace agreement or simply help gauge if a deal is possible, Leavitt said both outcomes are possible. She explained, “The president has always said he wants a peace deal. He wants to see this war come to an end. But this bilateral meeting is a bilateral meeting between one party in this two party war.”She added that both countries need to agree for a deal to happen. Trump is accepting the bilateral meeting with Putin on Friday and will share his thoughts on the meeting after it concludes.Confirming the meeting between both leaders, White House Press Secretary added that President Trump is looking forward to host Russian president.""There were many sites discussed, but of course, Alaska is a state within the United States of America,"" Leavitt said.

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that Hamas was unlikely to release the hostages without a change in circumstances, but declined fully to endorse Israel’s plan to attack and occupy Gaza City.He maintained that securing the hostages was always going to be “very rough to get them,” stressing that Hamas “are not going to let the hostages out in the current situation,” Trump was quoted as saying by Axios.Trump said it was up to Israel to decide its next steps and determine whether Hamas should remain in Gaza, but added that, in his view, “they can’t stay there.""""I have one thing to say: remember October 7, remember October 7,"" he said, referring to Hamas’s October 7 attack, reported Axios.

The group had left Qatar for Turkey two weeks before the talks broke down, reported Axios.Netanyahu will now only seek a deal with Hamas that secures the release of all remaining hostages.“The prime minister would be willing to hold negotiations [for a deal] under conditions that we set for ending the war, and only if all the hostages were to be returned. Until then, we will not participate whatsoever in negotiations,” an unknown source was quoted as saying by Channel 12.A new military plan by the Israeli security cabinet has been approved for the complete takeover of Gaza City. “We are not going to occupy Gaza, we are going to free Gaza from Hamas,"" Netanyahu said through a post on X.","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that Hamas was unlikely to release the hostages without a change in circumstances.

The Philippine coast guard released video footage showing the collision, which occurred during a humanitarian mission to aid Filipino fishermen, reported news agency AFP.Commodore Jay Tarriela, spokesperson for the Philippine coast guard, said, ""the (China coast guard vessel) CCG 3104, which was chasing the (Filipino coast guard vessel) BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the (Philippine) vessel's starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA (people's liberation army) Navy warship,"" as quoted by AFP.He added that the Chinese coast guard vessel suffered ""substantial damage"" to its forecastle, rendering it unseaworthy.The BRP Suluan, which was escorting boats distributing aid, had earlier evaded a water cannon attack by the Chinese, Tarriela said. He also noted that the Chinese crew “never responded” to the Filipino ship’s offer of assistance after the collision.Chinese coast guard spokesperson Gan Yu confirmed the confrontation but did not mention the collision.“The China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive them away,” he said in a statement.Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, reacting to the incident, said patrol vessels would “continue to be present” in the area to defend and assert Manila’s sovereign rights.The Scarborough Shoal, a disputed chain of reefs and rocks, has been a recurring flashpoint since China seized control in 2012.

20 arrests after DC police takeover







As Donald Trump took over the control of Washington DC's police in an attempt to curb what the administration said a steep rise in violence, police chief Pamela Smith came under fire as a particular video of her started doing the rounds Tuesday. The police chief was asked about the new chain of command implying who heads what now. To this, Smith asked for clarity on the question-- drawing flak from MAGA commentators who pilloried on her calling her a DEI hire.Attorney General Pam Bondi has been appointed as the interim commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, and Terry Cole is the interim federal administrator.Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police chief Pamela Smith were apparently blindsided by the presidential takeover of the DC police force but they said they are ready to work under federal takeover.""The executive order is pretty clear and so is the law,"" Bowser said. ""The president has the authority by virtue of the statute to request services. Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.""""I answer to Mayor Muriel Bowser, and let me just say this: let us not have any controversy with that, OK, because I know people want to build upon and create division,"" Smith said.""We're here to work together with our federal partners, and that's what we're going to do.""More than 20 people were arrested in Washington, DC, yesterday following the deployment of hundreds of officers and agents after President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.“Approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city.

'Cold civil war': Former NBC host Chuck Todd issues stern warning for America; blames Donald Trump as key driver of political crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cold-civil-war-former-nbc-host-chuck-todd-issues-stern-warning-for-america-blames-donald-trump-as-key-driver-of-political-crisis/articleshow/123263051.cms,"Chuck Todd (Image: X/@chucktodd) and Donald Trump (AP image)





Former NBC host Chuck Todd warned that the United States is heading towards a “cold civil war,” as political battles over redistricting intensify in states like Texas and California.Speaking on The Chuck Toddcast on Tuesday, Todd described the disputes as “the latest skirmish” in an escalating conflict that threatens the country’s constitutional system. He accused US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party of creating “an unprecedented challenge to our constitutional republic.”Todd believes the country is in the middle of a redistricting battle between states. He argued that governors like Greg Abbott in Texas and Gavin Newsom in California are forcing their political agendas without considering the rights of minorities, as reported by Fox News.""I hate using that rhetoric. I hate using those words, but what else are you going to describe it? We are literally having a redistricting war between the states right now, and we have governors who have decided they don't care about the minority rights in their own states,"" Todd argued. ""Greg Abbott doesn't care. If you don't agree with Greg Abbott, he is going to force his will upon you in the state of Texas. And if you don't agree with Gavin Newsom and how they're going — he's going to force his will upon you.The former NBC host said this is not what the nation’s founders intended, blaming both political parties but identifying Trump as the main driver of what he calls a “cold civil war.”Todd claimed Trump has spent much of his presidency “bending and breaking the guardrails of the republic.” While acknowledging that Republicans have pushed aggressive redistricting plans, he warned that Democrats are now willing to break their own long-standing principles, such as support for independent commissions to counter them. He had also criticized Democrats for adopting a “fight fire with fire” approach.""The Democratic response is pretty troubling because, right now as a party, okay, as an official party apparatus, they've decided to frame this moment as a war, right? Okay, you got to fight fire with fire. This is an unprecedented moment, so they're framing this as a war,"" he stated. ""And when you tell yourself you're in a war, you start rationalizing things you'd normally not do that you would say is immoral or wrong or unprincipled. But hey, it's war and all is fair in war, right?""The former NBC anchor also criticized congressional Republicans for failing to check Trump’s power. “""They've not lifted one finger of oversight. Not one… You couldn't even say there've been a weak check on Trump. It has been no check on him at all...Guess what? The Constitution can't enforce itself without people willing to wield those checks. All we have are words on yellowing parchment paper,” he argued.","Former NBC host Chuck Todd warned that the United States is heading towards a “cold civil war,” as political battles over redistricting intensify in states like Texas and California.

Jimmy Kimmel Plans Italian Escape After Trump Says He’ll Be ‘Canceled Next’





American television host and comedian Jimmy Kimmel has revealed that he recently obtained Italian citizenship and is considering moving to Europe because he is scared of President Donald Trump , as reported by New York Post.Speaking on The Sarah Silverman Podcast, the 57-year-old late-night host said he is seriously thinking about leaving the US. “I do have … I did get Italian citizenship. I do have that,” Kimmel said.Silverman noted that several outspoken Trump critics have already left the country. “What’s going on is … as bad as you thought it was gonna be, it’s so much worse. It’s just unbelievable. I feel like it’s probably even worse than [Trump] would like it to be,” Kimmel responded.Kimmel also addressed those who once supported Trump but have since changed their stance, using podcaster Joe Rogan as an example. Rogan, who previously backed Trump, recently criticized the president’s deportation policies. While some reacted by telling Rogan he had no right to complain, Kimmel disagreed. He said people who change their minds or admit they were wrong should be welcomed, as doing so is difficult and rare.“There are a lot of people … now you see these clips of Joe Rogan saying, ‘Why’s he doing this? He shouldn’t be deporting people.’ People go, ‘F–k you, you supported him.’ I don’t buy into that. I don’t believe ‘F–k you, you supported him,'” he said.His remarks came shortly after Trump claimed that Kimmel and fellow host Jimmy Fallon could be the next to lose their jobs, following the reported cancellation of Stephen Colbert ’s Late Show.Speaking about late-night television, Trump criticized the hosts, saying: “Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They’re next. They’re going to be going. I hear they’re going to be going. I don’t know, but I would imagine because they’d get — you know, Colbert has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon.”",Kimmel said he recently obtained Italian citizenship and is considering moving to Europe.

"'No one ever had sex on the moon': Nasa intern stole $21m of lunar samples in 2002, put them under blanket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-one-ever-had-sex-on-the-moon-nasa-intern-stole-21m-of-lunar-samples-in-2002-put-them-under-blanket/articleshow/123261246.cms,"Thad Roberts served in jail for stealing lunar samples from Nasa out of his love for girlfriend.





48-year-old Thad Roberts is still being remembered for his daring and one-of-a-kind heist as he stole lunar samples from Nasa where he was interning in 2002. Roberts was 24 years old at that time, and he gave his girlfriend 'sex on the moon' for which he was sentenced to eight years in prison.Roberts, his girlfriend Tiffany, who was also a Nasa intern and a third intern hatched the plan to steal samples of moon rocks and a meteorite. Roberts even connected online with a potential buyer from Belgium who was willing to pay $1,000 to $5,000 per gram of lunar samples. The buyer alerted the FBI at that time but Roberts did not sell those to him.Roberts first had sex on the moon with his girlfriend as he said, without her knowledge, he put the lunar samples underneath the blanket on the bed. ""I never said anything, but I'm sure she could feel it,"" Roberts told CBS News in 2012.“It was more about the symbol of what we were doing, basically having sex on the moon. It’s more uncomfortable than not, but it wasn’t about the comfort at that point. It was about the expression. And no one had ever had sex on the moon before. I think we can safely say that.”Then Roberts went to the potential buyer; by that time, FBI agents had tracked them, and they were arrested.The samples were ""useless to the scientific community,"" but the heist of the moon samples destroyed three decades of handwritten research notes by a scientist.Roberts told the police that he did not see it as stealing, as they were not going to get huge money to buy a yacht or a big house or a car. He said he and the other two interns who helped him were struggling at that time.“I was in love with Tiffany,” Roberts told the LA Times in 2004. “In my mind, I was thinking, ‘Baby, I’d give you the moon.’ It would be a romantic start to our relationship.”""I mean, the simple answer is to say that I did it for love. I did it because I wanted to be loved. I wanted someone to know that I'd literally cared about them that much. And to have the symbol there to remind them of it.""","Thad Roberts, 48, stole lunar samples from Nasa where he was interning in 2002.
