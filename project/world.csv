NEW DELHI: At least 15 people were killed and several others were injured after a stampede at New Delhi Railway Station late Saturday night. The incident occurred as a massive crowd gathered after the announcement of a special train, leading to chaos within 15-20 minutes.Among the 15 casualties in the incident, three were children, according to the chief casualty medical officer of LNJP Hospital.The situation unfolded due to a huge rush of passengers who had reached the station to board special trains for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj. Some passengers fainted amid the sudden surge, sparking rumours of a stampede-like situation and further fuelling panic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X and said he was ""distressed"" by the stampede.

The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede,"" PM Modi said.Following the incident, a call was made to the Delhi Fire Service, prompting the deployment of four fire tenders to the scene. Injured and fainted passengers were promptly taken to nearby hospitals by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Delhi Police.The situation has since been brought under control, according to DCP Railway KPS Malhotra, who explained that the crowd surge was triggered by the delay of two trains and an unexpected influx of passengers.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced a high-level investigation into the incident and confirmed that four special trains were arranged to manage the unprecedented rush, with more on standby. In a tweet, he stated, “4 special trains to evacuate this unprecedented sudden rush at NDLS.

TALIT (BURDWAN): Diversity is intrinsic to India's existence and reflected in its culture of embracing pluralism, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said at an event in Bengal's Burdwan on Sunday.""Indian civilisation is ancient. Every community has its character. Hindus know it and accept that. They know that our pluralist character is a manifestation of unity,"" he said during the rally in Talit, calling for ""sanhati"" (unity) of all Hindus.""We should respect the separate characteristic traits of different communities. Diversity of language and culture has always been part of the Indian ethos. This culture created our identity as Hindus. 'Hindu' is not people from a particular community or religion. Hindus believe in ' vasudhaiva kutumbakam ' (the world is one family). We have always believed in harmony, even with our enemies.""Alluding to Pakistan, the RSS chief said ""those who felt they couldn't remain within this harmonious society made their own country"" while ""those who didn't leave the country accepted the nature of Indian society"".Bhagwat reminded RSS swayamsevaks of "" rajdharma "", citing Ram as the epitome of this ideal. ""India remembers the king who decided to spend 14 years in the wilderness just to keep his father's word. It also remembers the king who put the exiled king's shoes on the throne and ruled the country.""He expressed happiness at RSS expanding its network in Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis defended the state government’s decision to form a committee to examine legal options against "" love jihad "". He said that while interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.“The Supreme Court has also acknowledged the reality of love jihad in its decision. Even in Maharashtra, we are seeing an increase in such cases. It is not wrong for a person of one religion to marry a person of another religion. But marrying someone by lying and showing false identity is wrong. These incidents are very serious, and action must be taken,” Fadnavis said, as reported by news agency ANI.The Maharashtra government has established a seven-member panel to explore legal provisions on forced conversions . Led by the state’s Director General of Police (DGP), the committee includes senior officials from departments such as law and judiciary, women and child development, minority affairs, social justice, special assistance, and home affairs. The panel will study similar laws in other states and recommend measures to tackle reported cases.BJP leaders, including Union minister Ramdas Athawale, have welcomed the move, calling for stricter laws to prevent religious conversions through coercion. “There should be a law against love jihad. The conversion of women is not right. Two youngsters of different religions coming together is normal, but girls shouldn’t be forcefully converted,” Athawale said.Maharashtra minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha also expressed support, claiming that the number of such cases has risen, particularly in Mumbai. He said that when he raised the issue in the Vidhan Sabha, Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh opposed it and even filed a court case against him. “Does he want to encourage love jihad?” Lodha questioned. He added that many cases go unreported and thanked Fadnavis for setting up the committee.The government resolution (GR) setting up the committee specifically mentioned 'love jihad' and outlined the panel’s responsibilities, which include examining other states' laws, handling complaints, and developing legal frameworks, TOI had earlier reported. The document noted that the decision was based on requests from public representatives, organisations, and citizens seeking action against forced conversions.Fadnavis had previously indicated plans for such a law when he was deputy chief minister in 2023. He had stated that growing concerns over religious conversions through marriage had prompted demands for legal measures.“Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken,” he had said at the time.","Devendra Fadnavis: Interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States. Tharoor acknowledged key achievements from PM Modi ’s visit, particularly on trade negotiations and defence cooperation. He welcomed the trade deal discussions and expressed optimism over India’s diplomatic engagements.However, his remarks prompted a clarification from the Congress party , which said that individual opinions do not reflect the party’s official stance.He stressed that when someone in the government does the right thing, it should be recognised, irrespective of who's in power.“For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it.”“If I were to praise all the time, no one would take me seriously. If I were to criticise all the time, no one would take me seriously either… There’s got to be some give and take in democracy,” the Congress MP said.Tharoor also welcomed the progress on trade talks between India and the US, saying that an agreement had been reached to conduct negotiations over the next nine months. “It’s far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian,” he said.On illegal immigration, he questioned whether Modi had raised concerns over the treatment of Indian nationals deported from the US. “There are some questions that still remain… Why did the question of the way in which those illegal immigrants were returned to India not get addressed? Did PM Modi raise it behind closed doors?”He further elaborated, “The only thing missing from what Prime Minister Modi said was the question of the manner in which those people were treated and sent back. I think otherwise his stand was absolutely correct. These are misled youth who have been encouraged or induced to migrate illegally, and they should be taken back. If they are Indian citizens, they belong in our country, we take them back. But I hope that something was said behind closed doors, not perhaps in the press conference, but inside privately, that this manner of doing it—the handcuffs, the insults, the mistreatment, the military aircraft—all that should be avoided in future.”On Trump calling PM Modi a better negotiator than himself, the Congress MP called it an ""astonishing"" acknowledgment. He noted that Trump, known for branding himself as a master dealmaker, rarely compliments others, especially in areas he considers his expertise.""I think calling Mr. Modi a better negotiator than himself is astonishing because Mr. Trump takes pride in being this sort of art of the deal that is his strength. And his admirers, including yesterday the defense secretary of the US, had said that Mr. Trump is the greatest negotiator in the world.""""And here Mr. Trump says Mr. Modi is better than him. So I think we are looking at a very high degree of praise from a man who is not known for saying praiseworthy things. So this is good news,"" Tharoor said.Following Tharoor’s comments, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took to social media to clarify the party’s position without directly naming Tharoor. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Indian National Congress is our country’s ONLY political party where there is absolute freedom of speech as well as freedom after speech. Members give their views on issues which are, on occasion, their own and do not reflect the opinion of the party as a collective entity. It is the party’s stance that is paramount.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States.

Two European Union officials confirmed the development to Politico.""I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris,"" Sikorski said, emphasising that the discussions will address Trump’s recent moves ""in a very serious fashion.""Sikorski also compared Trump's approach to foreign policy to a Russian military strategy known as razvedka boyem—or ""reconnaissance through battle""—where a leader pushes boundaries to test reactions before adjusting positions. ""You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position. And we need to respond,"" he added.Trump's impact on Nato and European security has been a recurring concern among EU leaders. While Sikorski has previously acknowledged Trump's calls for European nations to increase their defence spending , he has also been vocal about the broader risks the US president poses to global stability .Macron, however, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump. Following Trump's re-election in November, the French leader expressed a willingness to collaborate with him again. ""Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity,"" Macron posted on X.Trump's December visit to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral further underscored Macron’s diplomatic approach. ""It's a great honour for the French people to welcome you five years later,"" Macron told Trump during the visit, recalling his past support in the wake of the cathedral fire.","French President Emmanuel Macron has convened an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss the implications of US President Donald Trump's actions.

"Sinking Bangladeshi vessel dumps toxic fly ash in river near Ghoramara, shows video shared by panchayat member",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sinking-bangladeshi-vessel-dumps-toxic-fly-ash-in-river-near-ghoramara-shows-video-shared-by-panchayat-member/articleshow/118317190.cms,"‘Marginal fishermen may suffer the most’

KOLKATA: A video shared by a panchayat member from Ghoramara island on Sunday shows a sinking Bangladeshi vessel illegally dumping toxic fly ash into the Muriganga river , raising serious environmental concerns.According to reports, the vessel, MV Sea World, was en route to Bangladesh from Budge Budge when it struck a sandbar near Ghoramara, causing a fracture in its hull. Over the past 72 hours, the damage worsened, with nearly 70% of the vessel compromised. Officials initially instructed that the ship be towed back to Bangladesh before the fly ash could mix with the water, but no significant action was taken by the Bangladeshi shipping agency.Instead, locals and fishermen alleged that the vessel’s crew, under the cover of darkness and isolation, deliberately discharged fly ash into the river — using machines — to dilute the toxic material with water and release it into the aquatic ecosystem. “A second vessel and two boats arrived at the scene, accelerating the unloading process to lighten the damaged ship and tow it away,” said Sanjib Sagar, Ghoramara panchayat upa-pradhan.Experts warned that fly ash contains heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium and lead, which can contaminate river water, disrupt aquatic life, and enter the human food chain through fish consumption. “Fly ash leaching into the river can alter water chemistry, increase toxicity, and pose severe health risks,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director, School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.He further warned that this contamination could impact groundwater, soil quality, and biodiversity, with long-term ecological consequences.The minister for Sundarbans affairs, Bankim Hazra, said: “I will visit the site tomorrow to investigate the situation. I went there on the first day after the incident occurred. The additional SP and BDO were also present. Twelve crew members of the sinking Bangladeshi vessel had been rescued after it hit the sandbar. If fly ash is indeed being dumped into the river, it is extremely dangerous.”Local fishermen, who depend on Muriganga’s rich fish population, fear a devastating impact. Bijon Maity, secretary of the Fishermen’s Association in Kakdwip, expressed grave concerns: “If the experts confirm that heavy metals are contaminating the water, marginal fishermen will suffer the most. This region is a prime fishing zone for high-value species like topse, bhola, bhetki, prawns and farsa. The affected area supports thousands of small-scale fishermen from Sagar, Ghoramara, Kakdwip, Haldia, Nandigram and Khejuri.”Ghoramara panchayat head Ambiya Khatun Bibi also acknowledged receiving similar complaints from local fishermen. This is not the first such incident in the region. Experts and environmentalists stress the need for strict monitoring, regulatory protocols, and enforcement to prevent further contamination. There are also calls for stringent action against the Bangladeshi shipping agency responsible for the vessel.Authorities have been urged to conduct immediate water testing and implement a proper safety framework to protect the river ecosystem, groundwater, and public health from toxic exposure.","A video shows a sinking Bangladeshi vessel illegally dumping toxic fly ash into the Muriganga river.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio Sunday fully endorsed Israel's war aims in the Gaza Strip, saying Hamas ""must be eradicated"" and throwing the future of the shaky ceasefire into further doubt.Rubio met with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour, where he is likely to face pushback from Arab leaders over President Trump's proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it under US ownership. Netanyahu has welcomed the plan, and said he and Trump have a ""common strategy"" for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, he said ""the gates of hell would be open"" if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Their remarks came just two weeks before the first phase of the ceasefire is set to end. Rubio said Hamas ""cannot continue as a military or government force.""The Israeli military meanwhile said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run interior ministry said the strike killed three cops while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah.","Rubio met with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour.

Cold grips northern US

Tornado in the South

At least nine people have lost their lives as severe weather continues to wreak havoc across the United States. Kentucky has been the hardest hit, with eight fatalities as rising waters swept away cars and homes.US President Donald Trump approved a disaster declaration for Kentucky, allowing federal aid to assist with relief efforts.Governor Andy Beshear confirmed on Sunday that hundreds of people had to be rescued after heavy rainfall caused creeks to overflow, submerging roads and homes.A mother and her seven-year-old child were among those who drowned after their car was caught in floodwaters in Hart County. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in Clay County. In total, four people lost their lives in Hart County alone.The flooding forced the Kentucky River Medical Center in Jackson to close its emergency department and transfer all patients to other hospitals. Authorities posted images on social media showing homes and vehicles completely submerged, while mudslides blocked roads in Virginia and other areas.Beshear reported that over 1,000 rescues had been carried out since the storms began on Saturday. Nearly 39,000 homes lost power, and strong winds threatened to cause further outages.While the South deals with severe flooding, the Northern Plains are facing dangerously low temperatures. An Arctic blast is sending wind chills plunging as low as -50°F (-45.6°C) across North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.The national weather service warned of “life-threatening cold” with temperatures expected to drop to -30°F (-34°C) or lower on Monday and Tuesday.The storm system has also made travel difficult. Michigan saw 114 crashes in the Detroit area on Sunday caused by drivers going too fast on icy roads.Avalanche warnings have been issued across the Rocky Mountains, stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with Utah facing the highest risk.Meteorologists say this is the 10th polar vortex event of the season, with Arctic winds forcing frigid air down from the North Pole into the US and Europe. Authorities are urging people to stay off the roads and take precautions to stay safe.In Alabama, an EF-1 tornado struck Hale County overnight, damaging mobile homes, toppling trees, and bringing down power lines. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, a levee in the small town of Rives failed on Saturday afternoon, sending floodwaters rushing into nearby neighbourhoods. A levee is a man-made embankment built along rivers or lakes to prevent flooding.Officials rushed to evacuate residents, while a flash flood warning had been issued for the area just hours before the levee collapsed.In Atlanta, a person was killed when a massive tree crashed onto a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta fire rescue captain Scott Powell.","Kentucky has been the hardest hit, with eight fatalities as rising waters swept away cars and homes.

JD Vance’s Greta joke falls flat at Munich Security Conference,"" another user wroteVance, during his speech, launched a scathing critique of European policies, asserting that the greatest threat to democracy in Europe comes from within rather than external adversaries like Russia or China.“There is a new sheriff in town under Donald Trump’s leadership,” Vance declared, reinforcing the administration’s hardline stance on issues such as border security and ideological battles over free speech. Vance’s speech came amid heightened tensions between the United States and European allies over defence spending, trade, and governance.He criticised European leaders for allegedly suppressing dissenting voices, saying, “We may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square. Agree or disagree.”Specifically targeting Germany, which faces elections on February 23, Vance urged European countries to “change course” on immigration. He linked his concerns to a recent attack in Munich, where a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker allegedly rammed a car into a crowd, injuring 36 people.“How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilisation in a new direction?” Vance questioned. “An asylum seeker, often a young man in his mid-20s already known to police, rams a car into a crowd and shatters a community.”Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump reacted to Vance's criticism of longstanding US partners.He said that he listened to Vance's remarks. “He talked about freedom of speech. And I think it's true in Europe,” Trump stated. “They're losing their wonderful right of freedom of speech.”The President even claimed that Europe suffers from a “big immigration problem.”",US vice president JD Vance drew flak after he compared Elon Musk with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.

Some staff discovered they were fired only when they found themselves locked out of their offices on Friday morning. One of the hardest-hit sites was the Pantex Plant in Texas, which handles the assembly and disassembly of nuclear warheads. Around 30% of the employees dismissed from NNSA were from Pantex, a facility requiring the highest levels of security clearance.The layoffs were part of a broader Department of Energy (DOE) staff purge, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative associated with Elon Musk . Around 2,000 DOE employees were targeted in the cuts. “The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “They don’t seem to realise that it’s actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.”By Friday night, the acting NNSA director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo reinstating all but 28 of the fired workers. “This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025, has been rescinded, effective immediately,” read the memo, obtained by the Associated Press. However, some employees could not be reached after being let go, and others were reconsidering their return due to the uncertainty created by DOGE’s handling of the situation.The DOE first said fewer than 50 NNSA employees were fired, calling them “probationary” staff in administrative roles. However, reports showed many of them had key jobs in nuclear weapons maintenance, waste management, and site security. The affected sites include the Savannah River National Laboratory in South Carolina, the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington—where 177 waste tanks store radioactive material—and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, once a key Manhattan Project site.US Representative Marcy Kaptur and Senator Patty Murray criticised the layoffs as “utterly callous and dangerous.” Experts fear such disruptions could weaken US nuclear security and embolden adversaries. “This is a pivotal moment,” said NNSA deputy division director Rob Plonski. “Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.”","Up to 350 employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) lost their jobs.

The focus shifted to nine known living captives yet to be freed under the current phase.On Saturday, Trump posted on TruthSocial that Israel must decide its response to the missed deadline for releasing all hostages, affirming US support for Israel's decision.Netanyahu, speaking with Rubio, reaffirmed Israel's objectives: defeating Hamas, recovering all hostages, and ensuring Gaza poses no future threat to Israel.

Trump’s 'saving the country' claim sparks social media meltdown: 'Wannabe dictator',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-saving-the-country-claim-sparks-social-media-meltdown-wannabe-dictator/articleshow/118301034.cms,"Donald Trump has once again ignited a firestorm with a single social media post. Taking to his various social media platforms, Trump declared, ""He who saves his Country does not violate any Law."" The post, which was quickly pinned to the top of his profile, immediately triggered a social media meltdown, with critics branding it the rhetoric of a ""wannabe dictator.""Trump’s statement came amid growing scrutiny over his sweeping executive actions since returning to office, which have reshaped federal agencies, social policies, and international relations. Critics argue that his administration’s mass federal firings, tariff escalations, and legal battles have pushed the limits of executive power. The White House amplified his message by sharing the statement on X.Social media erupted in response, with many seeing the post as a troubling sign of Trump's intentions. “Nothing screams more AUTOCRATIC DICTATOR than ‘He who saves his country does not violate any law,’” one user posted. Another wrote, “Trump just dropped a line straight out of the dictator playbook. That’s Napoleonic-level delusion. Translation? Laws don’t apply to him if he decides he’s ‘saving’ America.”Others warned that the message sought to normalise unchecked power. “If you accept that premise, you’ll stop fighting him, and then he WILL be able to do whatever he wants. Don’t take the bait.”“Imagine Luigi’s lawyer using this tweet as part of his defense,” one person wrote, referring to Luigi Nicholas Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The reference stemmed from Trump’s message seemingly aligning with justifications often used in extreme cases. Another user sarcastically noted, “Donald Trump just said Luigi did nothing wrong.”The debate over Trump's post also extended to constitutional concerns. Critics pointed out that the presidential oath binds the leader to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" not to override laws in the name of national salvation.Meanwhile, Trump’s foreign policy moves have also sparked global unease. His recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to initiate peace talks over Ukraine led to criticism from European leaders, particularly after Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested NATO membership for Ukraine was “not in the cards.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed scepticism, insisting that any peace deal must involve security guarantees for his country.Despite the backlash, Trump's allies have defended his approach. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the administration’s rapid-fire executive actions as “legitimate,” and praised efforts to reshape the federal government. However, some Republican lawmakers have voiced quiet concerns, particularly over Trump’s aggressive deportation policies and sweeping agency cuts.","Donald Trump sparked a firestorm with a single social media post.

Alabama Power: Residents in Alabama left without water after drilling hits aquifer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/residents-in-alabama-left-without-water-after-drilling-hits-aquifer/articleshow/118301170.cms,"Residents in Alabama left without water after drilling hits aquifer

Wells running dry

Shelby County residents blame Alabama Power drilling for dry wells

Uncertain future for the Aquifer

A community in Vandiver, Alabama, is facing a major water crisis after an underground drilling project damaged an aquifer supplying private wells.As reported by AL.com, the issue began when Alabama Power hired a drilling company, REM directional , to install fibre optic cables in Coosa Mountain, located in northern Shelby County.During drilling, the aquifer was struck, causing water to gush from the site. Since then, several residents have been left without a water supply.“They’re not sure it can be fixed, and that’s what scares us all,” said Tommy Fish, one of the affected residents.According to CBS 42, the first signs of trouble appeared in January when residents noticed their wells running dry. Peter Adkins, another resident, consulted a plumber but found no internal plumbing issues. He later visited the drilling site and was informed by a worker that they had observed an unusual amount of water flowing back during the process.Currently, eight wells belonging to five homeowners are completely dry, while others are experiencing a significant drop in water levels. Many residents rely entirely on private wells as they are too far from municipal water connections.Last week, a lawsuit was filed by three residents, including Fish, to halt the drilling. Shelby County Circuit court judge Patrick Kennedy initially issued a temporary restraining order.However, as per AL.com, the judge later ruled that drilling must continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to complete the project as quickly as possible.The court also instructed Alabama Power to provide daily status reports and assist affected residents by supplying water and other necessities.Fish and other residents worry about the long-term impact on the aquifer and their homes. “As the water table continues to lower, it will affect more people,” he said.Attorney Bruce Romeo, representing the affected homeowners, told WVTM 13 that there is no guarantee the aquifer can be restored. He also raised concerns that the depletion of the aquifer could lead to ground instability, which might affect housing structures.“Losing the aquifer could destabilise the ground, which could in turn jeopardise people’s homes,” Fish warned.Alabama Power stated that completing the project swiftly is the best course of action to assess and resolve the issue. “Upon completion, we can fully assess any impacted wells and promptly resolve the matter,” said spokesperson Alyson Tucker.With another court hearing scheduled for 18 February, residents remain anxious about the future of their water supply.","Alabama Power hired a drilling company to install fibre optic cables in Coosa Mountain, located in northern Shelby County.

This was an extremely vile act. The electricity in my cell was shut off for five days, leaving me in complete darkness. I was confined to the cell for ten days. For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years. A 12-member parliamentary committee will nominate the new chief justice of Pakistan from a panel of the three most senior judges, ARY News reported.As per the report, the committee, comprising eight members from the National Assembly and four from the Senate, will propose the name to the Prime Minister, who will then forward it to the President for final approval.A Judicial Commission of Pakistan, led by chief justice and including three senior judges, two members each from the National Assembly and Senate, Pakistan's federal minister for law and justice, the attorney general, and a nominee of the Pakistan Bar Council, having not less than 15 years of practice in the Supreme Court, will be responsible for appointments of the judges of the Supreme Court.",Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) founder Imran Khan has ordered the expulsion of party members who were not present during the vote on the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
