Professional setback

NEW DELHI: The massive uproar over content creator Ranveer Allahbadia 's ""sex and parents"" remark at comedian Samay Raina 's "" India's Got Latent "" show only intensified on Tuesday, with people across the spectrum stepping in to condemn Allahbadia's crass comment.Allahbadia, widely popular for his YouTube channel ""BeerBiceps,"" landed trouble after a clip of him from Samay Raina's show went viral. What began as backlash from netizens quickly escalated into a national debate, drawing criticism from political leaders, a body for women's rights and other public figures.Hours after facing criticism on social media on Monday, Allahbadia issued an apology but the matter did not subside. Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske on Tuesday raised the matter in Parliament during Zero Hour, calling for a law to regulate social media. He said there was a need to enact a law to regulate social media platforms where influencers are posting ""all kinds of nonsense"" in the name of freedom of speech .""The inappropriate things they said yesterday should be censored. There should be censorship on influencers' content, and today I also raised this issue in Parliament, suggesting that action should be taken against them. If such individuals continue to spread negativity, action should be taken against them,"" Mhaske told news agency PTI.The NCW also urged information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to take immediate regulatory measures to address the prevalence of obscene content on various over-the-top (OTT) platforms and social media streaming sites.The Maharashtra Cyber Department registered the case under relevant sections of the IT Act, BNS and sought the removal of all 18 episodes of Raina's comedy show. A team of Mumbai Police was also spotted outside Allahbadia's residence on Tuesday.The Assam Police also registered an FIR against five people, including podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia and comedian Samay Raina.Allahbadia is already facing police complaints in Guwahati and Indore. Summonses are being sent to about 30 guests who have participated in the show from the first episode till now, a police official said.The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Tuesday expressed strong concern and asked Allahbadia, Samay Raina, Apoorva Makhija, Jaspreet Singh, and Ashish Chanchlani, as well as the show's producers Tushar Poojari and Saurabh Bothra to appear before it on February 17 in New Delhi.The summons came after women and child development minister Annapurna Devi said her ministry will seek a report from the NCW in this regard.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, a member of the parliamentary committee on Communications and Information Technology, said she will raise the issue for the kind of ""vulgar, blasphemous content that is passed off as comedy"".""We need to set boundaries since these platforms influence young minds and they are passing off absolute rubbish as content. The language used by Ranveer Allahbadia, which was also actively encouraged by others on that 'comedy panel', is unacceptable,"" she told news agency PTI.Calling the whole episode sad, BJP leader Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan said: ""The experiment that they have done, they have broken the law. I don't know but if the parliamentary committee has taken a decision, then they will be called"".Women and Child Development Minister Annapurna Devi said her ministry will seek a report from the NCW in this regard.Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali said mistakes by immature should not be taken seriously.""I feel people should do what they enjoy doing. Obscenity is a subject that looks bad and anybody would agree. But people are immature so their mistakes should also not be taken seriously,"" Ali said in an interview.Actor Manoj Bajpayee suggested that one achieving success at a young age should understand the environment.""This is why I say, please read the newspaper,"" Bajpayee added.Veteran actor Raza Murad told PTI: ""Some people say such vulgar things, some people abuse and there is no restriction on them yet. But anyway, better late than never. I would like to say that democracy does not mean spreading vulgarity, our constitution does not allow this.""Mukesh Khanna, who played the popular roles of Bheeshma in Mahabharata and Shaktiman, said Allahbadia's remark was ""vulgar and irresponsible"".""The problem is the youth of today has been given too much liberty in the name of 'freedom of expression'. There needs to be a limit to everything, even freedom of expression... I saw the video. He made a shameful statement, and all of them present around him, they all laughed. Nobody cared to object him,"" Khanna.Allahbadia suffered a setback for his show as singer B Praak called off an appearance on the influencer's podcast.""I was supposed to appear on a podcast, on Beer Biceps, and we cancelled that. Why? Since we are all seeing how pathetic his thinking is... The choice of words that he has used on Samay Raina's show,"" Praak said in an Instagram video.","Ranveer Allahbadia's ""sex and parents"" remark at comedian Samay Raina's show sparks outrage.

3 men dead after drinking ‘jeera soda’ in Gujarat town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-men-dead-after-drinking-jeera-soda-in-gujarat-town/articleshow/118127192.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Three men died after drinking ""jeera soda"" from a bottle in Nadiad town of Kheda late on Sunday evening. Senior police officers have ruled it out to be a case of spurious liquor consumption as no traces of methanol were found in their bodies.Police officials suspect it to be either a case of targeted poisoning or a failed experiment with a new concoction.The victims, Kanu Chauhan, 54, a deaf and speech-impaired man who operated a weighing machine; Ravindra Rathod, 49, a daily wage worker; and Yogesh Kushwaha, 40, a panipuri seller - all resided in the Jawaharnagar area.""The primary report of the forensic science laboratory found the presence of 0.1% ethanol in the bodies.

The cops learned of the deaths around 9pm on Sunday after a medico-legal case was filed at Nadiad Civil Hospital.""We came to know that three people died after having a drink on Sunday evening. As these were initially suspected to be hooch-related deaths, the probe was intensified. An eyewitness told police that he saw Chauhan drinking from a bottle of jeera soda and offering it to others. After the witness declined Chauhan's offer, he gave the bottle to Rathod and Kushwaha. Both the men drank from the bottle,"" Gadhia said. Rathod lost consciousness first, followed by Chauhan and Kushwaha.Gadhia said that Rathod was brought dead to the hospital, whereas the other two died during their treatment.""The cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest . Forensic experts told police that they may have died due to sodium nitrite or potassium cyanide poisoning as evidenced by blood clots in their bodies,"" Gadhia said.Nadiad police are now investigating whether Chauhan was a victim of intentional poisoning or a failed experiment using a new concoction.""Cops have collected 80 empty bottles from a dustbin near the spot where the victims collapsed. These will be sent for forensic tests to check for traces of poison. Once we get the results, the course of further investigation will be decided,"" Gadhia said. Nadiad town police have registered a case of accidental death, pending further forensic analysis.","Kanu Chauhan, 54, a deaf and speech-impaired man who operated a weighing machine; Ravindra Rathod, 49, a daily wage worker; and Yogesh Kushwaha, 40, a panipuri seller - all resided in the Jawaharnagar area.

Elon Musk Social Security: Will Elon Musk access your Social Security number? Here's what he says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-elon-musk-access-your-social-security-number-heres-what-he-says/articleshow/118125572.cms,"Will Elon Musk impact your Social Security benefits?

$100 billion to individuals with no SSN



What will the world's richest man do with your SSN?



Social Security Number is a nine-digit number issued to US citizens, permanent and temporary residents issued by the Social Security Administration to track Social Security benefits . Now that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has some access to the treasury's payment system that handles over $6 trillion in annual federal payments, DOGE can access Social Security details.According to a letter sent by the Treasury Department to Congress, DOGE now has ""read-only"" access, meaning Musk's team shouldn't be able to directly modify or stop payments. However, the concern remains on what his level of access could mean in the long run.""Social Security beneficiaries and their families have every reason to be alarmed by Elon Musk's takeover of the U.S. Department of Treasury's payment system...Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits — or their personal data,"" Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said.White it's not know what access DOGE has and to what extent, Donald Trump asserted that DOGE will not touch Social Security. ""Social Security will not be touched, it will only be strengthened,"" Trump recently said adding that he would ""weed out"" undocumented people from the benefits. “We have illegal immigrants on Social Security and we’re going to find out who they are and take them off… we’re not going to stand for that.”Elon Musk's team claimed to have already found out that the payments department paid $100 billion per year to individuals with no Social Security Number or temporary ID number. ""Yesterday, I was told that there are currently over $100B/year of entitlements payments to individuals with no SSN or even a temporary ID number. If accurate, this is extremely suspicious,"" he said""When I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so USD 50B/year or USD1B/week!!""Several pro-Musk posts on X attempted to allay fears and asked users what they think the world's richest man would do with their SSN. Elon Musk shared those posts amid massive concern over SSN.""Elon Musk couldn’t care about your social security number. He is following fraud and waste payments. He worked at PayPal with 100M users private information and he works at SpaceX that has highly classified information. He has never done anything wrong with this type of info,"" Musk shared this post.""The goal of auditing the Social Security Administration is to stop the extreme levels of fraud taking place, so that it remains solvent and protects the social security checks of honest Americans! That’s it. That’s the goal. End of story,"" Elon Musk added.""And for damn sure, I'm 1000% more trustworthy than until numbers of deep state bureaucrats and fraudsters who may be misusing your SSN right now,"" Elon Musk wrote in another post.",Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has some access to the treasury's payment system that handles over $6 trillion in annual federal payments.

Row over Elon Musk's DOGE



Donald Trump Jr could not wrap his head around the fact that people have a problem with Elon Musk's young staff of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) -- as young as 19 -- who are now scrutinizing the federal departments and looking into the justification for their existence.""One is 19 years old. His job title is Expert. When you were 19, what were you an expert at,"" a social media user posted taking a jibe at Elon Musk's 19-year-old staff Edward Coristine who has been in the national news for his internet identity 'Big Balls'. Reacting to the post, Donald Trump Jr asked why then Greta Thunberg was considered a ""really serious climatologist"".""But Greta Thunberg at 17 was a really serious climatologist. I would stack any one of @elonmusk ’s genius computer scientists against her any day. Why don’t you instead discuss all of the things they’ve uncovered and exposed? Seems you don’t have much of an argument there,"" Don Jr said.Donald Trump and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg had a few acrimonious exchanges during Trump's first term.Elon Musk's DOGE has been dominating the headlines after Musk announced that USAID would be shut down. A few days before the announcement, DOGE staff had a face-off at the USAID office where they sought some access which the office staff initially denied. After Elon Musk's intervention, the approval was given but within a few days, USAID was called useless making it look like the conflict with DOGE staff resulted in this. And insiders revealed that those staff were as young as 19 years old. A detailed account of who all are working in DOGE revealed that only Coristine is 19 years old and is the youngest. There are other members -- some senior as well but the team that is interviewing federal employees and asking them to justify their job apparently comprises young people, college drop-outs.Marko Elez, a 25-year-old staff, resigned after his problematic posts where he acknowledged that he's racist and called for normalizing Indian hate surfaced. But Elon Musk rehired him based on an X poll which was in favor of the decision.","Elon Musk's DOGE has been dominating the headlines after Musk announced that USAID would be shut down.

Poll Do Political Endorsements Influence Public Opinion? No, People Decide Independently Yes, Shape Voter Views

The Marko Elez Controversy: A Test of Allegiance

The Contrast:

Got No Second Chances

Vance’s Political Gamble

JD Vance did everything right.He embraced Trump’s MAGA movement , abandoned his past criticisms, and transformed himself into a loyal foot soldier of the former president’s agenda. He positioned himself as the future of the Republican Party , the next leader of Trumpism after 2028. And when the time came to prove his allegiance, he did not hesitate—not even when it meant standing by a man who openly called for the normalization of hate against people like his own wife and children.Yet, when asked whether Vance was his political successor, Trump refused to commit.“No, but he’s very capable,” Trump said, brushing off the question. “I think you have a lot of very capable people… It’s too early.”For Vance, this should have been a coronation. Instead, it was a cold reminder that no matter how much he sacrifices, Trump's loyalty is never unconditional.The defining moment of Vance’s early vice presidency wasn’t a policy push or a diplomatic victory—it was his handling of the Marko Elez scandal .Elez, a 25-year-old former staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency, posted “Normalize Indian Hate” on social media. The backlash was immediate, and Elez was fired. For a moment, it seemed like accountability had won.Then Elon Musk got involved.The tech billionaire—who has made a habit of decrying “cancel culture” while selectively deciding who gets to be “uncanceled”—held a poll on X, formerly Twitter, asking whether Elez should be reinstated. He was.But the reinstatement wasn’t just a Musk decision. JD Vance supported it. He defended Elez, dismissing the outrage as “emotional blackmail” and telling critics—including Indian Americans who directly appealed to him as a father of Indian American children—to “grow up.”Congressman Ro Khanna asked him the most obvious question:Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘ Normalize Indian Hate ’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.Vance ignored it. Instead, he signaled that racist remarks against Indian Americans simply weren’t a big deal. Elez had made a mistake, he argued, but deserved “grace.”It was the ultimate test of loyalty—choosing his political ambitions over his own family’s dignity. And he passed with flying colors.Vance’s willingness to defend Elez is made even more glaring by the stark contrast in how another MAGA-aligned Indian American, Vivek Ramaswamy, was treated.Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur who became a rising MAGA star, was unceremoniously dumped from his role in the Department of Government Efficiency—not for racism, not for corruption, but for challenging the establishment. No poll. No second chances. Just the door.The same movement that went out of its way to “forgive” Elez had no mercy for Ramaswamy. The message was clear: if you are white and conservative, you get a second chance. If you are Indian and conservative, your usefulness is conditional.Vance should have been the heir apparent to Trump. He had positioned himself as the most loyal, most aggressive defender of Trump’s vision. He embraced every battle, from the culture wars to foreign policy, aligning himself completely with the former president.Yet Trump’s refusal to name him as his successor is telling. It suggests hesitation, doubt. Even after proving his loyalty, even after defending an open racist at great personal cost, Vance still didn’t get the blessing he wanted.Perhaps Trump sees Vance as expendable. Perhaps he knows that loyalty is cheap in MAGA world, and Vance has already proven that he will do whatever is asked of him, even when it means turning his back on his own family’s identity.Or perhaps, despite all his efforts, Vance simply isn’t what Trump envisions for the future of the movement. If that is the case, then he has thrown everything away—including his dignity—for nothing.","The Marko Elez Controversy was a test of JD Vance's loyalty to Donald Trump.

Why Super Bowl Champions visit the White House?



Which president started the tradition of Super Bowl champs visiting the White House?

The Evolution of White House Sports Ceremonies



Sports, Politics, and Controversies



The Philadelphia Eagles just ended the Kansas City Chiefs' dream of becoming the first team to win a Super Bowl three-peat. Jalen Hurts showed his masterclass as Patrick Mahomes led Chiefs faced 22-40 defeat in New Orleans. Now it's time to visit the White House for the Eagles. Though they were not invited back in 2018 by Donald Trump, now history is awaiting again. Will they visit this time or again snub visiting? We will know this, but how visiting White House by the Super Bowl winner started and became a tradition?The tradition of sports teams visiting the White House has deep historical roots, dating back to August 30, 1865, when President Andrew Johnson welcomed the Brooklyn Atlantics and Washington Nationals, two amateur baseball clubs.However, it wasn't until 1980 that the Super Bowl champions were formally invited. That year, President Jimmy Carter hosted a joint ceremony for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the World Series-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, marking a precedent that has since evolved into a presidential custom.The Steelers had just secured their fourth Super Bowl title with a 31-19 victory over the Los Angeles Rams at the Rose Bowl. The Pirates, on the other hand, had triumphed in the World Series. To honor both teams, Carter, a known baseball enthusiast and lifelong Braves fan, orchestrated a celebratory event at the White House on February 22, 1980, just before the start of baseball’s spring training. In what would become a long-standing tradition, Carter was presented with unique team memorabilia, including the Steelers’ signature “Terrible Towel” and a Pirates cap.Carter’s appreciation for sports' unifying power was evident. “How delighted I am to join in with all of you in this salute to a place that really deserves to be called the City of Champions,” he remarked. “I want to include in this salute not only Pittsburgh itself but to the entire western region of Pennsylvania, because I don’t know of any team or set of teams that have had such overwhelming and constant and enthusiastic support than these two teams have had from the entire region of Pennsylvania.” His vision of using sports to bring people together laid the foundation for a tradition that has since adapted to changing times and leadership styles.Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, later reflected on Carter’s impact. ""It really was Carter who saw the magic of sports to bring people together. [He] began a tradition that has evolved and taken on different manifestations with different presidencies.” Following Carter’s loss in the 1980 election, President Ronald Reagan upheld the practice, extending invitations to championship-winning teams across various professional leagues. Over the years, college teams and women’s sports champions also found a place in the White House celebrations.The tradition often includes ceremonial remarks from the sitting president and the presentation of a team jersey. Some teams have added personal touches to their gifts, such as the Green Bay Packers giving President Barack Obama, a known Chicago Bears fan, an ownership share in the team in 2011.While the White House visit was originally a lighthearted celebration, the intersection of sports and politics has made it increasingly controversial. One of the most notable instances occurred in 2017 when President Donald Trump withdrew the Golden State Warriors’ invitation after Steph Curry expressed disinterest in attending. Trump’s criticism of Curry led to a fiery response from LeBron James, who famously tweeted, calling the president a “bum.”Similarly, the Philadelphia Eagles faced a contentious situation after winning their first Super Bowl in 2018. Amid tensions over national anthem protests, Trump rescinded their invitation, claiming that several players were not planning to attend. The backlash was swift, with Philadelphia’s Mayor’s Office slamming the move, labeling Trump “a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend.”Also Read: Will the Eagles visit White House following their Super Bowl win? Lane Johnson says it will be a ""Team decision"" Fast forward to 2025, the scenario has come full circle. Trump, having secured a second term, made history by becoming the first sitting U.S. president to attend a Super Bowl. As the Eagles clinched another championship, the question remains—will they accept a likely invitation to the White House, or will political tensions once again overshadow the celebration?","The tradition of Super Bowl champions visiting the White House has deep historical roots. President Jimmy Carter hosted a joint ceremony for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the World Series-winning Pittsburgh Pirates in 1980. The White House visit was originally a lighthearted celebration, but the intersection of sports and politics has made it increasingly controversial.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118143435,imgsize-67474,width-400,resizemode-4/118143435.jpg"

I’m sorry.” He also shared a video, saying “My comment wasn’t appropriate. It wasn’t even funny. Comedy is not my forte”.He further added “I’m just here to say sorry. Many of you asked if this is how I wished to use my platform and obviously this is not how I wish to use it. I am not going to give any context or justification or reasoning behind whatever happened. I’m just here for an apology.”“I personally had a lapse in judgement. I wasn't cool on my part. The podcast was watched by people of all ages.

Israel's fatal shooting of a pregnant Palestinian woman puts the focus on West Bank violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-fatal-shooting-of-a-pregnant-palestinian-woman-puts-the-focus-on-west-bank-violence/articleshow/118161390.cms,"KAFR AL-LABAD: The call came in the middle of the night, Mohammed Shula said. His daughter-in-law, eight months pregnant with her first child, was whispering. There was panic in her voice.""Help, please,"" Shula recalled her saying. ""You have to save us.""Minutes later, Sondos Shalabi was fatally shot.Shalabi and her husband, 26-year-old Yazan Shula , had fled their home in the early hours of Sunday as Israeli security forces closed in on Nur Shams refugee camp, a crowded urban district in the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem.Israeli military vehicles surrounded the camp days earlier, part of a larger crackdown on Palestinian militants across the northern occupied West Bank that has escalated since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza took effect last month. Israeli defense minister Israel Katz has announced the expansion of the army's operations, saying it aimed to stop Iran - Hamas' ally - from opening up a new front in the occupied territory.Palestinians see the shooting of Shalabi, 23, as part of a worrying trend toward more lethal, warlike Israeli tactics in the West Bank. The Israeli army issued a short statement afterward, saying it had referred her shooting to the military police for criminal investigation.Also on Sunday, just a few streets away, another young Palestinian woman, 21, was killed by the Israeli army. An explosive device it had planted detonated as she approached her front door.In response, the Israeli army said that a wanted militant was in her house, compelling Israeli forces to break down the door. It said the woman did not leave despite the soldiers' calls. The army said it ""regrets any harm caused to uninvolved civilians.""Across the West Bank and east Jerusalem, at least 905 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Many appear to have been militants killed in gunbattles during Israeli raids. But rock-throwing protesters and uninvolved civilians - including a 2-year-old girl, a 10-year-old boy and 73-year-old man - have also been killed in recent weeks.""The basic rules of fighting, of confronting the Palestinians, is different now,"" said Maher Kanan, a member of the emergency response team in the nearby village of Anabta, describing what he sees as the army's new attitude and tactics. ""The displacement, the number of civilians killed, they are doing here what they did in Gaza.""Mohammed Shula, 58, told The Associated Press that his son and daughter-in-law said they started plotting their flight from Nur Shams last week as Israeli drones crisscrossed the sky, Palestinian militants boobytrapped the roads and their baby's due date approached.His son ""was worried about (Shalabi) all the time. He knew that she wouldn't be able to deliver the baby if the siege got worse,"" he said.Yazan Shula, a construction worker in Israel who lost his job after the Israeli government banned nearly 2,00,000 Palestinian workers from entering its territory, couldn't wait to be a father, his own father said.Shalabi, quiet and kind, was like a daughter to him - moving into their house in Nur Shams 18 month sago, after marrying his son. ""This baby is what they were living for,"" he said.Early Sunday, the young couple packed up some clothes and belongings. The plan was simple - they would drive to the home of Shalabi's parents outside the camp, some miles away in Tulkarem where soldiers weren't operating. It was safer there, and near the hospital where Shalabi planned to give birth. Yazan Shula's younger brother, 19-year-old Bilal, also wanted to get out and jumped in the backseat.Not long after the three of them drove off, there was a burst of gunfire. Mohammed Shula's phone rang.His daughter-in-law's breaths came in gasps, he said. An Israeli sniper had shot her husband, she told her father-in-law, and blood was flowing from the back of his head. She was unscathed, but had no idea what to do.He coached her into staying calm. He told her to knock on the door of any house to ask for help. Her phone on speaker, he could hear her knocking and shrieking, he said. No one was answering.She told him she could see soldiers approaching. The line went dead, said Mohammed Shula, who then called the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service.""We couldn't go outside because we were afraid we'd be shot,"" said Suleiman Zuheiri, 65, a neighbor of the Shula family who was helping the medics reach their bodies. ""We tried and tried. All in vain. (The medics) kept getting turned back, and the girl kept bleeding.""Bilal Shula wasn't hurt. He was arrested from the scene and detained for several hours.The Red Crescent said that the International Committee of the Red Cross had secured approval from the Israeli military to allow medics inside the camp. But the paramedics were detained twice, for a half-hour each time, as they made their way toward the battered car, it said.When asked why soldiers had blocked ambulances, the Israeli military repeated that it launched an investigation into the events surrounding Shalabi's killing.It wasn't until after 8 a.m. that medics finally reached the young couple, and were detained a third time while rushing the husband out of the camp to the hospital, the Red Crescent said.Yazan Shula was unconscious and in critical condition, and, as of Tuesday, remains on life support at a hospital. Shalabi was found dead. Her fetus also did not survive the shooting.Mohammed Shula keeps thinking about how soldiers saw Shalabi's body bleeding on the ground and did nothing to help as they handcuffed his other son and marched him into their vehicle.""Why did they shoot them? They were doing nothing wrong. They could have stopped them, asked a question, but no, they just shot,"" he said, his fingers busily rubbing a strand of prayer beads.Israeli security forces invaded the camp some hours later. Explosions resounded through the alleyways. Armored bulldozers rumbled down the roads, chewing up the pavement and rupturing underground water pipes. The electricity went out. Then the taps ran dry.Before Mohammed Shula could process what was happening, he said, Israeli troops banged on his front door and ordered everyone - his daughter, son and several grandchildren, one of them a year old, another 2 months old - to leave their home.The Israeli military denied it was carrying out forcible evacuations in the West Bank, saying that it was facilitating the departure of civilians who wanted to leave the combat zone on their own accord. It did not respond to follow-up questions about why over a dozen Palestinian civilians interviewed in Nur Shams camp made the same claims about their forcible displacement.Mohammed Shula pointed to a bag of baby diapers in the corner of his friend's living room. That's all he had time to bring with him, he said, not even photographs, or clothes.","Sondos Shalabi and her husband fled their home in the early hours of Sunday as Israeli security forces closed in.

No word on terms of exchange yet



When and why was Fogel imprisoned and convicted?



US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has secured the release of an American detained in Russia during a trip to the country, the White House said on Tuesday.History teacher Marc Fogel , from Pennsylvania, was detained in August 2021 at a Russian airport, for possession of what he and his family said was medically prescribed marijuana.""President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,"" White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said.Witkoff and Fogel had left Russian airspace together on Tuesday, following an unannounced visit by the envoy, and he was expected to be reunited with his family later in the day, Waltz said.Soon after the announcement, Fogel's relatives said they were ""beyond grateful, relieved and overwhelmed"" that he was coming home.""This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal,"" they said. ""For the first time in years, our family can look forward to the future with hope.""Waltz did not describe what the exchange entailed. Previous exchanges have often involved the reciprocal release of Russian detainees imprisoned by the US or its allies.The most notable recent deal of this kind took place in August 2024, when three prominent Russian dissidents and US reporter Evan Gershkovic were released in exchange for eight Russian citizens including an intelligence agent who had been jailed for a 2019 murder in a Berlin park.Fogel was detained in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport in August 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana — which he said he uses for medical reasons — in his luggage.Fogel's was sentenced in June 2022, following the sharp downturn in US-Russian relations amid Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to 14 years in prison on drug smuggling charges.A few months later he had been transferred from a Moscow jail to a penal colony where he was set to serve the remainder of his sentence.In December 2024, following protests by family and supporters, the outgoing Biden administration declared him to be ""wrongfully detained.""The 63-year-old history teacher born in Butler, Pennsylvania, worked in international schools in several countries around the world during his career.

The United States and United Kingdom declined to sign the Paris AI summit's declaration promoting ""inclusive and sustainable"" artificial intelligence, undermining efforts for a unified approach to development and regulation.Neither nation provided immediate justification for abstaining from the agreement, which garnered support from 60 nations including Inida, China, Japan, Australia and Canada.A spokesperson for the UK Prime Minister quoted by the the Associated Press acknowledged France as a key AI partner but emphasised that Britain would only endorse initiatives serving national interests. ""You'd only ever expect us to sign up to initiatives that we judge to be in our national interest,"" the spokesman told reporters.However, in response to queries about the United Kingdom's decision not to endorse the declaration and its possible connection to the United States' stance, the spokesperson stated they had ""not aware of the US reasons or position"" regarding the declaration. The official refrained from speculating about American motivations behind the choice.The rejection came following US Vice-President JD Vance's critical address at the Grand Palais, where he denounced European ""excessive regulation"" of technology and warned against Chinese collaboration.The declaration emphasises ""ensuring AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy, taking into account international frameworks for all"" and ""making AI sustainable for people and the planet"".French officials indicated additional nations might endorse the declaration post-event.Vance's speech, delivered before leaders, including co-chairs Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French PM Emmanuel Macron , addressed concerns about global AI regulation approaches.

The Obama Connection: The Senate Seat Scandal

Trump's Involvement: From Reality TV to Presidential Clemency

Former Governor Rod Blagojevich Gets Going

A State Marred by Political Corruption

Controversy Surrounding the Pardon

US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Rod Blagojevich , the former Democratic governor of Illinois. Blagojevich was convicted in 2011 on multiple corruption charges, including attempting to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama following his 2008 presidential election. This pardon follows Trump's commutation of Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence in 2020, which led to his release after serving eight years.In December 2008, after Barack Obama was elected president, his Illinois Senate seat became vacant. As governor, Blagojevich had the authority to appoint a successor. Federal investigators, however, had been monitoring Blagojevich and recorded conversations in which he discussed leveraging the appointment for personal gain. He infamously referred to the seat as ""f***ing golden,"" emphasizing its value. Prosecutors alleged that Blagojevich sought bribes, political favors, or a high-ranking position in exchange for the appointment.While Obama and his team were not implicated in the scandal, the situation cast a shadow over the early days of his administration. Internal investigations found no evidence of improper discussions between Obama's staff and Blagojevich.Blagojevich's relationship with Trump dates back to his 2010 appearance on ""The Celebrity Apprentice ,"" a reality TV show hosted by Trump. Although Blagojevich was eliminated early in the competition, this connection resurfaced years later. In 2020, Trump commuted Blagojevich's sentence, describing it as excessive and unjust. At that time, Trump stated, ""I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people I had to deal with.""Upon his release, Blagojevich expressed profound gratitude to Trump, referring to himself as a ""Trumpocrat."" He maintained his innocence, asserting that he was a victim of a politicized justice system.Illinois has a notorious history of political corruption. Blagojevich became the fourth Illinois governor to serve time in prison, joining predecessors Otto Kerner, Dan Walker, and George Ryan. This pattern of corruption has plagued the state for decades, affecting various levels of government.Trump's decision to pardon Blagojevich has elicited mixed reactions. Supporters argue that the former governor's sentence was disproportionately harsh compared to similar cases. Critics contend that the pardon undermines efforts to combat political corruption and may embolden unethical behavior among public officials.Legal experts emphasize that a presidential pardon does not equate to exoneration; it merely removes the legal penalties associated with a conviction. Blagojevich's disbarment and the Illinois Senate's ban on him holding state office remain unaffected by the pardon.As Blagojevich resumes public life, the debate continues over the implications of his pardon and its impact on perceptions of justice and political accountability in Illinois and beyond.","US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois.

Kennedy’s assassination following President Trump’s executive order to release the secret files.The document contains 14,000 pages worth of material that disclosure board was supposed to review but never saw. However, the newly discovered documents remains secret at least for now.Earlier in January, Trump had ordered the declassification of all remaining classified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, fulfilling a long-standing promise.The move was formalised through an executive order, which also called for the release of files concerning the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.During his re-election campaign, Trump had pledged to release the remaining Kennedy assassination files, a promise he also made during his first term but later walked back, citing advice from intelligence officials.","Congresswoman's claims contradict Warren Commission's conclusion which determined that JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald, who acted alone.

States push back



A federal appeals court has rejected the US President Donald Trump's administration's bid to overturn a lower court ruling that blocked the president from freezing billions in federal funding, grants, and loans, reports ABC News.The decision was delivered by the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and coincided with President Trump's statement to ABC in which he said he would ""always abide by the courts.""The three-judge panel, all nominated by Democratic presidents, issued a two-page order denying the administration's request for an immediate administrative stay. They noted that the department of justice failed to present supporting evidence for its request or demonstrate any harm caused by the lower court's ruling.""This Circuit has not addressed whether or when an administrative stay of the sort being requested here may be issued, and there is well-recognized uncertainty as to what standards guide the decision to issue one or not,"" the judges wrote in the legal document.The dispute began when the Trump administration attempted to freeze funding through a directive from the Office of Management and Budget, which was later rescinded.US district judge John McConnell of Rhode Island ruled that the attempt likely violated the Constitution. On Monday, he issued a second order, accusing the administration of continuing to block funding despite his initial ruling.DOJ lawyers argued that the ruling improperly restricted presidential authority. ""This appeal arises from an extraordinary and unprecedented assertion of power by a single district court judge to superintend and control the Executive Branch's spending of federal funds, in clear violation of the Constitution's separation of powers,"" they were quoted as saying according to ABC News.The administration argues that the ruling makes it too difficult for federal agencies to manage funding, calling it ""self-evidently unworkable.""Attorneys general from 23 states strongly oppose the appeal, arguing that the funding freeze would severely impact millions of Americans who rely on federal assistance. They emphasised that the freeze affects crucial sectors, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure.""This case challenges defendants' implementation of a policy imposing across-the-board blanket freezes on payments to all recipients of federal funding associated with nearly all federal programs across the Nation, ranging from healthcare funding to education funding to critical energy and infrastructure grants ,"" they argued in the lawsuit.They also warned that lifting the lower court's order would allow the administration to resume its ""sweeping and illegal policy,"" harming states and the many recipients of federal funding within their jurisdictions.The court will review the request for a stay pending appeal later this week, having already rejected the administration's bid for an immediate pause.

Harry Meghan Latest News: Prince Harry too small a fry for Donald Trump and he can't deport Meghan Markle: Royal experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prince-harry-too-small-a-fry-for-donald-trump-and-he-cant-deport-meghan-markle-royal-experts/articleshow/118156318.cms,"Donald Trump said he would not deport Prince Harry.

Royal experts think President Donald Trump made a funny comment when he said he won't deport Prince Harry from the United States as he already has a terrible wife, Meghan Markle but Harry should now keep his head down and focus on his charitable works. British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News that Trump admired the Royal family and won;t unnecessarily jeopardize his relationship with the working members.""His stance is America first,"" said Chard. ""He is strong on border control, immigration and deportation. Despite his funny statement highlighting he won't deport Harry, he could well have a change of heart if Harry is found guilty of lying on his visa documents. Prince Harry could be the perfect poster boy… however, Trump dislikes Meghan and deporting Meghan is not on the cards.""Meghan Markle is an American and after their exit from the Royal Family, Harry and Meghan made Montecito their home, though Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against Harry questioning whether Harry disclosed in his visa forms that he took marijuana, cocaine as he acknowledged in his memoir which was published years after he came to the US.""Trump speaks highly and values our monarchy,"" said Chard. ""For this reason, he is giving poor hoodwinked Harry a right to stay in the US. Prince Harry is a small fry for Trump to bother with. He has more important issues to deal with.""""I always doubted that Harry would be deported over the visa application issue,"" Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said. ""Donald Trump values his relationship with the royal family.

Kash Patel accused of directing purge at FBI before he’s even confirmed to lead it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-accused-of-directing-purge-at-fbi-before-hes-even-confirmed-to-lead-it/articleshow/118155612.cms,"WASHINGTON: The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday accused Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's nominee for FBI director, of improperly directing a wave of firings at the bureau before being confirmed.In a letter to the Justice Department's inspector general, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois cited ""highly credible information from multiple sources"" that suggested Patel had been personally involved in covertly orchestrating a purge of career officials at the FBI.""This alleged misconduct is beyond the pale and must be investigated immediately,"" Durbin wrote to the independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz.The accusation comes as the committee prepares to vote Thursday on whether to send Patel's nomination to the Senate floor. Durbin said that if the allegations were true, then the acting No. 2 at the Justice Department, Emil Bove, fired career civil servants ""solely at the behest of a private citizen,"" and also that Patel ""may have perjured himself"" at his confirmation hearing last month.Representatives for the Justice Department, the White House and Patel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Durbin sent the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, on Tuesday. He is expected to deliver a speech on the Senate floor about the matter.In his letter, Durbin recounted a meeting between Bove, who has helped spearhead mass firings of Justice Department prosecutors, and FBI leadership. Bove supposedly told bureau officials that Stephen Miller, a White House aide, was pressuring him on Patel's behalf to move more quickly in firing senior career officials at the bureau.Durbin cited verbal accounts from ""multiple sources"" and quoted what he described as contemporaneous meeting notes as further corroboration. Durbin's letter said the notes read: ""KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ.""Durbin did not identify his sources, but from the context, they did not appear to be direct witnesses to interactions involving Patel or Miller, but rather people at the FBI who heard, or perhaps heard about, what Bove had supposedly said.In Senate testimony last month, Patel said he was ""not aware"" of any Trump administration plans to fire FBI officials associated with investigations into Trump. Patel also told the senators, ""I don't know what's going on right now over there.""But as a further reason to question Patel's testimony, Durbin said members of a newly established group of Trump political appointees at the FBI have kept Patel informed. Each member of that group, known as the FBI director's advisory team, Durbin said, had told one or more FBI officials before Patel's confirmation hearing on January 30 that they had been in direct contact with him.The referral to Horowitz comes after Trump summarily fired 17 inspectors general across the executive branch. Horowitz has so far been spared, intensifying the stakes of opening any investigation.A series of reassignments, forced transfers and ousters across the Justice Department -- including firing all prosecutors who had worked on the two criminal cases against Trump -- prompted lawmakers to press Patel during his hearing about whether the FBI would be subject to a similar shake-up.Hours after Patel's testimony, word began to emerge that about half a dozen of the FBI's most senior leaders had been told they would be fired within days if they did not retire or resign. A day later, an all-staff memo to the FBI said that Bove had demanded their ouster, along with the names of all agents who helped investigate events related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.Bove had served as one of Trump's criminal defense lawyers before Trump made him the acting deputy attorney general, putting him in the unusual position of overseeing prosecutors he had just opposed in court.Durbin recounted what he described as two meetings on the day before Patel's testimony.On January 29, the acting leaders of the FBI, Brian Driscoll and Robert C. Kissane, convened a meeting at which they warned that ""a lot of names were people in the crosshairs"" and that a group of top career supervisors must retire or be fired, it said.That meeting had been prompted, the letter said, by one earlier that day between the top FBI officials and Trump administration appointees at the Justice Department.At that earlier meeting, Durbin said in his letter, Bove had revealed who was orchestrating the push, informing the FBI leaders that he had ""received multiple calls from Stephen Miller the night before. Miller was pressuring him because Patel wanted the FBI to remove targeted employees faster as DOJ had already done with prosecutors,"" according to the letter.The contemporaneous notes cited by Durbin as corroboration appear to be from this earlier meeting.Driscoll and Kissane apparently resisted Bove's demands, leading him to instruct them two days later to tell senior leaders that they faced termination, and to demand they turn over a list of all agents and analysts who participated in the investigations related to the riot. Driscoll revealed that demand in the memo to FBI employees later that day.Bove, in his own memo to the bureau workforce on February 5, accused the FBI leaders of ""insubordination,"" saying he had broadened his request after Driscoll and Kissane ""refused to comply"" with multiple requests to help him identify the ""core team"" of investigators in Washington.Durbin warned of the potentially deleterious effects of mass dismissals and reassignments across the bureau.""The leadership and experience vacuum created by these actions has greatly weakened the FBI's ability to protect the country from numerous national security threats and has made Americans less safe,"" he said.",Sen. Dick Durbin says Kash Patel may have perjured himself at his confirmation hearing. He says Patel was personally involved in covertly orchestrating a purge of career officials at the FBI. The accusation comes as the committee prepares to vote Thursday on whether to send Patel's nomination to the Senate floor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118155655,imgsize-819738,width-400,resizemode-4/118155655.jpg"

NEW YORK: The US justice department ordered federal prosecutors on Monday to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams , after his rapprochement with President Donald Trump The first sitting New York mayor to be criminally indicted, Adams in September pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and bribery, and rebuffed calls for his resignation.The Democratic mayor had asserted -- without evidence -- that he was being punished for his criticism of former president Joe Biden's immigration policies. In recent weeks, he ramped up contact with associates of Republican President Trump.In a memo from the Justice Department, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove -- a former Trump lawyer -- told the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York to drop the charges.""You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges in United States v. Adams,"" said the memo, obtained and published by The New York Times.Bove's memo said the timing of the charges and the investigation had ""improperly interfered"" with Adam's 2025 mayoral campaign .""The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime,"" Bove added.Once touted as a future Democratic Party star, Adams was thrust into political hot water last year after multiple probes into alleged corruption.Prosecutors accused him of wire fraud, soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations and a bribery conspiracy involving Turkish citizens and at least one Turkish official.He also allegedly accepted luxury international flights, hotel suites and free high-end restaurant meals, including from Turkish associates, in return for favors.In one example, prosecutors say Adams pressured the city's fire department to approve Turkey's new high-rise consulate in Manhattan despite safety concerns.The scandal has cast a pall on his reelection bid in November.Adams's lawyer Alex Spiro on Monday praised the Justice Department's decision.""As I said from the outset, the mayor is innocent -- and he would prevail. Today he has,"" Spiro said in an email to AFP.The office of Danielle Sassoon, the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, has not yet issued a public response to Bove's memo.Trump reportedly expressed solidarity with Adams last year, saying that he was being prosecuted ""for speaking out against open borders.""Adams had met with Trump in January before his inauguration and said they had ""a productive conversation about New York's needs,"" adding that they ""did not discuss my legal case.""New York Civil Liberties Union on Monday called the Justice Department's directive ""another example of the Trump administration hijacking the Justice Department for its own ends.""""The Mayor's late and surprise embrace of Trump and his push to undermine longstanding city laws protecting immigrants is alarming,"" it said, adding that Adams ""is betraying our communities.""","New York Mayor Eric Adams was the first sitting mayor to be criminally indicted.

An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

ISLAMABAD: Afghan authorities have refused to receive the body of the son of a senior Afghan Taliban official who was killed, allegedly in a recent military offensive in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province bordering Afghanistan, state media claimed on Monday.Citing sources, Radio Pakistan referred to an intelligence-based operation conducted in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Friday in which, the military claims, four terrorists were killed. “Among those killed was the son of the deputy governor (Maulvi Ghulam Muhammad Ahmadi, 55) of Baghdis province of Afghanistan. He was identified as Badaruddin, alias Yousaf,” it claimed, adding the Afghan authorities had refused to receive the body despite multiple requests from Pakistan.Radio Pakistan stated that US-made night vision equipment, along with M16A4 and M24 sniper rifles, were recovered from the terrorists who were killed.“Badaruddin was directly involved in the new wave of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan into Pakistan. The Afghan Taliban leadership still maintains close ties with terrorist organisations, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),” the report said. It claimed that Badaruddin had previously received training at an Afghan Taliban training centre and later joined TTP.Pakistan alleges the Afghan govt harbours armed groups, particularly TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. Last month, Pakistan had repatriated the body of an Afghan national allegedly involved in terrorist activities in Zhob district of Balochistan province in the southwest. On that, the military’s media wing, had said the incident was “irrefutable evidence” of the involvement of Afghan nationals in terrorist activities in Pakistan.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing the use of their territory for cross-border attacks.","The son of a senior Afghan Taliban official was killed, allegedly in a recent military offensive in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province bordering Afghanistan.

The attack led to a temporary shutdown of the stall at the 'Amar Ekushey' book fair by police, sparking widespread outrage over increasing intolerance toward free speech in the country.Alleging that the Yunus-led interim govt is supporting ""extremists"", Taslima wrote on X: ""Jihadist religious extremists attacked the stall of the publisher Sabyasachi at Bangladesh's book fair. Their crime was publishing my book. The book fair authorities and the police from the local station ordered the removal of my book.

DHAKA : Bangladesh's election commission (EC) on Tuesday said preparations were underway to stage general elections by December as nationwide vandalisms over the past week prompted the interim government chief Muhammad Yunus to agree to the proposal. The EC's comments came a day after Yunus assured former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to hold elections by December.Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Mohammad Sanaullah told journalists: ""We are preparing for the national elections in December (this year).""He was speaking after a meeting with diplomats of 17 western and other countries alongside the United Nations and European Union (EU) representatives here.Instead of local government elections, as proposed by a government-appointed commission, national election is the priority, Sanaullah, who was flanked by the diplomats, said.He said the chief adviser earlier mentioned two deadlines but ""we, however, are preparing for the first date.""UN resident representative Stefan Liller, who attended the meeting, said the United Nations expected the upcoming polls to be the best in Bangladesh's history and ""we are supporting the EC to conduct a free and fair election.""He, however, declined to comment on challenges of holding such elections, saying ""that is not for me to comment.""On Monday, chief adviser Yunus assured Zia's BNP to hold elections by December as per the party's demand of quickest possible timing citing reasons of deteriorated law and order situation and the precarious economic conditions.""He (Yunus) informed us that the government is working to hold the election by December,"" BNP secretary general Mirja Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told journalists after a meeting with the chief adviser late on Monday night.Yunus assumed the charge of Bangladesh's interim government on August 8, 2024, three days after the ouster of the then prime minister Sheikh Hasina 's Awami League regime in an uprising led by the anti-discrimination student movement.His council of advisers, effectively the cabinet, which includes three student movement leaders, launched a reform campaign constituting several commissions to recommend restructuring of the country's administrative systems and also Bangladesh's original 1972 constitution.The government-instituted commissions submitted their reports while the one for the constitutional reform proposed a series of changes in the charter.The constitution reform commission recommended changing state principles, deleting ""secularism"" and ""nationalism"" and suggested, if needed, the charter should be scrapped entirely instead of amendments, which was done previously several times.The anti-discrimination student movement that led the uprising earlier vowed to ""bury"" the 1972 constitution calling it a ""Mujibist"" charter, a reference to the country's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.In view of visibly mounting pressures from the BNP and other major parties, Yunus earlier said the polls could be held after minimal reforms by December or after substantial ones in June 2026.The students' platform hinted they were set to float a political party themselves prompting BNP to demand early elections while it also expressed fears about the government's neutrality during the polls as the students' platform hinted to float a political party of their own to take part in the election.BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the government could not evade responsibilities of countrywide vandalism incidents in recent days as ""we have seen that those incidents happened one after another in front of law enforcement and other government agencies.""""As a result of these incidents the overall law and order situation deteriorated to a large extent,"" he said after the meeting with Yunus at his official Jamuna residence.The incidents he referred to started earlier this month when a mob demolished Mujib's residence at 32 Dhanmondi on February 5 under what they called a ""bulldozer procession"" with little government interference to stop them.The mobs subsequently carried out a nationwide mayhem setting on fire or demolishing Hasina's close relatives and party leaders and government ministers across the country.Most of the ministers or leaders of Hasina's party and several police and administrative officials are now behind bars or hiding at home and abroad to evade arrests, mainly on charges of ruthlessly suppressing the uprising by allegedly killing several hundred people during the July-August uprising.",Bangladesh's election commission says preparations are underway to stage general elections by December.
