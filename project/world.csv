Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

Yes, it should be considered No, it complicates cases too much

LUCKNOW: Accused of plotting to murder her husband during their honeymoon, Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.This facet came to light during interrogation of Lalitpur native Akash Rajput, who said Sonam feared her father would die of heart attack if she did not marry as per his wish.According to Rajput's statement, Sonam's father Devi Singh suffers from a serious heart condition, and she was reportedly convinced that her refusal to marry Raja would trigger a fatal heart attack.Despite her personal reluctance and reported feelings for another man, Sonam got married just to fulfil her father's wish and, to safeguard his health thereby.Investigators believe that soon after Sonam married Raja, her lover Raj Kushwaha got agitated by the union and police allege this resentment was at the root of the plot to eliminate Raja just five days after the wedding.Police said Rajput revealed the murder plan was hatched and discussed in a café located next to Sonam's residence near Nandbagh colony in Indore.This proximity raises further questions about the extent of Sonam's knowledge, if any, regarding the plan, although current police statements point at her coerced marriage as primary motive for her actions leading to the murder.Police are now working on corroborating Akash Rajput's testimony and are interrogating Raj Kushwaha, believed to be the central figure in the murder case.","Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.

GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Friday issued a shoot-at-sight order in the India-Bangladesh border town of Dhubri after dusk to rein in what CM Himanta Biswa Sarma described as ""a communal group"" fomenting trouble over the past week.The immediate trigger for the directive to enforcement agencies, including Rapid Action Force and CRPF reinforcements, was a purported poster campaign by the group for ""Dhubri's integration with Bangladesh"".The town has been on the edge for several days following mob violence over offal being found near a place of worship.CM, who was in Dhubri district to take stock, said police found at least three provocative posters put up by a group identified as Nabin Bangla at different locations there.""Since the last one week, maintaining law and order in Dhubri has been challenging.

Trump-Musk feud continues? White House orders review of SpaceX contracts after fallout: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-feud-continues-white-house-orders-review-of-spacex-contracts-after-fallout-report/articleshow/121841289.cms,"Elon Musk with Donald Trump in Oval office (File photo)

The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions following President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk , according to four sources familiar with the directive who spoke to Reuters.The administration instructed these agencies to examine Musk's contracts to prepare potential actions against the entrepreneur and his enterprises, these sources indicated. Pentagon officials are also evaluating whether to limit SpaceX's involvement in a new American missile defence initiative, as Reuters reported on Thursday.While the ultimate intention regarding SpaceX's current federal contracts worth approximately $22 billion remains unclear, the assessment will mark the administration's follow-through on Trump's June 6 statement to journalists aboard Air Force One, where he mentioned possible termination of business and subsidies for Musk's ventures, stating ""We'll take a look at everything.""A White House spokesperson, responding via email to Reuters, avoided specific questions about Musk's operations, stating the ""Trump administration is committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts."" Nasa's spokesperson separately indicated the agency would maintain collaboration with industry partners to achieve presidential space objectives.Sources familiar with the directive indicated the contract review aims to enable swift administrative action should Trump decide to move against Musk, who previously served as a senior presidential adviser and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).One source characterised the review as ""for political ammunition.""The feasibility of legally cancelling existing contracts remains uncertain. However, the situation highlights governance experts' worries about political and personal influences potentially affecting government spending, national security and public interest matters.Another Reuters report on Friday cited three people familiar with the project, claiming that the feud called into question the role of Musk's SpaceX in the new US missile defense system. Until recently, the White House considered a plan for SpaceX, Musk's rocket and satellite venture, to partner with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril to construct crucial elements of the project, dubbed ""Golden Dome. "" These people said the administration instructed the Pentagon to prioritize a network of satellites for the purpose.A new framework aimed at tracking and preventing potential missile attacks against the United States is currently under consideration, which could reduce SpaceX's involvement. Three individuals stated that one option might initially forego SpaceX's satellite capabilities to focus on expanding existing ground-based missile defence systems instead.Scott Amey, a contracting specialist at Washington's Project on Government Oversight, noted the situation's paradox, where Musk's contracts face similar subjective political scrutiny that his DOGE team applied to numerous other contracts, emphasising that decisions should prioritise public and national security interests over personal disputes.SpaceX has become essential to American government aerospace and defence operations, managing satellite launches and potentially overseeing a crucial component of Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system.Despite Musk's recent attempts to moderate his presidential criticisms, including his (now-deleted posts) impeachment call and allegations linking Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his outbursts highlighted government dependence on SpaceX.Before his reversal, Musk suggested decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently America's sole means of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a £5 billion Nasa contract.Additionally, SpaceX is developing a classified satellite network for the National Reconnaissance Office, strengthening its relationship with American defence and intelligence communities.The feud between Musk and Trump intensified after the Tesla owner criticised Trump’s key domestic bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files—a post Musk subsequently deleted. In response, Trump called Musk “a big-time drug addict” and mocked his appearance during a recent Oval Office visit.However, the tensions seemed to ease when Musk expressed ""regret"" saying he went too far. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote Wednesday on the platform he owns. In response, the White House signalled a possible softening of tone. “The President acknowledged the statement that Elon put out this morning, and he is appreciative of it,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions. The move follows President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk.

Iran strikes back after Israel's Operation Rising Lion; Netanyahu warns 'more is on the way',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-strikes-back-after-israels-operation-rising-lion-netanyahu-warns-more-is-on-the-way-what-happened-overnight/articleshow/121840211.cms,"'Everyone will feel it': Iran



'More is on the way': Netanyahu



Iran calls it response to 'criminal aggression'



'The world cannot stay silent': IDF



'Second barrage of missiles from Iran': IDF confirms



'I think it's been excellent': Donald Trump







A tense escalation unfolded across the Middle East overnight, as Iran launched back to back, and overnight missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and early Saturday. The move came in response to what Iran described as Israel’s earlier attacks on its territory.The confrontation began with Israel’s ""greatest military operations in history,"" against Iran.In a sweeping and highly coordinated attack on Thursday night, Israeli warplanes and drones, some of them reportedly smuggled into Iranian territory in advance, struck deep inside the Islamic Republic.Key targets included parts of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile production sites, and command centers. The strike also killed top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it.""Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its sweeping attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.""In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime's most significant enrichment facility, and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,"" declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a defiant video address. ""The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker.""Netanyahu also addressed the people of Iran directly: ""To the proud people of Iran, we are in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history, Operation Rising Lion. The Islamic regime, which has oppressed you for almost 50 years, threatens to destroy our country, the State of Israel. More is on the way.""That promise of escalation was swiftly realised — by both sides.Late Friday night, Iran responded with a salvo of ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territory. Explosions thundered over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as sirens blared and the Israeli military urged residents to take cover.Buildings shook under the pressure of near-simultaneous detonations, with several of them likely the result of Israel’s air defence systems intercepting incoming threats.In a pointed statement, Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the retaliatory attacks.""Using a combination of precision-guided and smart systems,"" the IRGC said, ""Iran targeted military centers and airbases that served as the source of the criminal aggression against our country.""The IRGC added that its missiles struck Israeli military-industrial centers that produce missiles and other war equipment, stating that ""field reports, satellite imagery, and intercepted intelligence indicate that dozens of ballistic missiles effectively hit strategic targets.""""Despite claims of interception, the enemy failed to counter the waves of missile strikes launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" the statement continued.But Israel maintained it had successfully intercepted a significant portion of the threat.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released footage of a Navy missile ship intercepting five Iranian drones over Israeli waters early Saturday. ""Attached is documentation of the interception of two drones launched earlier today from Iran,"" the IDF posted on social media platform X.The IDF also published a map highlighting areas across Israel currently under threat from Iranian attacks, warning, ""Israeli civilians are currently being targeted by the Iranian regime. The world cannot stay silent.""Inside a fortified command center, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant conducted ongoing situation assessments. According to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN, the leadership is ""fully engaged in real-time military coordination and strategic planning.""The attacks did not cease after Netanyahu's fiery speech. Minutes after his video was posted, more Iranian missiles were launched, with renewed explosions reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The tension inside Israel remained palpable as citizens were urged to stay inside shelters.Also read: Iran-Israel war: Iran airspace shut, international flights from India to take longer Israel also confirmed Iran's continued strikes and second barrage of missiles from Khamenei-led country.A senior Iranian official, speaking to CNN, warned that Iran is prepared to escalate even further: “Iran will intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that tries to defend it.”Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran while reaffirming support for Israel. ""Of course we support Israel in its actions,"" Trump told CNN. ""Iran better agree to a nuclear deal before there is nothing left.""“I think it’s been excellent,” Trump told ABC News about the Israeli strikes. “We gave Iran a chance, and they didn’t take it. They got hit—hard. As hard as you can get hit. And there’s more coming. A lot more.”Trump wrote on his Truth Social: ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance! ""As the skies over the Middle East lit up with missile trails and fireballs, the world watched anxiously, hoping the night’s violence would not spiral into a broader regional war. But with both sides promising more to come, a return to calm appears distant.","Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121840271,imgsize-823664,width-400,resizemode-4/121840271.jpg"

Kevin Durant was speculated to be dating former adult actress Lana Rhoades in 2021





Kevin Durant is single and dedicated to his game. It is what is evident from several interviews where he was prodded about his personal life. Durant is among those who want to keep their personal lives fairly private and want people to focus only on his game. However, his personal life was not always under wraps. Durant made it to the gossip columns when he got engaged to the player Monica Wright in 2013.However, the engagement did not culminate in marriage, and the couple parted ways in 2014, almost a year later. Several rumors have swirled after that about the women Durant has dated; however, he has remained tight-lipped on the matter and didn’t add fuel to those.Recapping the media reports that talked about Durant’s dating history, here are the rumored relationships that the Phoenix Suns star had in his life.Kevin Durant’s personal life is almost incomplete without the mention of Monica Wright, a friend from his high school days who became his fiancée later. Monica Wright was also a player, just like Kevin, and both met at the 2006 McDonald’s All-American Game, where they were standout players from their respective teams.How Durant and Wright’s relationship bloomed is not known in public circles, but they grabbed headlines when they broke the news of their engagement.ESPN reported in 2013 that the Minnesota Lynx star shared the news with fans after a win over the Phoenix Mercury in a Sunday game.However, the engagement remained short-lived.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.

South Africa's Eastern Cape province is experiencing massive floods, with the death toll reaching 78 as of Thursday. The search and rescue operations continue for the fourth day. Authorities said that they expect the toll to rise further.Videos and images of the floods have gone viral on social media, showing several houses submerged and vehicles swept away.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to visit the affected areas on Friday. His office confirmed that he will travel to the town of Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, the region hit hardest when the floods began in the early hours of Tuesday.Ramaphosa’s visit comes amid growing public criticism over the government’s slow response to the disaster. The floods were triggered by extreme weather conditions, including heavy rain, strong winds and even snow in some areas. Weather experts had warned of severe conditions last week.The head of the provincial government said rescue efforts were “paralysed” during the first few hours after the floods due to a lack of resources such as specialized search and rescue teams, divers and K-9 dog units.Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said the province, home to 7.2 million people, has just one official rescue helicopter, which had to be brought in from another city more than 500 kilometers away.The floods struck in the early morning hours, catching many residents off guard. Several victims were washed away along with parts of their homes and debris. Authorities said they expect more bodies to be recovered as rescue teams continue to search the floodwaters. Several people are still missing and many children are among the dead.Zinathi Vuso, a resident of Mthatha, said, “I need psychological help because I saw people dying in front of me. They were being dragged by the water along with the corrugated iron.""""Others tried to hold on or climb onto something, but it would break, and they ended up dead. That is why you’re still seeing people being recovered, and others are yet to be found,” she added.Cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister Velenkosini Hlabisa said on national broadcaster SABC late Thursday that authorities are urging residents to report missing persons to help rescuers get a better idea of how many people they are still searching for.“We are in a crisis. A real disaster,” Hlabisa said. “The more the water subsides, the more people will be found.”","South Africa's Eastern Cape province is experiencing massive floods, with the death toll reaching 78 as of Thursday.

The extreme heat consumed everything in its path — even birds and dogs couldn't escape.The London-bound Air India flight, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed into a residential area near the city airport minutes after takeoff on Thursday afternoon.“ There was 1.25 lakh litres of fuel inside the plane and it caught fire, so it was impossible to save anyone,” Union minister Amit Shah told reporters last night.A State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) official said their teams reached the crash site, the hostel and residential quarters of doctors and staff at BJ Medical College, between 2 and 2.30 pm. Locals had already pulled out a few people alive, but once the fire intensified, no more survivors could be found.“As the (aircraft's fuel) tank exploded, it created an inferno where temperature rose to 1,000 degrees Celsius in no time.This left little chance for anyone to escape,” said a senior fire official told news agency PTI.An SDRF responder said that though he had dealt with crisis situations before, nothing matched what he witnessed Thursday. “We came with PPE kits. But the temperature was so high, it made operations difficult. There were debris everywhere, already simmering, and we had to clear them,” he said.He claimed his team recovered 25–30 bodies, including those of children. “DNA tests will have to be done for recognition of bodies,” he added.Another SDRF official said he lost count of how many bodies he removed. “It was so quick that even animals and birds got little time to escape,” he said, pointing to carcasses in the residential complex.Besides passengers and crew members, students and others on the BJ Medical College premises were among those killed. Police said 265 bodies were brought to the civil hospital.A local resident of Meghani Nagar in Gujarat's Ahmedabad, who lives close to the crash site, also recounted the horror.Speaking to ANI, he termed the incident a ""horrible sight"" to witness, stating that there were half-cut and completely burnt bodies all over the area.A local who resides near the AI-171 crash site said, ""My son was there... He called me and told about the plane crash incident. My house is located 100-200m away from the crash site. The fire was still burning when I arrived...

Among those affected were services between India and cities like London, Toronto, and New York.Aircraft tracking site Flight Aware showed that two other Air India flights — from Delhi to Vienna and Mumbai to London — were nearing Iranian airspace and turned back to their origin airports shortly after the strikes began.In a statement, Air India said: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace and in view of the safety of our passengers, the following Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin. We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers due to this unforeseen disruption and are making every effort to minimise it.”The airline is offering full refunds or complimentary rescheduling to affected passengers and is arranging accommodation where necessary.The Indian Embassy in Iran also issued an advisory urging Indian nationals and people of Indian origin to stay alert and avoid non-essential travel, as tensions surged following Israel’s precision strikes targeting Iranian defence infrastructure.Iran, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria temporarily shut down their airspace, leading to widespread cancellations and rerouting of global flights to and from the Middle East. Global airlines suspended flights to Tel Aviv and Tehran as air traffic over the region thinned out overnight.Israel said the strikes were a direct response to the growing threat from Iran’s missile and nuclear capabilities. Iran retaliated by launching a wave of drones toward Israeli territory.","Flight was rerouted over Iraq before arriving in India one hour late.

How Muhammad Shahzeb Khan relied on messaging apps

Suspected ISIS Attack In Russia's Troubled Dagestan Region Kills 3 Cops; Gunmen Flee In Vehicle

A Pakistani national residing in Canada, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan , also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was extradited to the United States this week to face charges for plotting an ISIS-inspired mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City. The planned attack, intended to coincide with the first anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel. The plot was uncovered largely through Khan’s use of encrypted messaging apps, which reportedly played a critical role in both his planning and eventual apprehension.FBI Director Kash Patel said Muhammad Shahzeb Khan allegedly tried to enter the US to commit the attack and planned an ISIS-inspired mass shooting on October 7, 2024, around the first anniversary of the 2023 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel. ""Major news… earlier this afternoon, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada, was extradited to the United States on charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and attempting to commit acts of terrorism,"" Patel said in a post on Twitter.Khan, 20, was charged in the Southern District of New York, according to a Department of Justice press release. The investigation revealed that Khan relied heavily on encrypted messaging platforms to communicate his plans, believing these apps provided secure and untraceable communication. However, one of his contacts was an undercover FBI agent. The encrypted message that exposed Khan’s intentions was sent to this agent, whom Khan is said to have trusted as an ally. In a communication with undercover law enforcement officers, Khan claimed that if the plan succeeded, it would be ""the largest attack on US soil since 9/11."" In it, he also outlined his goal to kill ""as many Jewish people as possible"" in New York City on October 7, 2024.The investigation gained momentum after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested a father and son, Ahmed Eldidi and Mostafa Eldidi, on July 31, 2024, in connection with a separate terrorist plot in Ontario. This arrest is said to have spooked Khan, prompting him to send an encrypted message to his supposed associates, urging them to ""lay low"" and avoid social media to evade detection. The recipients were undercover agents who encouraged him to proceed with the attack, assuring him that weapons were ready. This deception kept Khan engaged, allowing authorities to reportedly gather further evidence through monitored encrypted communications.Khan arrived in Toronto on June 24, 2023, on a student visa, though it remains unclear which university he was enrolled in. On September 4, 2024, he began his journey toward the US border, starting in Toronto and driving to Napanee, Ontario, to pick up others allegedly involved in the plot. In Napanee, Khan and an unidentified female switched vehicles and continued to Montreal, where they changed cars again with another person driving. Approximately 19 kilometers from the US border, Canadian authorities stopped the vehicle and arrested Khan, thwarting the planned attack. He was provisionally arrested in Canada in September 2024 based on a complaint filed in the Southern District of New York.The case underscores the dual nature of encrypted messaging apps in modern terrorism investigations. While these platforms offer privacy and are widely used for legitimate purposes, they are also exploited by individuals planning illicit activities.","Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, was extradited to the United States this week to face charges for plotting an ISIS-inspired mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City.

The Trump administration this week gave deportation officials access to personal data, including immigration status, of millions of Medicaid enrollees, raising legal and ethical concerns within the government.Internal memos and emails revealed that officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) objected to the data transfer, arguing it could violate federal laws like the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, AP reported.Despite their objections, two senior advisers to health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr ordered the information be shared with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). CMS was given just 54 minutes on Tuesday to comply.A spokesperson for the department of health and human services (HHS), Andrew Nixon, said the data sharing was legal and in line with federal regulations. He declined to explain why the data was shared or how DHS plans to use it.The data included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and claimed information of people in California, Illinois, Washington state, and Washington, DC- states that allow non-citizens to receive state-funded Medicaid.The release came as immigration enforcement was increasing in Southern California.Experts said the information could be used to locate undocumented immigrants and potentially deny green cards, permanent residency, or citizenship to those who had received federally funded Medicaid benefits.California governor Gavin Newsom’s office expressed concern over the move, calling it “extremely concerning” and “potentially unlawful.” The statement also criticised the use of personal information in federal immigration enforcement efforts.Last month, CMS announced a targeted review of Medicaid enrollees in certain states to ensure federal funds were not used for people with “unsatisfactory immigration status.”The memo showed CMS officials tried to block DHS’s request, saying that the data was meant only for administering Medicaid, not for immigration enforcement.","The data included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and claimed information of people in California, Illinois, Washington state, and Washington, DC.

Iran launched a new wave of attacks on Israel early Saturday, according to state media, shortly after Israel’s military reported detecting incoming missiles from Iranian territory.""New round of Honest Promise 3 attacks,"" state television reported, referring to the name of the Iranian military operation against Israel, following deadly Israeli strikes on the Islamic republic, reported news agency AFP.The latest attacks followed hours after Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pledged retaliation for Israel’s strikes on the nation’s nuclear and military facilities, despite Tehran having already unleashed a deadly overnight missile barrage on Israel.In a recorded address to Iranians, Khamenei said: ""We will not permit them to evade consequences for this significant wrongdoing they have perpetrated"".Assuring that Iran's military was ready to respond, Khamenei said, ""Do not assume that they attacked and it's finished. No, they initiated the actions and began the conflict"".Tensions in the Middle East spiralled overnight as Iran fired missile strikes toward Israel late on Friday and into early Saturday.The attacks came in retaliation for the Operation ""Rising Lion"".The confrontation was triggered by what Israeli officials described as the nation’s ""greatest military operations in history"" against Iran. On Thursday night, Israel launched a massive, carefully coordinated offensive using warplanes and drones, some of which were reportedly pre-positioned inside Iran.The strikes penetrated deep into Iranian territory, hitting crucial sites including nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and key command hubs. Several high-ranking Iranian military officers and nuclear scientists were also killed in the operation.In the aftermath, Iran retaliated by launching a volley of ballistic missiles aimed at the heart of Tel Aviv, after its military issued a chilling warning that ""everyone will feel it.""Late Friday, Iran fired a fresh wave of ballistic missiles and drones toward Israeli cities. Loud explosions rocked Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as air raid sirens wailed, with Israeli authorities urging residents to find shelter immediately.Buildings trembled as near-simultaneous blasts echoed across the cities, some of which were believed to be the result of Israeli air defences intercepting incoming projectiles. Israel on Saturday said Iranian missile struck near homes in central Israel, injuring 10 people.","Iran launched a new wave of attacks on Israel early Saturday, according to state media.

Marines deployed by US President Donald Trump temporarily detained a civilian on Friday at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles, the first known incident of its kind amid ongoing protests over ICE raids, the US military has confirmed.A spokesperson for the US Northern Command clarified that while military personnel are not authorised to make arrests, they may temporarily detain individuals “in specific circumstances."" Such detentions, the spokesperson said, end immediately once the individual can be safely handed over to civilian law enforcement.The detained individual, 27-year-old Marcos Leao, later told reporters he was an Army veteran and had been on his way to a department of veterans affairs office when he inadvertently crossed a yellow tape boundary and was stopped. Leao, who became a US citizen through military service, said he was treated fairly. “They’re just doing their job,” he said.Video shows Marines restraining the man with zip ties before handing him over to personnel from the department of homeland security (DHS).The active duty forces took over security duties at the federal building earlier on Friday, as part of a broader deployment in response to days of protests over immigration raids.Currently, 200 Marines and over 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in LA to protect federal property and personnel. An additional 500 Marines and 2,000 National Guard troops are expected to join them.Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the US military is generally prohibited from engaging in civilian law enforcement activities.

Iran launched consecutive waves of missile and drone strikes on Israel overnight, in retaliation for Israel’s ""greatest military operations in history,"" conducted under Operation Rising Lion.The second barrage from Khamenei-led Islamic Republic came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation, saying more Israeli operations were under way.The first wave of Iranian strikes began late Friday, targeting Israeli cities including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.Explosions lit up the night sky as air raid sirens sounded across central Israel. The Israeli military said it had intercepted many of the incoming projectiles but acknowledged some impacts.""Iran targeted military centers and airbases that served as the source of the criminal aggression against our country,"" the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement.

""More is on the way,"" Netanyahu had warned, adding, ""The regime does not know what hit them — or what will hit them.

Point of no return: Army chief





JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Friday said the attacks were authorised over six months ago, in November 2024, and was initially scheduled for April 2025, but were postponed due to operational considerations. In a recorded speech in Hebrew, Netanyahu provided updates about the operation to citizens. A visibly elated Netanyahu said he will try to make such statements daily.""This didn't happen by chance or for trivial reasons - if Iran has nuclear weapons, we simply won't be here,"" he said. Netanyahu said that following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel made an assessment that Iran would expedite its nuclear programme, which it did. Earlier on Friday morning, in a video message, he said Iran has reached a level of uranium enrichment that it could soon develop some nine atom bombs. He also cautioned citizens not to be in euphoria over the success of the operation and stay calm and vigilant. He asserted that there would be retaliation and may be ""a price"" to pay.Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"". ""We cannot wait for another time to act, we have no choice,"" Zamir said.

The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies. Britain and the US provided backup in the form of fighter jets, refuelling planes and air defence systems. Neighbouring Jordan confirmed it had shot down Iranian missiles and drones. Some West Asian states allowed Israel to transit their airspace.This time around, there was less understanding and more concern. Some European allies worried Israel was ratcheting up a conflict with Iran after eight months of simmering tensions but no overt warfare. ""Escalation serves no one in the region,"" PM Keir Starmer of Britain said, while EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the situation ""dangerous"". Those remarks followed a growing chorus of European condemnation of Israel over the past few months for escalating the war in Gaza. Some of the sharpest condemnation came from countries in the region. Egypt, which has a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, called the strikes ""a direct threat to regional and international peace and security"".Still, a number of key allies, including the US, stood behind Israel and expressed mounting frustration with Iran's advancing nuclear programme. And should Iran launch a powerful counterattack against Israel, allies could still come to the country's defence militarily.","The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies.

For four decades, Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a grand project: building up a network of anti-Israel militias known as the ""Axis of Resistance"" that would join Iran if a war with Israel broke out.Friday's strikes underscored just how degraded that axis has become over the past year, with few expecting those armed groups to meaningfully respond to the Israeli aggression, experts say. In the clearest sign of that weakened stance, Hezbollah , the Lebanese militant group seen as Iran's most powerful proxy, condemned the attack but stopped short of vowing military action in response - a notable omission from a group that has long served as the central pillar of the axis.The Houthis in Yemen also made no mention of responding militarily. ""The axis hasn't been fully destroyed, but it has been diminished beyond the point of return,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. ""It has been transformed into an axis of sitting ducks waiting for the next Israeli strikes rather than taking initiative and pushing Israel into the defence.""Iran also lost a key ally in Dec, after Syrian rebels, whom Hezbollah fought, toppled Bashar al-Assad's govt in Syria. Among Iran's proxies, still intact are Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and the Houthis. ""Now the Houthis are the most capable and forthcoming of the axis, but at the same time, (Israeli) strikes have had an impact on their capacity,"" said Ali.","Iran poured billions of dollars, weapons and military minds into a network of anti-Israel militias.

JERUSALEM: Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems during Israel’s attack on nuclear and military targets, an Israeli security source said, while another official said Israel used a ploy to suggest the strike was not imminent.The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into the attacks.Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday. Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran.Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes.M ossad even smuggled weapons into Iran. The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran. The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said were its operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.The decision to strike Iran was made Monday, the same day Netanyahu and Trump spoke, when Netanyahu, defence minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin Friday, said a second source.

UAE airlines have suspended and cancelled flights to multiple destinations across the Middle East, Caucasus, and Central Asia after Israel launched a series of military strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets early Friday, June 13, 2025. The Israeli operation, codenamed “Rising Lion”, struck key facilities and killed several top Iranian military commanders, prompting Iran to shut down its airspace and triggering widespread disruption across regional flight routes.In immediate response to the escalating tensions and subsequent airspace closures, airlines operating out of the UAE, including Emirates, Etihad, flydubai, and Air Arabia, halted services to at least nine countries, namely: Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Additional suspensions also affected routes to and from Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, according to airline advisories and airport listings.The cancellations affected dozens of flights at Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Al Maktoum International (DWC), with airport authorities confirming delays and urging passengers to check with their airlines for the latest travel updates. Services to key cities such as Tehran, Shiraz, Lar, Kish Island, Bandar Abbas, Baghdad, Basra, Amman, Beirut, and Tel Aviv were either suspended or removed from schedules entirely for the day.Flights inbound from those cities were also disrupted.While some routes remain under review, many were either rerouted, significantly delayed, or returned to their points of origin mid-flight. Airport authorities stated they are working closely with airlines to manage the situation and assist impacted travellers.“Our teams are on hand to assist impacted guests,” Dubai Airports said, adding that passengers should confirm their flight status and rebooking options before travelling to the airport.Here is a breakdown of flights affected as of June 13:The Dubai-based low-cost carrier confirmed widespread disruptions and issued this official statement:“Due to the temporary closure of airspace over Iran and Israel in the early hours of 13 June, some flydubai flights have been impacted. Flights to Amman, Beirut, Damascus, Iran and Israel have been suspended and a number of flights have been cancelled, rerouted or have returned to their destination of origin.We are monitoring the situation in the region closely and adjusting our flight schedule accordingly. The safety of our passengers and crew remains our top priority. We are in direct contact with passengers whose travel plans have been affected.”Air Arabia has also suspended operations to and from a wide list of destinations, including:The Sharjah-based airline noted that other flights could also be delayed or rerouted. It issued the following advisory:“Passengers should check their flight status at airarabia.com or contact our call centre. Affected customers will be notified directly.”The ripple effects of the Israeli strikes and Iran's response have thrown regional aviation into turmoil:These closures have forced major international airlines to reroute flights mid-journey:The Dubai Airports authority urged travellers to arrive early, allow extra time for processing, and check with airlines directly before proceeding to the airport.“Guest ambassador teams are on hand across all terminals to assist affected passengers,” the authority added, thanking travellers for their patience.Friday’s strikes mark a dramatic escalation in the shadow war between Israel and Iran. According to initial reports, the Israeli military executed Operation Rising Lion, targeting strategic Iranian infrastructure, including:Iran later confirmed damage to a nuclear facility but reported no casualties. However, several senior military figures were said to be killed in the operation.Countries across the region immediately responded by shutting down airspaces, fearing retaliatory action and broader conflict spillover.In light of the evolving airspace closures and ongoing flight disruptions across the Middle East, UAE airport authorities and airlines have issued the following guidance for all affected or potentially affected travellers:Passengers are strongly urged to verify the latest status of their flights directly through official airline websites, mobile apps, or customer service hotlines. Third-party sources, including travel aggregators and booking platforms, may not reflect real-time updates or operational changes.Due to the increased congestion and potential schedule changes, travellers should arrive well in advance of their scheduled departure times. Early arrival will help accommodate any additional time required for check-in, security clearance, and gate reassignments.All UAE-based airlines, including Emirates, Etihad, flydubai, and Air Arabia, have activated customer support services for passengers affected by cancellations or delays. Rebooking options, refunds, and itinerary changes are being facilitated, and affected passengers are being contacted directly where possible.Dubai Airports confirmed that guest ambassador teams are on hand across all terminals at both Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC). These teams are assisting impacted passengers with navigation, information, rebooking, and general travel support.As the situation remains dynamic and may shift with little notice, passengers are advised to monitor announcements from their airlines and airport authorities. All stakeholders are coordinating closely to manage the impact and will provide further updates as developments unfold.","Emirates, Etihad, Flydubai and Air Arabia Announce Sweeping Disruptions.

Growing Middle East tensions





The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA has condemned Iran for being in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost two decades, diplomatic sources have said.The agency's 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution to that effect on Thursday, they said.They said the motion, drafted by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, was carried by 19 votes in favour. Russia, China and Burkina Faso opposed the motion, 11 abstained and two nations of the 35 did not vote.Iran responded defiantly to the resolution by announcing it would open a new enrichment site and upgrade centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility.""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran said in a joint statement.The IAEA board ""Finds that Iran's many failures to uphold its obligations since 2019 to provide the Agency with full and timely cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple undeclared locations in Iran ... constitutes non-compliance with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with the Agency,"" the resolution text, seen by Reuters news agency, said.Thursday's move could lead to further tensions between the West and Iran over its nuclear program and pave the way for United Nations sanctions on Tehran to be restored later this year.The resolution by the IAEA comes after Iran failed to give the agency credible explanations for the presence of uranium traces at undeclared sites in the country.The report by the agency at the end of May found that three of the four locations ""were part of an undeclared structured nuclear program carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material.""US intelligence services and the IAEA have suspected for some time that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program it halted in 2003.Iran has gradually been abandoning the commitments it made under the nuclear deal it agreed with world powers in 2015.That deal, which collapsed after the US withdrew from it in 2018 during US President Donald Trump's first term, lifted some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear program.The IAEA resolution comes as tensions in the region have been rising.The US State Department announced on Wednesday that it was pulling out people whom it considered non-essential to its operations in the Middle East.Staff reductions are being carried out at the US Embassy, and there are reports that personnel are also being moved from Kuwait and Bahrain over security concernsPresident Donald Trump has also warned that Israel or the US could carry out airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if ongoing US-Iran negotiations failed.Iran in its turn has responded with threats to hit US bases in the region if the US takes military action.Israel, Iran's regional archenemy, has meanwhile said the world must respond ""decisively"" to Iran's non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.",UN nuclear watchdog IAEA condemns Iran for being in breach of its non- proliferation obligations.

When were Iran and Israel allies?

When did Israeli-Iranian relations change?

Should Iran change its anti-Israel stance?

This article was originally written in German and published in April 2024. It was updated on June 13, 2025, following the Israeli attack on Iran.





Iran and Israel have been enemies for the past few decades with Iran saying it wants to wipe Israel off the map and threatening to annihilate it. Israel, for its part, regards Iran as its biggest adversary.But this wasn't always the case.In fact, Israel and Iran were allies until Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran was one of the first states to recognise Israel after it was founded in 1948. Israel regarded Iran as an ally against the Arab states. Iran, meanwhile, welcomed US-backed Israel as a counterweight to the region's Arab countries.Back then, Israel trained Iranian agricultural experts, supplied technical know-how and helped build up and train the Iranian armed forces. The Iranian shah paid Israel in oil, as its burgeoning economy was in need of fuel. Not only that. Iran was home to the second-largest Jewish community outside of Israel. Yet, after the Islamic Revolution, many Jews left the country. That said, even today, more than 20,000 Jews still live in Iran.Also read: Tensions soar: Why did Israel strike Iran? What makes the timing crucial – Explained After the Iranian Islamic Revolution brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his religious revolutionaries to power, Iran scrapped all previous agreements with Israel.Khomeini directed fierce criticism at Israel for its occupation of Palestinian territories.Gradually, Iran adopted an increasingly harsh rhetoric toward Israel with the aim of winning the favour of regional Arab states, or their citizens at the very least. The Iranian regime, after all, was eager to grow its regional influence.When Israel sent troops into southern Lebanon in 1982 to intervene in the country's civil war, Khomeini dispatched Iranian Revolutionary Guards to the Lebanese capital, Beirut, to support local Shiite militias. The Hezbollah militia, which grew out of this support, is today regarded as a direct Iranian proxy in Lebanon. Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters, remains just as antagonistic toward Israel as his predecessors. Khamenei and the entire Iranian leadership have also repeatedly questioned and denied the Holocaust.Not all ordinary Iranians support Iran's hostility toward Israel.""Iran must reassess its relationship with Israel because its stance is no longer in keeping with the times,"" said Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani, the daughter of former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, in a 2021 interview. Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani, who once held a seat in Iran's parliament, said Muslim Uyghurs are oppressed in China and Chechen Muslims in Russia — and yet ""Iran has close relations with both. ""Prominent political scientist Sadegh Zibakalam has repeatedly criticised Iran's policy toward Israel. ""This stance has isolated the country on the international stage,"" Zibakalam said in a 2022 interview with DW.Staunch backers of Iran's Islamic Republic, however, support the country's hostile position against Israel and are keen to see it oppose the great powers.Some Iranian regime supporters and members of the so-called Axis of Resistance have been irritated by Iran's long reluctance to attack Israel in the context of the Gaza war or avenge attacks on Iran itself, analyst Ali Fathollah-Nejad said in April 2024. The director of the Berlin-based Center for Middle East and Global Order think tank explained that frustration was growing over ""Iran's lack of credibility as the main champion of the Palestinian cause and its hesitance to confront Israel directly. ""","Iran was one of the first states to recognise Israel after it was founded in 1948. Iran welcomed US-backed Israel as a counterweight to the region's Arab countries. After the Iranian Islamic Revolution brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his religious revolutionaries to power, Iran scrapped all previous agreements with Israel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121825091,imgsize-262152,width-400,resizemode-4/121825091.jpg"

I know that they are doing that and I think that is now the first order of the day,"" Rutte told reporters at a press conference in Stockholm.""This was a unilateral action by Israel,"" Rutte said, speaking alongside Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, while noting it was ""obviously a rapidly evolving situation"".Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Israel it faced a ""bitter and painful"" fate over the attacks, which killed the country's armed forces' chief of staff, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and top nuclear scientists.The Israeli military said later that Iran launched 100 drones towards Israel in response and that its air defences were intercepting them outside Israeli territory.Kristersson said it was already a ""very serious and tense situation in the Middle East.""What is now happening in an unstable region, risks making things considerably worse,"" the prime minister said.Kristersson added that there was ""a very broad consensus that Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons,"" but said the issue needed to be brought back to the ""negotiating table"".""This could further increase the risk of terrorist threats and other dangerous activities,"" Kristersson said.","Israel struck some 100 targets in Iran, including Tehran's nuclear and military sites.

Israel's overnight ""preemptive strikes"" on Iran early Friday have led to major disruptions in international air traffic across the Middle East, as commercial airlines quickly diverted routes to avoid the affected region.The strikes, which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, missile infrastructure, and key military personnel, marked one of the most intense escalations between the two longtime adversaries in decades.As air-raid sirens sounded in parts of Israel and explosions were reported near Tehran, real-time data from flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed a rapid clearance of civilian aircraft from the region’s skies.A time-lapse video circulated online illustrating how aircraft were forced to abandon Middle East airspace as the Israeli operation commenced.The disruption is expected to have a ripple effect on international aviation, with longer flight durations, rerouted paths, and increased fuel costs likely for carriers operating across the Middle East and Asia.Emirates airline confirmed that multiple flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iran had been cancelled.The airline’s website listed cancellations for several Friday flights, as well as a Tehran-bound flight scheduled for Saturday.Dubai International Airport, one of the world's busiest aviation hubs, issued a statement acknowledging delays and cancellations at both DXB and DWC, Al Maktoum International, citing ""airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria.""The Israeli strikes conducted under, Operation Rising Lion hit multiple strategic sites across Iran, including its main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz. Black smoke was seen rising from the area, and Iranian state media confirmed damage at multiple locations. Two senior Iranian military commanders were reported killed in the strikes, according to regional sources.In response, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed ""severe punishment,"" warning Israel of impending retaliation.Hours later, the Israeli military said it had begun intercepting Iranian drones launched in reprisal, though these interceptions were taking place outside of Israeli airspace. Details of the counterattacks remain limited.The attack represents the most serious military confrontation Iran has faced since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and heightens fears of a broader regional conflict, especially with Tehran’s nuclear program continuing to advance despite years of international pressure.Global airlines are now bracing for further disruptions, while diplomatic channels remain tense.The United States has publicly denied involvement in the Israeli strike, though President Donald Trump has acknowledged receiving advance notice.","Israel's overnight ""preemptive strikes"" on Iran have led to major disruptions in international air traffic.

World leaders reacted swiftly on Friday to Israel’s military operation against Iran, launched late Thursday night with explosions reported in the capital, Tehran.Iran’s state-run news agency confirmed the blasts, while Israel’s defense minister described the attacks as ""preemptive strikes.""The strikes come amid rising tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear activities. Just hours before the operation, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors issued its first formal censure of Iran in 20 years. In response, Tehran announced plans to construct a third enrichment facility and upgrade its centrifuge technology. While Israel has long accused Iran of secretly pursuing nuclear weapons, Tehran denies the allegations.The international response has been swift, with several nations calling for restraint and emphasizing the risks of further escalation in the region.In a video statement, Netanyahu said, ""Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.""“This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.""“We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program, Iran's nuclear weaponization program, Iran's main enrichment facilities, leading nuclear scientists, and ballistic missile programs,” he added.Issuing a clear statement distancing the US from the Israeli action, he said, “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.”""Australia is alarmed by the escalation between Israel and Iran. This risks further destabilising a region that is already volatile. We call on all parties to refrain from actions and rhetoric that will further exacerbate tensions.”""We all understand the threat of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program represents a threat to international peace and security, and we urge the parties to prioritize dialogue and diplomacy.”""It's a really unwelcome development in the Middle East. The risk of miscalculation is high.

UK: Three British Hindus beaten up in London park in racially motivated attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-three-british-hindus-beaten-up-in-london-park-in-racially-motivated-attack/articleshow/121840323.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only





LONDON: Three British Hindu men were asked their ethnicity in a London park and, when they replied they were Indian and Sri Lankan, were viciously beaten up in an unprovoked attack by three older men who appeared to be Muslim, it has emerged.Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious; all had to go to Northwick Park Hospital. They have all been left with cuts and bruises and two have been left with facial fractures. Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the case in the House of Commons on Thursday, describing it as “religious hatred.”TOI has now tracked down the sister of one of the men, a British Indian Gujarati Hindu, aged 20, a first-year university student studying radiography. It turns out he had gone to Harrow Recreation Ground with two friends on May 30 to play cricket. The friends are British Hindus of Sri Lankan descent, aged 20 and 21.The three of them went to a shop at 6 pm, walking past a café where a group of around eight people were seated. It appeared to be a Muslim family, with some of the women wearing hijabs. They looked back at their other friends playing cricket when one of the men outside the café got up and confronted the three Hindus and asked them why they were looking at his family, his sister told TOI.They replied that they were not looking at his family and were looking at friends playing cricket. Then a slightly older man from the café group came over and asked: “What is your problem? Why are you talking to my brother?” The three men tried to defuse the situation and the two men seemed to accept their answer.They went back to the park and sat on a bench.Around 30 minutes later, three men from the cafe group, in their mid to late 20s, came over and became very aggressive, asking, “Where are you from? Are you Sri Lankan? Are you Indian?”To which one of the Sri Lankan-origin men replied: ”Yes, we are.”The three men then beat them up relentlessly, punching and kicking them until the British Indian and his friend were left lying unconscious on the ground, the sister said.“My brother was wearing a sacred thread from a mandir on his wrist,” the sister said.One of the attackers was wearing a Moroccan football T-shirt with the number 2 and the word “Hakimi”.Police and ambulances arrived and the British Indian was taken to the hospital. The other two had to make their own way there.“My brother is struggling. He feels as if people are looking at him and is ashamed to step out of the house. He has never been involved in a fight before,” the sister told TOI on Friday.“He has just done his first-year exams and was meant to resume his two-week clinical placement the week after the attack and that has been put on hold.” She also said she was unhappy with how the police investigation was progressing, as two weeks later, they still had not examined CCTV footage.The Met Police told TOI they were called to deal with a “fight” and one man was taken to hospital “with a head injury”. “There is no evidence at this time that this attack was racially motivated. Our enquiries into the circumstances continue. No arrests have been made,” a spokesperson said.",Three British Hindu men were viciously beaten up in a London park. Three older men who appeared to be Muslim attacked them. Two of the men suffered blows to the head and were left unconscious.

Starmer Slams Badenoch For 'Echoing Kremlin Talk' In Heated UK Parliament Clash

Daily attacks:

Sophisticated challenge:





LONDON: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it was set to unveil Monday a major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression and the changing nature of warfare.Prime Minister Keir Starmer told BBC radio that ""there is greater instability on defence and security than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.""His Labour government will later publish its Strategic Defence Review, a document that will assess threats facing the UK and make recommendations.The review warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported over the weekend.""I wanted a review that told me the challenges we're actually facing and likely to face for the foreseeable future,"" Starmer told the BBC Monday.""And the principles are clear: war-fighting readiness, integrating our forces... and a Nato first approach,"" he added.The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.Starmer said it would serve as ""a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come"".His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 in the ""largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War"".And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three per cent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029.The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.Based on the recommendations of the review, which is led by former Nato secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.This includes £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"", procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending £6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its Aukus military alliance with Australia and the United States, and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme.The defence ministry last week pledged £1 billion for the creation of a ""cyber command"" to help on the battlefield.""We're in a world that is changing now... and it is a world of growing threats,"" defence secretary John Healey told the BBC in an interview Sunday.""It's growing Russian aggression. It's those daily cyberattacks, it's new nuclear risks, and it's increasing tension in other parts of the world as well,"" he said.The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a ""deadly quartet"".But in an op-ed in The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that ""The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.""The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government's efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative government.The review describes Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat, but calls China a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", according to The Guardian.At a time when Washington is demanding that its Nato allies bolster their own defences, Britain is considering strengthening its deterrent by buying nuclear-missile capable aircrafts from the United States, The Sunday Times reported.Without confirming or denying, Healey said Sunday that ""strong deterrence is absolutely essential in order to keep Britain and the British people safe"".","UK to unveil major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression.
