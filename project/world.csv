"Man gets triple-death sentence for rape, murder of 5-year-old in Nagpur",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-gets-triple-death-sentence-for-rape-murder-of-5-year-old-in-nagpur/articleshow/110677979.cms,"NAGPUR: A sessions court in Maharashtra’s Nagpur pronounced on Monday triple death sentences to a man convicted on three counts of abduction, rape and murder of a five-year-old girl in 2019.Additional sessions judge S R Padwal’s verdict against Sanjay Puri under Sections 302 (murder) and 376AB (rape of a minor) of IPC and Section 6 of Pocso Act (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) is said to be the first instance of a court in Maharashtra giving three death sentences.Double death sentences have previously been pronounced in at least four cases in the Vidarbha region alone.“The death penalty will be executed, subject to confirmation by Bombay high court.

It transpired that he lured the child into a field the day she went missing, gagged, raped and then murdered her.Additional sessions judge Padwal also fined the convict Rs 15,000 and directed the officer-in-charge of Kalmeshwar police station to assist the victim’s parents in applying for compensation from the State Legal Aid Committee.The most recent double death sentence was pronounced on May 22 by another court in Nagpur against a man convicted of raping and killing his 16-year-old daughter.

"Biden takes a big swing at hostage-for-truce deal, puts onus on Israeli, Hamas officials to step up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-takes-a-big-swing-at-hostage-for-truce-deal-puts-onus-on-israeli-hamas-officials-to-step-up/articleshow/110684865.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is looking past resistance from key Israeli officials as he presses Israel and Hamas to agree to a three-phase agreement that could immediately bring home dozens of Israeli hostages, free Palestinian prisoners and perhaps even lead to an endgame in the nearly eight-month-old Gaza war.Biden's big swing - during a tough reelection battle - could also demonstrate to a significant slice of his political base demoralized by his handling of the conflict that he's doing his part to end the war that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands struggling to meet basic needs.White House officials on Monday said Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal - just one day after it was delivered to Hamas - was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot. The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.""The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.Almost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal - which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.Netanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain ""gaps"" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis ""reserve the right to return to war.""Kirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he ""expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.""""This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,"" Kirby said. ""This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.""But even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition - National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.Smotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is ""the only language understood in the Middle East.""Netanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages - officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others - to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.Even as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.""They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,"" Sullivan said in an appearance at the US Global Leadership Conference in Washington.To that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was ""the best possible opportunity for an agreement,"" the White House said.Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the United Nations, said the US circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.Sullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.Group of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.""We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,"" the G7 leaders said in a statement.Biden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.The first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.The Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.Hamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one - and the six-week pause in fighting - would bring about a ""downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.""""I'm not sure they can expect much more,"" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.""Indeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.Just last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.But with Election Day in the US now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.",White House officials say Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot. The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.

But Farage said he changed his mind because he felt guilty not standing up for people who had become disillusioned with politics and had always backed him.“We are going to be the voice of opposition, and I tell you what, I have done it before, I’ll do it again, I’ll surprise everybody,” Farage told a news conference, saying it was a fait accompli that Labour would win but he wanted to position Reform as its main opponent. He said he would lead a “political revolt” in Britain because “nothing in this country works anymore”, citing problems with public services such as healthcare and roads.Although Farage has stood unsuccessfully for parliament seven times he is still one of the most influential British politicians of his generation, putting pressure on a succession of PMs to take tougher positions on the EU and on tackling immigration. Farage has previously made comments that his political opponents have called racist. Farage appeared in front of a poster during the Brexit campaign showing lines of migrants under the slogan “Breaking Point” and last month said Muslims did not share British values.","Farage, 60, had previously said he would not stand in the July 4 vote in order to help Donald Trump fight the US election later this year.

BEIJING: China has alleged that the British Secret Intelligence Service MI6 turned two staff members of unnamed Chinese central state organs into spies for the British govt, its state security ministry said in a statement on Monday. The ministry said the case against the two spies, a married couple, is under further investigation.

In its statement, the Chinese ministry said the spy with the surname Wang studied in the UK in 2015 under an exchange programme and had been invited to dinners and tours surreptitiously arranged by the MI6 during that period. Wang was said to have “a strong desire for money” and was lured into a part-time consulting opportunity with high remuneration before MI6 personnel approached him to work to serve the British gov t with promises of even bigger monetary rewards, as well as security. He agreed.

After espionage training , MI6 commanded Wang to return to China to collect important information related to the Chinese govt. The ministry said MI6 also persuaded Wang to turn his wife, who worked at a “core government unit”, for double the money. The wife, surnamed Zhou, eventually agreed.",China has accused the British Secret Intelligence Service MI6 of recruiting two employees from undisclosed Chinese central state organs to work as spies for the British government.

Hunter Biden’s criminal trial begins in aftermath of Trump conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-bidens-criminal-trial-begins-in-aftermath-of-trump-conviction/articleshow/110684296.cms,"WASHINGTON: The criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicked off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as Prez Joe Biden’s son faces gun charges in ahistoric case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former US president to be convicted.Hunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018. He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California. First Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US district Judge Maryellen Noreika. “Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House.Hunter’s trial gives Republicans a chance to shift atten-tion away from Trump’s legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.In the case brought by US special counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last Sept Hunter was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in Oct 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter faces up to 25 years in jail, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the justice department.Noreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving length of the trial, likely to run through end of next week.","Hunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president.

Claudia Sheinbaum elected Mexico’s first woman president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/claudia-sheinbaum-elected-mexicos-first-woman-president/articleshow/110684051.cms,"MEXICO CITY: Claudia Sheinbaum , a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won her nation’s elections Sunday in a landslide victory that brought a huge milestone: She became the first woman to be elected prez of Mexico. Early results indicated that Sheinbaum, 61, prevailed in what the authorities called the largest in Mexico’s history, with the highest number of voters taking part and the most seats up for grabs. It was a landmark vote that saw not one, but two, women vying to lead one of the hemisphere’s biggest nations.Sheinbaum, a leftist, campaigned on a vow to continue the legacy of Mexico’s current prez and her mentor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador . The election was seen by many as a referendum on his leadership, and her victory was a clear vote of confidence in him and the party he started.Lopez Obrador has completely reshaped Mexican politics. During his tenure, millions of Mexicans were lifted out of poverty and the minimum wage doubled. But he has also been a deeply polarising prez, criticised for failing to control rampant cartel violence, for hobbling the nation’s health system and for persistently undercutting democratic institutions. Still, Lopez Obrador remains widely popular and his enduring appeal propelled his chosen successor.With about 78% of votes counted, Sheinbaum had some 59% of votes, about twice as many as her nearest competitor Xachitl Galvez. Galvez, an entrepreneur and ex-senator on a ticket with a coalition of opposition parties, got aro und 28%. Longshot candidate Jorge alvarez Maynez trailed with 10.5% of the vote. Sheinbaum’s Morena party was also projected to hold majority in both chambers of Congress. Speaking to supporters, Sheinbaum vowed to work on behalf of all Mexicans, reaffirmed her party’s commitment to democracy and celebrated her groundbreaking ascension to the nation’s highest office. “For the first time in 200 years of the republic, I will become the first female presi dent of Mexico,” she said.Sheinbaum’s experience is ample: She has a doctorate in energy engineering, participated in a UN panel of climate scientists awarded a Nobel Peace Prize and governed the capital. Known as a demanding boss with a reserved demeanor, she has risen through ranks by aligning herself completely with Lopez Obrador. As a result, the prez-elect battled the perception among many that she will be little more than a pawn of her mentor.Another milestone: She’s 1ˢᵗ Jewish presidentMexico elected its first Jewish president over the weekend, a remarkable step in a country with one of the world’s largest Catholic populations. Sheinbaum, 61, rarely discusses her heritage. When she does, she tends to convey a more distant relationship to Mexico’s Jewish community, which stretches back to the origins of Mexico itself, and today numbers about 59,000 in a country of 130 million people.“Of course I know where I come from, but my parents were atheists,” she said in 2020. Her parents were both leftists and involved in the sciences. But while Sheinbaum has downplayed her ties to Judaism, her origins have not gone entirely unnoticeds. After emerging last year as a prez contender, Sheinbaum faced “birther” attacks questioning whether she was born in Mexico or is even Mexican.Since the Gaza war there broke out last year, Sheinbaum has condemned attacks on civilians, called for a ceasefire and said she supports a two-state solution. It remains to be seen how, as president, she will navigate Mexico’s position on the war, an increasingly contentious issue in the country.","Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won her nation’s elections Sunday in a landslide victory.

Gaza truce plan in doubt as 'Bibi calls Biden's proposal partial',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gaza-truce-plan-in-doubt-as-bibi-calls-bidens-proposal-partial/articleshow/110683954.cms,"US Prez Joe Biden’s proposal for a ceasefire and hostage-release deal to end the war in Gaza was only part of the full package, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said.

Israel is willing to pause hostilities for the purpose of returning hostages but what happens next will be subject to further talks, Netanyahu said in a meeting with parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committee on Monday, according to a spokesman for his office. There are other details that the US prez did not present to the public, he said, without being more specific. “The outline that Prez Biden presented is partial,” spokesman David Mencer quoted the PM as saying. Netanyahu, in a separate statement issued by his office, said “claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect”.

His comments raise further questions about the three phase peace plan laid out by Biden, which he said had been put forward by Israel. That proposal detailed a six-week truce involving an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, followed by focus on an Israeli withdrawal of troops and permanent ceasefire. Netanyahu was quick to push back against the idea he’s on board with that plan, saying the destruc tion of Hamasremains a nonnegotiable target. The Israeli PM is under pressure from far right allies who have threatened to leave his governing coalition and bring down the govt if he agrees to end the war without dismantling Hamas .

The PM’s far-right coalition partners, party leaders national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, both slammed the latest plan on Monday. Ben Gvir said the “whitewashed” proposal laid out by Biden would mean “the end of the war without achieving the objective that the cabinet clearly set: the destruction of Hamas”. If Netanyahu would “sign on an irresponsible deal”, Ben Gvir said his party “will break up the govt”. Smotrich said: “If, heaven forbid, the government decides to adopt this proposal of surrender, we will not be part of it and we will act to replace the failed leadership with new leadership.”

If the right-wing lawmakers depart the govt, it could force the fall of Netanyahu’s coalition. Opposition politician Yair Lapid, a centrist ex-PM, has said the govt “can’t ignore Biden’s important speech”, vowing to back Netanyahu if his far-right coalition partners quit. Hamas on Friday said it viewed Biden’s outline “positively”, but since has made no official comment on the stalled negotiations, while mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have not announced any new round of talks.","US Prez Joe Biden’s proposal for a ceasefire and hostage-release deal to end the war in Gaza was only part of the full package, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said. “The outline that Prez Biden presented is partial,” spokesman David Mencer quoted the PM as saying.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110683961,imgsize-1341275,width-400,resizemode-4/110683961.jpg"

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible. The uploads also included pictures of the current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110645668,imgsize-670816,width-400,resizemode-4/110645668.jpg"

White bike installations pop up across New York as reminder of road safety,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-bike-installations-pop-up-across-new-york-as-reminder-of-road-safety/articleshow/110684638.cms,"On a chilly Saturday evening in April, Kevin Daloia took a bicycle that he had painted white and locked it to a pole on East 161st Street and Melrose Avenue in the Bronx. Then he climbed up, stood on the seat of the bike and mounted a metal sign on the pole above it. “Cyclist Killed Here/Rest In Peace,” the sign said.The cyclist , Thierno Balde, was hit by a car on Feb 23 while on his way home from prayers at his mosque. The driver fled after the crash and then ditched a crumpled Jeep Grand Cherokee a few blocks away, according to repo rts. The police said Balde had run a red light. But the authorities also said the driver had been speeding. Daloia didn’t know Balde, but that didn’t matter.In his free time, Daloia volunteers to paint old bicycles and fasten them to poles as “ghost bikes” for the New York City Street Memorial Project, which consists of installations around the city marking locations where cyclists have died. The bikes — completely white, including tires, spokes and pedals — serve as stark memorials, both an alert to passers-by that a cyclist was killed and a re minder of the dangerous conditions cyclists face in New York. The activistshope to catch the attention of drivers as well.Daloia isn’t sure how many, exactly, he has erected. “I’ve done this for a long time,” he said. “Anything in the Bronx I’ve touched, and I’ve touched a lot more throughout the city. I don’t know the number, man. Probably 20, 25?” Last year was the deadliest for cyclists in New York since 1999. Thirty cyclists were killed in 2023, according to the city’s department of transportation. Of those, 23 were riding e-bikes. Most fatalities oc curred in collisions with cars and trucks — on streets that did not have dedicated bike lanes.In New York, a group of artists called Visual Resistance first put up ghost bikes in 2005 in response to a couple of cyclist deaths. “It was supposed to speak more powerfully than words,” said Leah Todd, another volunteer. “A silent but very communicative memorial.” The idea caught on and continues to gain momentum. “We had some grand idea and hope that people would want to care — and want to limit these deaths.”Ghost bike volunteers recei ve donated bicycles from bike shops, friends or word of mouth. They remove a few essential parts from each bike, rendering it un-ridable and therefore less likely to be stolen. Although cyclist fatalities are usually caused by car crashes, the volunteers who install ghost bikes are not necessarily anti-car. Daloia describes himself as “a cycling traffic safety advocate who starts his car every day”. He believes cars, people and bicycles should be able to coexist peacefully. “I want some of the roads around here to be safer for pedestrians and cyclists.”","Last year was the deadliest for cyclists in New York since 1999.

'Vicious' atmosphere

LONDON: Stormy Daniels , the adult film actor, broke her silence after former US president Donald Trump 's conviction to say he should be jailed, in an interview published in British tabloid The Mirror at the weekend.""I think he should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate, or being the volunteer punching bag at a women's shelter,"" Daniels said in the interview, published late on Saturday.A jury of 12 New Yorkers on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts of business fraud for trying to cover up hush money payments to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election .Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 to keep silent and prevent scandal from breaking ahead of the election, in which Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton After years of exchanging insults with Trump on social media, Daniels now says she finally has been ""vindicated"", although she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury made a decision -- one that made Trump the first ever former US president to be convicted of a crime.Daniels also accused the White House hopeful of being ""completely and utterly out of touch with reality"" and compared him to a child at one point in the interview.The former adult film actor and director helped bring Trump down in court with her gripping testimony, which included graphic descriptions of what she says was a casual sexual encounter in 2006.""Being in court was so intimidating with the jurors looking at you,"" she said in the Mirror interview, adding that she was glad it was proved that she had been ""telling the truth the entire time"".""It's not over for me. It's never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.""The 45-year-old had remained uncharacteristically quiet in the days following the Thursday conviction.Daniels's husband Barrett Blade had previously told CNN that she was ""still processing"" the trial. He suggested that she could be threatened by Trump 's supporters.""You know, all the MAGA idiots are going to be coming after her,"" Blade said, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again movement.Daniels also said she would never escape death threats from Trump's supporters, the Mirror reported.""It's so vicious and threatening... from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do,"" Daniels's lawyer Clark Brewster said of the atmosphere around the trial in an interview with a local ABC News channel.Daniels is a self-made woman who rose from a difficult childhood and through the challenging world of adult movies to become a successful businesswoman.But in a recent documentary, she revealed that behind her outwardly tough, humorous persona on social media, she has been hurt by the constant insults from Trump and his supporters.""Back in 2018 that was stuff like 'liar', 'slut', 'gold digger',"" she said in the film, ""Stormy"".""This time around, it is very different. It is direct threats, it is, 'I'm going to come to your house and slit your throat', 'your daughter should be euthanised'.""The trial and its revelations have added to tensions in the already bitterly divided country.On Friday, Trump launched into a stream of insults and non-factual claims, lashing out that the trial and the judge who presided over it.His campaign on Friday said that it had raised nearly $53 million in online donations after the conviction, boasting that the verdict had boosted his support ""like never before"".Trump is due for sentencing on July 11 but is expected to appeal the verdict.

Dark plumes of smoke traveled high into the sky over the fire area comprised mostly of grassy hills.Early Sunday, the blaze appeared to be growing, fueled by hot and dry conditions in California. Cal Fire updated the size of the fire to 19.5 square miles (50.5 square kilometers), up from 17.2 square miles (44.5 square kilometers) late Saturday.The fire was 15 percent contained as of Sunday morning, the Cal Fire Santa Clara Unit said in a Facebook post that strong winds and dry grass ""have made it difficult for firefighters to contain.""Chief Baraka Carter said two fire workers were injured, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.Interstate 580, which connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin County in central California, was closed from the Alameda County line to the Stanislaus County Line. SR 132 was also closed from I-580 to SR 33 due to the wildfire, the California Department of Transportation said in a statement.The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services issued an evacuation order for areas west of the California Aqueduct, south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to Alameda County and south to Stanislaus County. A temporary evacuation point was established at Larch Clover Community Center in Tracy.Sunday's high temperature for Tracy was expected to reach 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), with no rain in the forecast, but hotter conditions are on their way.The National Weather Service said ""dangerously hot conditions"" with highs of 103 F to 108 F (39.4 C to 42.2 C) were expected later in the week for San Joaquin Valley, an area that encompasses the city of Tracy. Wind gusts of up to 45 mph (72 kph) lashed the region Saturday night, according to meteorologist Idamis Shoemaker of the NWS Sacramento.The wildfire was near the Lawrence Livermore laboratory's Site 300 southwest of Tracy, Cal Fire said in a social media post late Saturday.Lawrence Livermore is a research and development institution primarily focusing on the US nuclear weapons stockpile.

The parade in the past was dubbed ""Celebrate Israel,"" but organizers said the exuberant atmosphere would be paused this year given the war and Israeli hostages still being held in captivity, as well as outbursts of antisemitism worldwide.People chanted ""Bring them home now!"" and waved Israeli flags as they marched along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Crowds of spectators lined the route of what this year is being called ""Israel Day on Fifth.""Mark Treyger, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council, said earlier this week that the event would focus on solidarity, strength and resilience.""This is not a mood of confetti and music,"" Treyger said. ""This is more of a mood of unwavering, ironclad solidarity with hostages to bring them home, and also our unwavering love and pride in our Jewish identity.""The parade, which is in its 59th year, kicked off at about 11:30 a.m. Sunday and was expected to draw more than 40,000 participants, including Israeli dignitaries, celebrities and some of the hostages' families.There was never a thought of canceling the parade this year, Treyger said, despite what he termed an astronomical rise in antisemitism.""This is a moment that we have to meet,"" he said.But there was significant security.New York Police Department officials said Friday they plan to implement measures typically used for high-profile events such as New Year's Eve and July 4. That includes drones, K-9 units, bike patrols, fencing and barriers and designated entry points for spectators all along the parade route.Backpacks, large bags and coolers will be prohibited. Spectators will have to pass through metal detectors and only be allowed to line the east side of Fifth Avenue, with police blocking off the west side.City officials stressed Friday there were no specific or credible threats to either the parade or the city and any protestors have the right to demonstrate so long as its done peacefully.""We're not going to allow any unlawfulness and any disruption of any celebration of one's heritage in this city,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a security briefing.The parade represents the first large-scale Jewish event in the city since the war started, although there have been roughly 2,800 protests in the city, with about 1,300 of them related to the conflict, the Democrat said.Israel faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.","The parade comes almost eight months after the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

""I think it'd be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there's a breaking point.""Trump did not elaborate on what he thought might happen if that point is reached. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11, four days before Republicans gather to formally choose their presidential nominee to face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.Asked what Trump supporters should do if he were jailed, Republic National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump told CNN: ""Well, they're gonna do what they've done from the beginning, which is remain calm and protest at the ballot box on November 5th. There's nothing to do other than make your voices heard loud and clear and speak out against this.""Trump has used his conviction to step up his fundraising efforts but has not otherwise sought to mobilize his supporters, in contrast to his comments protesting his 2020 loss to Biden that were followed by an attack by his supporters on January 6, 2021 on the US Capitol.The RNC and the Trump campaign raised $70 million in the 48 hours after the verdict, Lara Trump said, a figure that Reuters was not able to independently verify. Asked how much would be used to pay legal fees versus running the campaign, she declined to say.At least one Democratic lawmaker expressed concern on Sunday about the potential for Trump's supporters to respond violently to his conviction.""His base listens to him. They don't listen to Lara Trump. And this is another dangerous appeal to violence,"" Democratic US Representative Adam Schiff told CNN.But US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, said any response must be lawful.""We are the rule of law party - chaos is not a conservative value. We have to fight back and we will with everything in our arsenal. But we do that within the confines of the rule of law,"" Johnson told ""Fox News Sunday.""Trump has vowed to appeal his conviction by the New York jury, which found him guilty of 34 felony counts over falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.The matter is unlikely to be resolved before the November presidential election, when he will seek to take back the White House from Biden. Opinion polls show a close race between the two men and suggest that his conviction could hurt him with some Republican voters and independents.Trump attorney Will Scharf told ABC News' ""This Week"" that he does not expect Trump to ""end up being subject to any sentence whatsoever"" and planned to ultimately take the case to the Supreme Court.Trump still faces three other criminal cases, although they are not likely to come to trial before the election. He denies wrongdoing in all the cases and has called the charges a Democratic conspiracy to prevent him from competing.Biden, meanwhile, has sought to defend the nation's justice system, saying it is ""reckless"" and ""dangerous"" to call the verdict ""rigged.""

NEW DELHI: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump quickly received a million followers on TikTok within hours of joining the platform on Sunday. As president, Trump had attempted to ban the short video social media platform on national security grounds.Trump's decision to join TikTok aims to reach younger voters in his third bid for the White House. He faces a close race with Democratic incumbent Joe Biden ahead of the November 5 presidential elections.Trump posted a launch video on his account @realdonaldtrump, on Saturday night. The video shows Trump greeting fans at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event in Newark, New Jersey.Biden's campaign is already active on TikTok eventhough Biden has signed a bill that would ban the app, used by 170 million Americans, if its Chinese owner ByteDance fails to divest it.ByteDance is challenging in court the law requiring it to sell TikTok by next January or face a ban. The White House seeks to end Chinese-based ownership on national security grounds. TikTok argues it will not share US user data with the Chinese government and has taken measures to protect user privacy.Trump's 2020 attempt to ban TikTok was blocked by the courts. In March, he called the platform a national security threat but said a ban would hurt young people and strengthen Meta Platforms' Facebook, which he has criticized.Trump has a significant social media presence with over 87 million followers on X and more than 7 million followers on his platform, Truth Social.Last week, a US appeals court established a fast-track schedule to review the legal challenges against the new law.

Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets.

Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges.

We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live. I still hope I can claim it back.""Others said they wanted payback.""I haven't joined the Arakan Army because I am worried about who will look after my child,"" one woman said.""If I wasn't...

Taliban government harbours big dreams for Afghan rail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-government-harbours-big-dreams-for-afghan-rail/articleshow/110558085.cms,"HAIRATAN: On the edge of the Afghan border with Uzbekistan, where the railway abruptly stops, throngs of young men transfer sacks of wheat or flour from freight trains to trucks.Every day, 3,500 tons of flour and 1,500 tons of wheat are unloaded by hand at the border town of Hairatan in northern Afghanistan to trucks that brave mountain passes and war-damaged roads to ferry goods around the country.Renovations are under way to connect the rundown track with Mazar-i-Sharif, the north's largest city, and according to the Taliban authorities, it will come into operation from June.Just 75 kilometres (47 miles) long, it is an important part of the Taliban government 's ambitions to revive several dormant railway projects .The long-envisioned Trans-Afghan Railway aims to eventually connect Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan with 700 kilometres of track, backed by the three countries that have established a working group.""People have been talking about the Trans-Afghan Railway for more than 100 years,"" said Andrew Grantham, news editor of the UK-based Railway Gazette International, a media outlet dedicated to covering developments in the rail sector.In addition to foodstuffs and logs from Russia, fuel and other materials arrive in Hairatan from Central Asian republics and China, with the Taliban government aspiring to see those goods traverse Afghanistan by rail under their rule.""Trans-Afghan will become the economic corridor between Central Asia and South Asia,"" said Mohammad Shafiq Mahmood, head of the Balkh railway authority in Mazar-i-Sharif.It is one of two railway projects the Taliban authorities are pursuing in a bid to better connect Afghanistan -- a country wracked by decades of war and poverty that has never built its own railways.A second line of more than 200 kilometres at the other end of the country is intended to connect the city of Herat with its western neighbour Iran, providing Afghanistan with an outlet to the sea, Turkey and Europe.This is a project envisaged for some 15 years, long before the Taliban's return to power in 2021.Railway transport is the fastest and cheapest means of transporting goods, with passenger trains not on the table at this stage in Afghanistan.- Billions of dollars -Building a line all the way through to Pakistan will take time, however, said Abdulsami Durrani, the national railway spokesperson in Kabul.""According to our current estimates, once the actual work on this project begins, the construction phase will take three to five years,"" he told AFP.He added preliminary figures suggest a price tag of $4-5 billion, though he remained vague about sources of funding.""We are in discussions with various countries and financial institutions,"" he said.Foreign funds have withered since the Taliban's return to power, their government not formally recognised by any country.""Building a railway on that scale in five years, it's not going to happen,"" said Grantham.""It's just too ambitious,"" he told AFP, emphasising that Kabul will need foreign financial and technical aid.Western companies will likely not be interested due to ""security and safety issues and the political environment"", he added.But Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, as well as Russia, are already working with Afghanistan.Other countries, such as Iran, could also provide support.- Access to the sea -""The projects do seem to be happening,"" said Grantham, noting that the line connecting Herat to Iran ""can be up and running reasonably quickly"".""Assuming Iran is supportive, that should be a viable project,"" he said.Last Sunday, work began on the final phase of this line.The 47-kilometre section will be built in two years for $53 million, with Russian and Turkish partners, said Durrani.This railway will give landlocked Afghanistan access to the sea and connect it with international trade routes, and will ""significantly impact Afghanistan's economy"", he added.""The more kilometres of railways are developed in the country, the more our trade with other countries will increase.""In addition to funding, there remain thorny technical issues to resolve, notably the track gauge.Iran uses European gauge standards, but the railways coming from the former Soviet republics have a different gauge, and Pakistan's have a third.""You can have hours of fun,"" working out which of the three gauges Afghanistan should use, said Grantham.","Taliban government wants to revive dormant railway projects in Afghanistan.
