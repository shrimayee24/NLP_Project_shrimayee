"Pakistan distances itself from ISI agent, says he is Canadian",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-distances-itself-from-isi-agent-says-he-is-canadian/articleshow/120185792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hours before Tahawwur Rana 's arrival, Pakistan washed its hands off him saying he had ceased to be Pakistani and was a Canadian.Distancing itself from Rana, whom the ISI protected till the end, Pakistan govt's foreign office issued a statement Thursday saying they had no connection to him. ""He is a Canadian national and as per our record, he has not renewed his Pakistani documents for over two decades,"" its spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said at a briefing.The strenuous distancing is significant because the involvement of Pakistan's spy agency ISI was established by Indian agencies with the help of the confession of Ajmal Kasab , the lone Lashkar terrorist involved in the carnage to have been apprehended alive, and findings of the investigation conducted with help from foreign partners; especially the FBI.Rana, born in Pakistan in 1961, served in the Pakistan Army Medical Corps before moving to Canada in the 1990s, where he obtained citizenship. Sources in the intelligence establishment have consistently maintained that this was a routine move by the ISI to 'settle' their assets abroad to facilitate their India-centric operations.Denial has been the default first response of Pakistan govt which faced international opprobrium after the mass slaughter of innocents carried out by its assets, and which further steeled its already-formidable notoriety as the hub of jihadi terror. It had denied Kasab was a Pakistani citizen, going to the extent of identifying him as an Indian national - something which could have helped its effort to pass off the Mumbai attack as a case of homegrown terror. Kasab and others were carrying forged IDs which showed them as Hindus. As part of the camouflage, they had tied saffron strings ('kalevas') they had found on the fishing trawlerthey had commandeered.Kasab's alias was that of a Bengaluru resident, Samir Dinesh Chaudhari. The gameplan came to naught because of the expose that confirmed his identity as a Pakistani national born to Amir Kasab and Noor Illahi - both Pakistan citizens. Then Pakistani PM Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani subsequently sacked his adviser on national security Mahmud Ali Durrani for his ""irresponsible behaviour"".","Tahawwur Rana was born in Pakistan in 1961.

'Govt will hang Tahawwur Rana during Bihar polls'

NEW DELHI: Who should take the credit for the successful extradition of Mumbai terror attacks accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana? Prime Minister Modi-led NDA government or the Congress-led UPA government? Ironically, even before the special flight carrying Rana from US to India had landed - the BJP and the Congress engaged in a bitter tussle to claim credit.BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla claimed Rana's extradition was a ""big achievement"" of the Modi government and its security agencies. ""This extradition is not an ordinary extradition. This is a reflection of new India's resolve which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had described in 2019, saying that if anyone dared to attack India's unity, integrity, respect and its innocent people, the new India would bring such terrorists to justice,"" Poonawalla said.The BJP spokesperson said Rana was being brought back to make him face justice due to a ""sea change"" in the ""attitude and mindset"" of the government under Modi towards terrorism and terror attacks.Union minister and BJP leader Piyush Goyal also joined the debate and said the Congress did not do anything to punish the terrorists and the extradition was possible because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “foremost and paramount commitment” to India’s national security and national interest.However, the Congress was quick to counter BJP's claim and asserted that the Modi government merely benefited from the consistent and strategic diplomacy that was begun under the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government (2004-2014).""Let the facts be clear: the Modi government did not initiate this process, nor did it secure any new breakthrough. It merely benefited from the mature, consistent, and strategic diplomacy begun under the UPA. This extradition is not the result of any grandstanding, it is a testament to what the Indian state can achieve when diplomacy, law enforcement, and international cooperation are pursued sincerely and without any kind of chest-thumping,"" senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said.The Congress leader traced the origins of the extradition efforts back to 2009 when the UPA government, under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, took a significant step by registering a case against Rana and his co-conspirator, David Coleman Headley, in New Delhi.Another Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar claimed that the extradition of Tahawwur Rana from the US was a ploy by the BJP to ""divert"" attention of the public from the “failure” of the central government to fulfill its promises.""Since the BJP has no achievement worth the name, it tries to divert public issues under one pretext or the other,"" Kanhaiya said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut gave an interesting twist to the debate as he claimed that the government will hang Tahawwur Hussain Rana during the Bihar elections due later this year.""Rana should be immediately hanged but he will be hanged during the Bihar polls (scheduled later this year),"" Raut told PTI. Raut said there was a 16-year-old battle to bring Rana to India and it started during the Congress rule. ""So no one should take the credit of bringing back Rana,"" Raut said.The Shiv Sena (UBT) leader also demanded that Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was captured in 2016 and was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged spying, be brought back home.While the NIA and other investigative agencies work round the clock to ensure that Rana is punished for his acts, political parties will continue to fight for credit to maximise their electoral gains. Perhaps the credit for this success should be given to the agencies that have worked over the years to bring Rana to India.","BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla claimed Rana's extradition was a ""big achievement"" of the Modi government and its security agencies.

Kanye West unleashes explosive social media rant targeting targets Taylor Swift

Kanye West sparked a fresh wave of controversy late Wednesday night after posting over 100 messages on X (formerly Twitter), touching on everything from his strained relationships with fellow celebrities to personal stories about his past. The posts, raw and often explicit, once again placed the rap mogul at the center of a media storm.Among the most notable moments from the barrage of posts was Kanye West’s unexpected apology directed toward longtime friend and collaborator JAY-Z. West addressed a past tweet in which he insulted the rapper’s children, saying: “I’m sorry JAY-Z. I be feeling bad about my tweet but I still feel I gave my life to this industry and thought so many people were my family but when I needed my family on some real shit none of these rap n-ggas had my back.”The apology, however, did little to temper the more controversial elements of the rant. One of the most shocking claims involved pop superstar Taylor Swift. West, who has a well-documented and tumultuous history with Swift dating back to the 2009 MTV VMAs, alleged that the singer was involved in a threesome with Justin Bieber and Harry Styles.He wrote: “Justin Bieber and Harry Styles f**ked Taylor Swift from both sides and didn’t call me… ON EVERYTHIIING THIS TWEET IS ONE THOUSAND PERCENT TRUE.” Swift has not responded to the comments, which have already sparked heated debates on social media.West also made sensational claims about his own romantic past, stating that he had relationships with Ashley Olsen and Madonna. “I used to f*ck Ashley that’s why the twins got the [shout] out on N-ggas in Paris,” he wrote, adding about Madonna: “When I made out with Madonna she was bragging about how she f*cked Basquiat and PAC. I was like damn she love to brag just like meee.”Despite the apology to JAY-Z, West followed up with a crude question about the rapper’s marriage to Beyoncé, asking: “Do Beyonce ever let Jay get p*ssy. I mean like at least a couple times.”He also took aim at Tyler, The Creator, stating: “Why I never asked Tyler to rap on my albums. Cause he can’t rap.” The posts continued with remarks about his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, race, sexuality, and even his own past life beliefs, with West stating that he believed he was both Hitler and Jesus in previous lives.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce just Taylor Swift’s next song title? Fans fear if he truly is her partner, or just a prelude to a platinum single As of now, no official responses have been issued by the celebrities mentioned. West’s posts remain visible on his social media account, continuing to draw strong reactions from fans, critics, and industry observers alike.","Kanye West posted over 100 messages on X (formerly Twitter) late Wednesday night.

The horrifying crash, which is the latest in a string of mid-air mishaps United States registered in the last few months, was caught on camera as eye witnesses recorded how the remains of the helicopter falling into the waters.The helicopter crashed mid air and split in half upon impact. Terrifying videos appeared on social media showing how the helicopter disintegrated mid-air and its parts plunged into the waters. According to fire officials, the chopper went down near Pier 40 on West Houston Street and West Street around 3:15 p.m (ET).Witnesses on social media described a “loud thumping noise” when the helicopter crashed, with what appeared to be a broken propeller.Fire officials said there were at least four people on board.Flightradar 24 which monitors air traffic real time said the aircraft involved is likely to be N216MH, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV.

""With an accident such as this, it will stir up more silt from the bottom."" ""It's very cold, they don't have divers on standby, so they're going to have to mobilize divers who will take some time to get there.

Carlos Sainz's €20K pre-race fine blamed on nature’s call, George Russell finds it hilariously unfortunate



Carlos Sainz faced a hefty fine for some very unique reason in recent Japanese GP. Formula 1 may be about precision timing, blistering speed, and intense focus, but few fans consider the more human aspects that drivers face just moments before lights out. One of those less glamorous realities was recently highlighted following the €20,000 fine issued to Carlos Sainz for missing the Japanese national anthem at Suzuka – a delay reportedly caused by an upset stomach.Carlos Sainz, who later explained that a visit to the doctor was necessary before the race, saw the fine partially suspended due to mitigating circumstances. Yet even with a reduced penalty, the incident sparked conversation across the paddock, with fellow driver George Russell stepping in to offer a candid explanation of the pre-race challenges F1 drivers encounter.“I've got to be honest; I totally appreciate that we have a duty to be there for the national anthem but it's not quite as straightforward as people may think for us to be there on time,” Russell shared, highlighting how a seemingly minor delay can snowball due to bathroom queues, impromptu interviews, or grid disruptions.As a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, Russell provided insight that resonates beyond just Sainz’s situation. While appearing calm and composed on the grid, drivers often juggle personal necessities and media obligations within a tight schedule. “We're trying to take our moment for the grand prix,” he added, emphasising that nature doesn't always wait for protocol.Sainz, speaking during the Bahrain Grand Prix, didn’t shy away from addressing the punishment either. ""I'm the biggest supporter of punctuality... So I was the first one to put my hand up and say, 'I'm late, sorry for that',"" he said. But the €10,000 financial penalty for being just a few seconds late left him incredulous. “I don't know if I'll get another fine for saying this… but shit happens.”Russell, too, acknowledged the absurdity, calling it a “pretty expensive poo.” Still, he chose to focus on the broader need for unity between F1 leadership and drivers. “Moving forward, we just want collaboration... It just doesn't make any sense to be fighting on these topics.”In a sport where milliseconds define legacy, even a trip to the bathroom has now become a topic for FIA scrutiny — and a costly one at that.Also Read: ""We still have work"": Max Verstappen warns Red Bull fans not to get carried away after dominant Japanese Grand Prix win","F1 driver Carlos Sainz was fined €20,000 for missing the Japanese national anthem at Suzuka.

'Terrible helicopter crash in the Hudson River': Trump offers condolences

A helicopter ride over New York City ended in tragedy on Thursday afternoon when a tourist chopper carrying six people broke apart mid-air and crashed into the Hudson River, reports the New York PostThe crash killed everyone on board. The victims included tech executive Agustin Escobar, head of Siemens Spain, his wife, and their three children, who had just landed in the city from Barcelona earlier that day. The pilot, whose identity has not yet been released, also died.Video captured by a bystander and shared with The Post showed the helicopter losing its tail and rotors before slamming into the water, causing a massive splash.The accident unfolded around 3.15 pm near Pier 40, off West Houston Street and West Street. Witnesses say the helicopter appeared to fall apart in the air before plunging like a stone into the icy river.Emergency crews pulled the six victims from the river, four of whom were declared dead at the scene. The remaining two died at the hospital. The New York City fire department (FDNY) confirmed the aircraft had split in half before going down.Officials have launched a full investigation to determine what caused the aircraft to fall apart so suddenly.Bystanders described the scene as the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV spiralled out of control.A bystander, Charles McSorley, was walking towards Hoboken from Jersey City when he heard a loud boom and saw the helicopter disintegrating mid-flight.“But you could literally see that the propeller just snapped right off. You can see it snap off, and then it just came straight down,” McSorley told the Post. “It sounded like the helicopter was struggling all of a sudden.”Another witness, Nicholas Bahamonde, was in the middle of a work Zoom call in his Jersey City flat when he saw the tail rotor break off.“I jumped up and I said, ‘Oh my God, there’s a helicopter going down into the Hudson right now.’ I saw it break apart, spiral and crash land into the water very clearly.”Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Tours , the company operating the flight, expressed his sorrow, saying he was “devastated” by the crash.“I’m a father and a grandfather and to have children on there, I’m devastated. I’m absolutely devastated,” he told the Post. “I haven’t seen anything like that in my 30 years in the helicopter business.”Roth suggested a possible bird strike or rotor failure could have been the cause of crash but he said that he was not sure. The only thing I could guess – I got no clue – is that it either had a bird strike or the main rotor blades failed. I have no clue.

Looks like six people, the pilot, two adults, and three children, are no longer with us. The footage of the accident is horrendous. God bless the families and friends of the victims. Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and his talented staff are on it.”","A tourist helicopter carrying six people broke apart mid-air and crashed into the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon.

Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panama-deal-allows-us-to-deploy-troops-to-canal/articleshow/120184601.cms,"US and Panamanian military forces conduct a joint drill at the Panama Canal during the visit of US defense secretary Pete Hegseth to Port of Rodman in West Panama, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP)

PANAMA: US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP Thursday, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway.The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and ""other activities.""The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught.But it gives the United States broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago.Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade.His administration has vowed to ""take back"" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999.The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama.However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino.- 'Country on fire' -Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases.Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be ""unacceptable.""He warned Hegseth: ""Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire.""In the watered-down ""Memorandum of Understanding"", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions.The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty -- not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion -- and Panama will retain control over any installations.Panama will also have to agree to any deployments.But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little succor to worried Panamanians.The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States.They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega.That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital.Trump vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations.By law, Panama operates the canal giving access to all nations.But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades.Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country.The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal.",US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal.

Why Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel was removed as acting ATF chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-origin-fbi-director-kash-patel-was-removed-as-acting-atf-chief/articleshow/120145197.cms,"AP photo

Poll Do you agree with the decision to remove Kash Patel as acting head of the ATF? No, he should have been given more time. Yes, it was the right move.

Why was Kash Patel removed?

While it was not immediately clear why Patel was removed, a justice department official said his removal was not due to poor performance, and that it was a standard interim arrangement until senate-confirmed appointments are made. Spokesperson Harrison Fields said Patel’s time at the ATF was temporary and that he is now “excelling” at the FBI.

Patel was heading both the FBI and ATF, two large and complex agencies. Reports suggest the dual responsibility may have been unmanageable.

They say Patel had only visited ATF headquarters once and was mostly absent from agency matters during his short tenure.

His sudden appointment in February reportedly shocked career staff at ATF. Though he encouraged the agency to focus on violent gang crimes, insiders told Reuters his engagement stopped there.

Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel has been removed as the acting head of the Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF), weeks after being given the post alongside his role as FBI director. The White House confirmed army secretary Daniel Driscoll as his replacement.His removal, though confirmed by the Justice Department , was not officially announced. According to sources cited by the Associated Press, Patel was ousted in late February, only days after taking the oath of office.In fact, as late as April, Patel was still listed as the ATF’s acting director on the agency’s website and featured in press releases. It wasn’t until this week that senior ATF officials were informed of the leadership change, raising eyebrows over the opaque handling of the matter.Army secretary Daniel Driscoll has now taken over as acting head of the ATF, while continuing in his existing role blurring the traditional line between defence and domestic law enforcement.The ATF handles key responsibilities such as investigating violent crime, gun trafficking, arson, and bombings, and plays a technical role in tracing firearms used in crimes.","Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel has been removed as the acting head of the Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF) The White House confirmed army secretary Daniel Driscoll as his replacement.

The Insider as Outsider

The Second Lady in the Library

When Usha Vance stood beside her husband on Inauguration Day, watching J.D. Vance take the oath of office as Vice President of the United States, she looked serene. Composed. Unbothered. In a soft pink wool coat, accented with oversized floral earrings and her signature streak of silver hair swept into a bun, she embodied grace under pressure—and quiet resistance in a movement not built for her.It was a striking image. The daughter of Indian immigrants, raised Hindu, now the Second Lady of the United States in the second Trump administration. But while the photos were celebratory, the comment sections told a different story.“Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol,” one MAGA-aligned user posted. “Will there be a cow in the White House soon?” asked another. The mockery wasn’t about policy. It was about presence. Identity. Faith. Usha knows this. And yet, she remains calm, strategic—and unfazed.Born Usha Chilukuri, she was raised in San Diego, the daughter of two Indian immigrants who arrived in the 1980s to build a better life. Her father was a mechanical engineer. Her mother, a molecular biologist. Usha soared—earning degrees from Yale and Cambridge, editing the Yale Law Journal, and clerking for Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Friends from Yale Law still describe her as “formidable,” “ridiculously intelligent,” and “almost intimidating in her composure.” One classmate noted she could have easily become Solicitor General by 40.Instead, she married J.D. Vance—Marine, author ofand now MAGA’s heir apparent. Their marriage, as one friend put it, is a partnership of “two people who weren’t supposed to meet.” He grew up in a chaotic, working-class household in Middletown, Ohio. She grew up in a quiet, achievement-focused suburb. He arrived at Yale with debt and a chip on his shoulder. She came with impeccable credentials and an instinct to defuse, not escalate.Together, they represent what America often claims to be—but rarely makes space for: pluralistic, post-tribal, unexpectedly united.Indian-Americans, long seen as a “model minority,” had become increasingly visible within conservative circles—sparking admiration and backlash in equal measure. Vivek Ramaswamy had a star turn during the campaign and is now a frontrunner for Governor of Ohio. Kash Patel, Jay Bhattacharya, Sriram Krishnan, and even Tulsi Gabbard (an honorary desi in the eyes of many) now hold influential positions in the administration.And yet, the resentment remains palpable. MAGA’s evangelical wing bristles at non-Christian figures shaping policy. Anti-immigration voices frame Indian-American technocrats as elitist interlopers. What began as admiration for their credentials has curdled into suspicion. Some far-right commentators have even described it as “an invasion by tech elites.”In her first interview as Second Lady, she addressed the online racism that spiked after a 25-year-old Indian engineer tried to popularise the phrase “normalize Indian hate”—and was later rehired by Elon Musk, reportedly at J.D. Vance’s urging. “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘normalising Indian hate’? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible,” she told The Free Press. Still, she stopped short of a sweeping indictment. “I think it’s our relationship to this information… that is potentially new,” she said. “Very, very intelligent people say things that are sometimes very, very ill-founded because we are now in this world in which all conversations happen based on limited information very quickly.” It was a shift in frame—from hate to media structure, from bigotry to the digital churn. The pivot was subtle, but telling.Much of Usha’s public role is shaped by absence—by what she doesn’t say, doesn’t do, doesn’t signal. But in that same interview, she offered a glimpse into the private realities of life beside one of the most polarising men in American politics. “I don’t know that he’s asking me for advice so much as, it can be a very lonely, lonely world not to share with someone,” she said. This, more than anything, sketches the emotional architecture of the Vance marriage: two people who are insiders and outsiders, bound by love and by a shared sense of remove. Their intimacy is not forged through political alliance, but through existential oddity. “There are plenty of people who caricature others on the right,” she added. “It’s really easy to do that.” Empathy, in Usha’s world, is a strategic posture—but not an insincere one.Asked what it feels like to be a brown woman in a world of blondes, Botox, and Fox News glam, Usha responds with characteristic restraint. “It would be really hard for me to be blonde,” she joked. “That colour would look totally absurd.” She lets her hair go grey. She doesn’t use a stylist. She’s not concerned with optics. “For what it’s worth,” she added, “my reception into this world… has been really positive.” Whether that’s wholly true or simply the truth she chooses to see is unclear. But it speaks to her method: focus on the humanity in front of you, not the hostility behind the screen.What makes Usha Vance so effective—and so difficult to categorise—is that she never argues. She simply exists. She wears a sari to the inauguration and offers no explanation. She introduces her husband at the Republican National Convention without leaning into jingoism or affect. She raises three children in a fortress on a hill and insists on reading physical books.At the moment, she’s reading, by Colm Tóibín—a novel about an Irish immigrant woman torn between two countries, two selves.The metaphor is hard to miss. Usha Vance isn’t fighting MAGA’s culture war. She’s refusing to be defined by it.Political scientist Paul Sracic once remarked: “It’s difficult to accuse Vance of being sympathetic to white nationalists when his wife is Indian American and his children are Indian American. That insulates him from that attack.” That may be true. But Usha’s role isn’t merely to insulate. It’s to complicate the narrative.She’s the insider who can’t quite belong. The immigrant daughter who rarely speaks about immigration. The Hindu woman whose gods remain suspect in a movement still centred around Christian nationalism. When asked what the media gets wrong about her husband, she doesn’t bristle. “There are lots of people who have just imagined all sorts of narratives about us,” she said. “To me, the highest priority right now is to be actually a normal person.” It’s a goal that politics rarely permits—and that MAGA, with its appetite for spectacle, may never truly understand.Each morning, Usha Vance reads in the green-painted library of the vice president’s residence. There’s a fireplace. Silence. A kind of enforced stillness. Her children—Ewan, Vivek, and Mirabel—race through the halls above. “One of the ways to counteract [this world] is to read paper books,” she told The Free Press. As if turning pages could buffer a person from the chaos just outside the door. It’s a lonely place to be normal. But Usha Vance is very good at being alone in plain sight.","Indian-Americans, long seen as a “model minority,” had become increasingly visible within conservative circles.

Pierre Poilievre: 'Hindu-Canadians don’t feel safe': Why many Indo-Canadians are backing Pierre Poilievre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hindu-canadians-dont-feel-safe-why-many-indo-canadians-are-backing-pierre-poilievre/articleshow/120164844.cms,"'Groundbreaking news': The Online Backlash



A Diaspora Caught in a Diplomatic Firestorm



Political Allegiances, Community Confusion



The Don Patel Fallout



Influence or Interference?



In April 2022, Conservative leadership contender Pierre Poilievre attended a community event at the Vancouver home of Aditya Tawatia , a realtor and long-time participant in Indo-Canadian civic and political circles. The event, attended by local supporters, was one of many such gatherings on Poilievre’s cross-country campaign tour. Tawatia donated $1,675 to Poilievre’s leadership bid—the maximum allowed under Elections Canada rules—and has since contributed additional funds to the Conservative Party.Tawatia is one of several Indo-Canadian professionals who previously helped establish the Overseas Friends of BJP Canada, a group created in 2014 to support political change in India. While the organisation is no longer active, some of its former leaders remain engaged in Canadian politics and community advocacy, and have supported Poilievre’s leadership and the broader Conservative movement. Their involvement has drawn attention in recent weeks, raising questions about diaspora political activity, foreign influence, and the role of diaspora organisations in Canadian campaigns.A recent Global News piece scrutinised the contributions, suggesting a coordinated effort by former BJP sympathisers to shape Canadian politics. The report raised the spectre of foreign interference, citing the past affiliations of donors who helped set up or participated in BJP-aligned diaspora groups. Yet for critics of the story, the controversy is less about foreign meddling and more about a double standard.Conservative figures and commentators swiftly pushed back. “Canadian citizen who was born in India gave the legal amount for an individual to Pierre Poilievre,” wrote Daniel Bordman . “More groundbreaking news at 11…” Ezra Levant framed the issue more bluntly: “The Conservatives raised $41.7 million in 2024 from over 200,000 donors. One Canadian who is friends with India's PM donated $1,675… That—and not Mark Carney ’s $250 million loan from China—is foreign interference, to Global News.”To supporters of Poilievre — and to many within the Indo-Canadian community — the entire episode reflects a deeper discomfort within Canada’s political and media class: a discomfort with certain immigrant communities being politically active, particularly when their values and affiliations lean right.“This is how democracy works,” said Tawatia to the Globe and Mail. “We are the most patriotic Canadians. We are doing good things for democracy. We like the Conservative Party — so what?”That view is echoed by others formerly involved in diaspora groups aligned with the BJP. They stress that their early work was about rooting out corruption in India’s Congress Party government, not pushing a foreign agenda in Canada. Since then, many have reorganised into domestic community groups focused on Indo-Canadian issues. Several no longer have ties to Indian political parties, but maintain strong views on Canada’s relationship with India and on growing tensions over the Khalistan movement.The renewed spotlight on former Friends of BJP leaders comes at a tense time in Canada-India relations. In June 2023, Sikh terrorist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was gunned down in the parking lot of a gurdwara in Surrey, B.C. Months later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made an explosive statement in Parliament: Canadian intelligence believed the Indian government was involved in the assassination.Indian intelligence reports show that Nijjar was not simply an activist, but had been undergoing arms training in Pakistan under the protection of groups hostile to both India and the West. He was reportedly connected to efforts aimed at reviving Sikh militancy and recruiting for separatist causes from Canadian soil. A Canadian commission report later found no 'definitive link' between any foreign involvement and Nijjar's assassination.The allegations — strongly denied by India — shattered diplomatic relations. Trade talks were suspended. High commissioners were expelled. But in parts of Canada’s Indian diaspora, especially among Hindu-Canadians, Trudeau’s intervention didn’t feel like a defence of sovereignty. It felt like the government was taking sides.“The big challenge we find is the Khalistani element,” said Shiv Bhasker, a former OFBJP official and Poilievre donor who later formed the Overseas Friends of India Canada. Bhasker said his group has lobbied for stronger Indo-Canadian ties and raised concerns about what he described as Khalistan-linked intimidation of Hindu Canadians — including at temples and community events.“Hindu-Canadians don’t feel safe,” he said. “They feel that intelligence agencies and police forces have been compromised, or at least infiltrated by these Khalistan elements.”Not everyone agrees. Balpreet Singh of the World Sikh Organization called the depiction of Khalistan supporters as a threat to national security “a narrative right out of India.” He pointed out that Canada’s RCMP has accused India of serious criminal activity — not the other way around.“The idea that the RCMP is being told what to do by Khalistanis is absurd,” Singh said. “India has engaged in transnational repression here in Canada. That’s what’s at issue.”Caught in the middle of this diplomatic and ideological dispute are Canadian politicians — especially Conservatives, who have been careful in their statements about both India’s conduct and Sikh community concerns.Poilievre has attended multiple community events hosted by former OFBJP organisers. In October 2022 and again in 2023, he spoke at Diwali functions on Parliament Hill co-hosted by Bhasker’s Overseas Friends of India Canada and the Canada India Global Forum — the rebranded version of one of the OFBJP organisations. He sat next to India’s High Commissioner to Canada just weeks after Trudeau’s bombshell Nijjar allegation. A Conservative spokesperson defended the appearances, saying they were community celebrations, not political endorsements.Still, some in the Sikh community view the appearances as tacit approval. “It is really concerning if those are the individuals now donating, promoting, and pushing candidates,” said a spokesperson for the Sikh Federation of Canada. “It suggests a lack of distance between our political class and foreign-linked networks.”Within the Indo-Canadian community itself, opinions are divided. Some, like Bhasker, remain staunchly Conservative and believe the party aligns best with their economic and cultural values. “We don’t believe in handouts,” he said. “We want to work hard. We want lower taxes. We want smaller government.”Others feel let down. Azad Kaushik, another former OFBJP leader who formed the National Alliance of Indo-Canadians, said some recent Conservative candidates appeared sympathetic to Khalistan. “I’m a hardcore Conservative,” he said. “I’ll vote Conservative. But we are not happy.”And then there was Don Patel.In early 2025, the Conservative Party dropped its candidate in Etobicoke North, Don Patel, after he “liked” a social media post that suggested sending Khalistani activists to India for Prime Minister Modi to “take care” of them. His emoji reaction — a heart and a hug — triggered criticism. The party disavowed him, calling the post “clearly unacceptable.”The incident highlighted the minefield the Conservatives now find themselves in. On one hand, they are trying to court a growing base of Indo-Canadian voters who feel disenchanted with the Liberals. On the other hand, they are under pressure to draw a line between cultural solidarity and ethnic nationalism.Tawatia, for one, insists that this is about Canada — not India. “I have so many friends in Toronto who are not Conservative,” he said. “This narrative that we are some kind of foreign influence operation — it’s nonsense.”For now, the debate shows no signs of slowing. Canada has passed legislation to create a foreign agent registry, similar to the US system that governs overseas political activities. But the system is not yet operational. In the meantime, diaspora engagement continues — legally, loudly, and with growing political visibility.The line between engagement and interference remains murky. Some argue it’s a distinction of transparency and intent: donations made openly by Canadian citizens, regardless of heritage, should not be lumped in with covert influence. Others argue the ecosystem of ethnic politics — especially when linked to countries with global ambitions — deserves closer scrutiny.In the end, the controversy surrounding Poilievre’s Indo-Canadian donors may say less about them and more about Canada’s ongoing struggle to reconcile multiculturalism with foreign policy, and diaspora activism with national interest.As one observer put it: “You can’t ask immigrants to integrate and then panic when they participate.”","Conservative leadership contender Pierre Poilievre attended a community event at the Vancouver home of Aditya Tawatia, a realtor and long-time participant in Indo-Canadian civic and political circles.

Trump admin faces deadline on Mahmoud Khalil deportation

Judge asks for more evidence in Mahmoud Khalil case or says it will be dropped

The Trump administration has filed a brief memo in response to an immigration judge ’s request for evidence in its bid to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil .The memo, signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, argues that Khalil’s continued presence in the US could harm foreign policy objectives, specifically the country’s efforts to combat anti-Semitism. It claims that while Khalil’s activism was lawful, allowing him to stay would undermine policies to protect Jewish students and combat anti-Semitism both in the US and globally.The memo does not accuse Khalil of any criminal activity. Rather, it centers around his pro-Palestinian activism , specifically his role as a spokesperson for protests against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Rubio’s submission, filed Wednesday, claims that Khalil's activities, though lawful, threaten US interests. He wrote that condoning Khalil's actions could “severely undermine” US foreign policy goals related to anti-Semitism.Khalil’s attorneys have argued that the Trump administration is attempting to stifle his free speech regarding Palestine. They contend that the government's case against him is baseless. In a statement, lawyers Marc Van Der Hout and Johnny Sinodis declared, “There is not a single shred of proof that Mahmoud’s presence in America poses any threat,” referring to his arrest and detention in Louisiana after being taken from New York in early March.The memo also calls for the deportation of another US permanent resident, though the person’s identity is not disclosed. Despite references in the memo to other supporting documents, including a “subject profile” of Khalil, these have not been submitted to the immigration court.Khalil, who is 30 years old and a Palestinian-born Syrian national, has firmly rejected allegations of anti-Semitism. In a letter from jail, he accused the administration of targeting him as part of a larger effort to suppress dissent. He also expressed his desire to be freed to witness the birth of his first child, noting, “I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been engaged in a broader campaign against anti-Semitism on university campuses, though critics argue it is an attack on free speech. In recent weeks, the government has withheld funding from universities, demanding they punish protesters and make other changes in exchange for reinstating the funding.Khalil’s case is part of a larger trend where US authorities have revoked visas and taken action against international students and activists critical of Israel or its treatment of Palestinians. Khalil’s lawyers argue that no evidence has been presented linking him to Hamas, a militant group that has been central to the government’s justification for his detention. The latest filing makes no mention of Hamas.In a related case, another Columbia University student, Yunseo Chung, faces similar deportation efforts. Chung, who was arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at Barnard College, is fighting her deportation in court. Her attorneys included Rubio’s letter in court filings, seeking access to any documents that would shed light on the government’s decision to target her for deportation.","The Trump administration has filed a brief memo in response to an immigration judge ’s request for evidence in its bid to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil.

Captain Canuck slaps down Trump, Musk in comic inspired by US-Canada trade war

A 1970s comic book hero is experiencing a dramatic resurgence thanks to renewed political tension between Canada and the United States under President Donald Trump Captain Canuck — the crimson-and-white-clad protector of Canadian sovereignty — has emerged as an unlikely cultural symbol in response to Trump’s annexation rhetoric and trade threats.""It's got a lot of Canadians, you know, thinking about their identity as Canadians and feeling more united as Canadians. We feel like, okay, we've got to stand in opposition to these proposals,"" Richard Comely , the 74-year-old co-creator of the character told news agency Reuters.In a bold throwback to classic comic book storytelling, Elon Musk is cast as the loyal sidekick to 'supervillain' Donald Trump — both of whom find themselves on the receiving end of Captain Canuck’s justice. One panel shows the Canadian superhero forcefully intercepting Trump mid-action, while another depicts a dramatic scene of both Trump and Musk being hauled away by the collar, helpless against the red-and-white-clad guardian of Canadian sovereignty.Comely, who first introduced Captain Canuck in 1975, said the current political climate has triggered a wave of national pride. “All of a sudden Canadians are looking to Captain Canuck as a symbol. And it's basically, to them, Captain Canuck symbolizes independence.”Originally designed as a uniquely Canadian counterpart to Captain America, Captain Canuck’s alter ego is Tom Evans, a Mountie whose encounter with aliens granted him superhuman abilities. His costume prominently features maple leaves and the country’s signature red and white colors.“So in a sense, we have Mr. Trump to thank for a bit of resurgence,” Comely added, noting a recent uptick in interest from Canadian companies due to the ongoing cross-border tensions.The latest cover of Captain Canuck’s upcoming 50th anniversary edition features the superhero wagging his finger at Donald Trump — a visual response to the US President’s controversial remarks suggesting Canada should be incorporated as a US state.Comely reflected on the cultural forces that inspired the character’s birth: ""I think there was an undercurrent, so to speak, in Canada in the '70s. So I think Canadians were starting to feel like, you know, like they should acknowledge the fact that we had our own country, and we had our own culture and be proud of the fact that we were Canadians.""Since its debut, the franchise has seen more than 4 million Captain Canuck comic books, graphic novels, and related publications printed across the globe. The journey hasn’t been linear — Comely took a break from the comic world to raise his large family, with a short revival in the 1990s through the “Captain Canuck Reborn” series.In 2012, the character found a new lease on life through an exclusive licensing deal with Chapterhouse Comics . This collaboration launched Captain Canuck into a modern era with animated web series and branded merchandise, cementing his place in contemporary Canadian pop culture.While Captain Canuck’s original narrative envisioned foreign groups attempting to infiltrate and destabilize a powerful Canada, Comely is quick to clarify: “Of course, never, never in any of those stories was it America that was going to be taking over Canada.”Still, the superhero’s resurgence in popularity amid Trump-era politics seems fitting, as Canadians rally around a long-standing fictional icon to express very real sentiments of sovereignty and unity.","Captain Canuck is the red-and-white-clad protector of Canadian sovereignty.

Judge orders illegals to register with US govt in new immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-illegals-to-register-with-us-govt-in-new-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/120183893.cms,"AP photo

A federal judge granted the Trump administration another legal victory on Thursday, upholding a requirement that all individuals living in the US illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation.Judge Trevor Neil McFadden, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of the administration, asserting that the requirement to register and document was an existing law that applied to everyone in the US who is not a citizen. However, McFadden did not address the substance of the administration’s argument, instead determining that the group challenging the mandate lacked the legal standing to pursue their case.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that the registration deadline for those who have been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday. DHS emphasized that the requirement would be enforced without exception.""President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said. ""If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream. The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.""The DHS first alerted illegal immigrants about the registration and departure requirement in February, warning that failing to comply would result in serious consequences.The Immigration and Nationality Act , which was passed in 1952, provides tools for tracking illegal immigrants and encouraging voluntary departure. DHS outlined penalties for migrants who fail to register, leave the country, or notify authorities of address changes. Noncompliance could result in fines, imprisonment, or both.This registration requirement applies to all individuals aged 14 and older who do not have legal status in the US It also includes Canadians who have stayed in the US for more than 30 days, including ""snowbirds"" who spend the winter months in states like Florida.While the registration has always been part of US law, it has rarely been enforced in the past. The most notable instance of enforcement occurred after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when a special registration program was implemented for noncitizen males from 25 countries, most of which were Arab or Muslim. Although the program did not lead to terrorism convictions, it resulted in over 13,000 people being placed in deportation proceedings before being suspended in 2011 and fully dissolved in 2016.",Judge Trevor Neil McFadden ruled in favor of the administration. The registration requirement applies to all individuals aged 14 and older who do not have legal status in the US. The deadline for those who have been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday.

A routine sightseeing flight turned tragic Thursday when a helicopter carrying six people nosedived into the Hudson River, sending a terrifying plume of water skyward and leaving no survivors.Startling video footage, captured by a stunned onlooker, showed the moment the New York Helicopter aircraft appeared to break apart in midair before smashing into the frigid waters near Hoboken around 3:20 pm Witnesses were horrified as the chopper’s tail and rotor system seemed to detach just moments before impact.Nicholas Bahamonde, 34, witnessed the devastating moment unfold from his Jersey City apartment.“I look up to the left, and I saw the tail rotor break off of the helicopter, so it was already split in the air, and then the front main part of the helicopter started spiraling into the ocean,” he told New York Post.“I jumped up and I said, ‘Oh my God, there’s a helicopter going down into the Hudson right now.’ And so I got off that and called 911, immediately. But I saw it. I saw it break apart, spiral and crash land into the water like, very clearly.”Bahamonde was in the middle of a work Zoom call when he heard a deafening noise. That bang, it turned out, marked the beginning of the helicopter’s fatal descent.Eyewitness Charles McSorley, 59, was walking between Jersey City and Hoboken when the helicopter caught his attention. What he saw next left him stunned.“Looked like the propellers came straight off. And I saw it come straight down,” he recalled. “And I just started walking fast towards Hoboken because it wasn’t far from the Hoboken train station.”McSorley said there was a sudden shift in the helicopter’s behavior. “But you could literally see that the propeller just snapped right off. You can see it snap off, and then it just came straight down.”“The rotors just ‘snapped right off,’” he added.In another chilling account, Bruce Wall described the final moments before impact, saying, “Just walking toward this way from Hoboken and started just hearing something and then you look to the left into the water and you see the plane slowly falling apart.”“It was falling apart probably 15 feet before it actually fell and then the tail whipped off and the propeller fell while it was falling, crashing, the propeller, as you see in the video, the propeller was in the air still propelling while the plane was falling down.”Authorities later confirmed that the pilot and five tourists from Spain, including three children, were aboard the ill-fated aircraft. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene, and the remaining two died after being rushed to a nearby hospital.An official investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the crash, though early accounts suggest catastrophic mechanical failure.The video footage of the crash and the consistency of witness statements all point to the same horrifying sequence: the helicopter began to break apart in midair, leaving those on the ground powerless as the chopper spiraled into the Hudson below.","The New York Helicopter aircraft appeared to break apart in midair before smashing into the frigid waters near Hoboken.

U.S. Indo- Pacific Commander Reveals Deep Insights Into US Strategies To Contain China!

Admiral Samuel Paparo , head of the US Indo-Pacific Command , raised alarms on Thursday about China’s intensified military presence around Taiwan, suggesting that recent maneuvers are far more serious than standard drills.""With military pressure against Taiwan increasing by 300%, China's increasingly aggressive actions near Taiwan are not just exercises, they are rehearsals,"" Paparo said while addressing the Senate Armed Services Committee. He described China’s strategic shift as part of a broader modernization effort that threatens not only Taiwan but also US interests and allies across the region.""China's unprecedented aggression and military modernization poses a serious threat to the homeland, our allies and our partners,"" he emphasized, calling attention to the growing regional instability provoked by Beijing’s actions.While Taiwan considers itself an independent, sovereign nation, it is still officially recognized as part of China under the ""One China"" policy — a stance maintained by the United Nations, the US, and China itself. However, tensions continue to rise as Beijing steps up efforts to ""reunify"" Taiwan with the mainland, a goal that both Washington and Taipei have warned would upset the balance in the Indo-Pacific.The admiral pointed out that rather than cowing Taipei into submission, China's aggressive posture is having the opposite effect. ""While the [People’s Liberation Army] PLA attempts to intimidate the people of Taiwan and demonstrate coercive capabilities, these actions are backfiring, drawing increased global attention and accelerating Taiwan's own defense preparations,"" he said.Beyond the Taiwan Strait, Paparo also cautioned lawmakers about the broader implications of China’s accelerating military production. “China's outproducing the United States in air missile, maritime and space capability and accelerating these,"" he stated.He offered a stark comparison, noting that the Chinese military is building fighter jets at a rate 1.2 times that of the United States and is also outpacing the US in the production of naval vessels, advanced missiles, and space technologies. “I remain confident in our deterrence posture, but the trajectory must change,” Paparo concluded, signaling an urgent call for US defense innovation and readiness.","Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, raised alarms on Thursday about China’s intensified military presence around Taiwan.

The conditions inside the infamous El Salvador prison where deported migrants are held

Bondi reacts to Supreme Court pausing order on man mistakenly deported to El Salvador

Pres. Trump on man deported in error to El Salvador: 'We don't want him back'

The Supreme Court has instructed the administration of President Donald Trump to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador . However, it stopped short of requiring that he be brought back to the United States directly, leaving the next steps to be determined by a lower court.Abrego Garcia, who entered the United States around 2011, had previously been granted protection from deportation by an immigration judge in 2019. The judge ruled that he should not be removed to El Salvador due to threats against his life stemming from his family’s pupusa business. Despite that ruling, he was detained by immigration officers on March 12 and flown out of the country three days later.“Tonight, the rule of law prevailed. The Supreme Court upheld the District Judge’s order that the government has to bring Kilmar home,” said his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg . “Now they need to stop wasting time and get moving.”The unsigned opinion from the high court did not specify a deadline for facilitating Abrego Garcia’s return. It upheld US District Judge Paula Xinis’ order but distinguished between the terms “facilitate” and “effectuate.” While supporting the notion that the government should assist in bringing him back, the justices signaled concern that the original directive may have exceeded judicial authority.In a noteworthy remark, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to existing executive policies that call for assisting with an alien’s return if their presence is necessary for continued immigration proceedings. She, along with the other liberal justices, also criticized the administration’s characterization of the wrongful deportation as a mere “oversight.”“The Government now requests an order from this Court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law,” the liberal justices stated. “The only argument the Government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong.”Though the court did not reject the administration’s emergency appeal outright, the three liberal justices expressed that it should have been dismissed in full.The Trump administration , in its legal filings, argued that being compelled to “effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return would intrude upon executive authority, especially in foreign affairs. It emphasized that “facilitate” should be interpreted narrowly—merely removing any procedural or legal obstacles without mandating specific actions.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, recently confirmed to lead the administration’s appellate division, alleged that Abrego Garcia was a “ranking member” of MS-13. That claim has been used to argue that the protections granted by the 2019 court ruling no longer apply, since the administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist group.However, Abrego Garcia’s legal team disputes those accusations, asserting that he has no criminal history in Maryland or anywhere else in the country. Judge Stephanie Thacker of the 4th Circuit Court noted, “The government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang.” She described him instead as “a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life.”The case now returns to the lower court, where Judge Xinis is expected to provide clarification on the scope of her directive. The Supreme Court’s opinion emphasized that the court must proceed with “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”Legal analyst and Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck weighed in on the ambiguity of the ruling: “Although the ruling makes clear that the district court can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States, it is maddeningly vague about exactly how it’s supposed to do so.”“For instance, if the judge asks the government about the specific arrangements it’s made with the Salvadoran government and the government invokes the state secrets privilege, what happens then?” Vladeck added. “It is, yet again, punting in a context in which the government can take advantage of the punt – a loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss for Abrego García on what matters most.”Abrego Garcia’s deportation took place under a different authority than the controversial 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which has recently been invoked by the Trump administration and is facing multiple legal challenges. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the use of that statute but required that detainees be given notice and the opportunity for judicial review—though it left many procedural questions unanswered.Trump officials argued that negotiating with El Salvador on short notice was not feasible when the district court originally ordered Abrego Garcia’s return by a specific deadline. They also contended that decisions by the attorney general concerning deportation fall outside the jurisdiction of federal courts.Despite these arguments, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor of Abrego Garcia. The court determined that the judiciary retained the authority to review whether his deportation violated prior legal protections and that he remained, effectively, in US custody—even while imprisoned in El Salvador.Abrego Garcia was deported on March 15 and placed in a notoriously harsh Salvadoran prison. His case continues to raise broader questions about immigration enforcement, executive power, and the extent of judicial oversight in foreign affairs.","Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

American Airlines Mishap: Two American Airlines planes graze each other at Regan Airport; several Congress reps on board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-american-airlines-planes-graze-each-other-at-regan-airport-several-congress-reps-on-board/articleshow/120175281.cms,"Rep Grace Meng posted a video informing everyone that there was no injury in the mishap involving two American Airlines planes at Ronald Regan National Airport.

In a freak accident that resulted in no injury, two planes grazed each other on the tarmac at Ronald Regan Washington National Airport, which recently witnessed that tragic mid-air crash that killed 67 people. At least six members of Congress from New York and New Jersey were aboard the plane.The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it would “investigate” the 12:45 p.m. incident on the DCA taxiway, when the JFK-bound American Airlines flight carrying the lawmakers was bumped by an AA Bombardier CRJ900 bound for Charleston, SC.“American Eagle flight 5490, operated by PSA Airlines, made contact on a DCA taxiway with American Eagle flight 4522, operated by Republic Airways. Safety is our top priority, and we apologize to our customers for their experience,” an American Airlines spokesperson said in a statement. Both planes damaged their winglets and were taken out of service for inspection.At least 143 people were onboard both planes.“Serving in Congress has come with some once in a lifetime experiences … like just now while stationary on the runway at DCA, another plane just bumped into our wing,” Suffolk County Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) posted to X on Thursday. “Heading back to the gate, but thankfully everyone is ok!” “(And ⁦@RepGraceMeng is handing out grapes!)” he added, referring to Grace Meng (D-Queens).Four other local Democrats — Reps. Adriano Espaillat, Ritchie Torres and Gregory Meeks of New York, as well as Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) — were also on board.“I’ve been flying for over ten years to Washington. This has never happened to me,” Meng told reporters after deplaning. “We suddenly felt some shaking. The staff and the crew were very professional and kept everything orderly, calm and safe,” she said. “Some of the passengers said that they literally saw it clip the plane. And a little piece fell off, as you can see in the back. They’re fixing it right now. And they’re providing a different, new plane for us to fly back to New York.”",At least six members of Congress from New York and New Jersey were aboard the plane.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

'Police have swiftly moved to take action,' says Yunus

At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests held earlier this week, reports Dhaka Tribune.Demonstrations erupted in multiple cities, including the capital Dhaka, on Monday as thousands took to the streets to condemn Israel’s continued military actions in Gaza. Protesters from various political, social, religious, cultural, and professional organisations joined forces in what organisers described as part of a global movement supporting Palestinians.However, the protests turned violent when, in cities like Bogra, Sylhet, Cox’s Bazar and others, mobs vandalised shops and businesses, with some targeting outlets perceived to have ties to Israel. Businesses such as Bata, KFC and Pizza Hut came under attack as demonstrators called for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products.The rallies saw widespread student participation, with many skipping classes and exams to march in solidarity. Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held up placards, and set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Chants denouncing American backing for Israel and frustration over the inaction of international bodies like the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Arab League echoed through the streets.However, while many gatherings remained peaceful, some turned violent, leading to incidents of property damage and theft.Bangladesh's interim chief advisor Muhammad Yunus addressed the unrest in a statement posted on X. “Bangladesh police have swiftly moved to take action over the violent and unlawful events that unfolded during the Pro-Gaza protests in several cities on Monday,” he wrote. “These attacks and acts of vandalism are an affront to public safety and the rule of law.”He further confirmed that at least 60 individuals had initially been arrested.In an earlier X post on Monday, Yunus strongly condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.”He referred to the situation as a “human catastrophe,” noting that Israel’s breach of ceasefire agreements had led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians—many of them women and children—while also blocking humanitarian aid.According to Gaza’s health ministry, since October 7, 2023, over 50,000 people have been killed and at least 115,000 injured as a result of the ongoing conflict. Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly failed, with both sides accusing each other of violations despite mounting international pressure.","At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests.

Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza. Different organisations spanning political, social, cultural, religious and professional spheres took to Dhaka's streets in protest.The demonstrations form part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, according to organisers. Students have stayed away from classes and examinations to join the protests.Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of interim government in Bangladesh, said in a statement on X, ""The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.
