MYSURU: A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Saligrama taluk, Mysuru district, Saturday.According to police, the 20-year-old woman, married and has a two-year-old child, was found with her mouth and right part of her face ripped open in what seemed to be a controlled blast triggered by an unidentified device. When police arrived, Darshitha was found dead in a pool of blood on the floor of the hotel room in Bherya village, 55km from Mysuru city.Police claimed the suspect, Siddaraju, from Bettadapura in Periyapatna, had brought Darshitha from Hunsur's Gerasanahalli to visit a temple. He allegedly plotted the murder of Darshitha as she refused to marry him, according to police. They reportedly knew each other for 7 years. Siddaraju worked at a hardware shop, while she lived with her parents at Gerasanahalli. Her husband lives in Kerala.Police suspect the accused may have used a pressure-triggering object or electricity to kill her. It's suspected Siddaraju may have electrocuted her by forcibly inserting a cable into her mouth and turning the power switch on, as a two-metre electric cable was recovered from the spot.Siddaraju allegedly attempted to carry Darshitha's body on his shoulder.The hotel staff asked him not to move the body until police arrived, police stated.Mysuru superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhana said police are being assisted by a forensic science expert to identify the object used to kill the woman. He ruled out the use of gelatine sticks or any combustible materials to injure and kill the woman. An investigation is being carried out to identify the object used to cause her severe bleeding in her mouth, which resulted in her death.According to lodge manager Manu, the duo arrived seeking a room around 2pm Saturday. Siddaraju introduced Darshitha as his wife. He went out to get food, returned with a parcel in a plastic cover about 30 minutes later and claimed the room was locked from inside.Immediately, lodge staff force-opened the door. To their shock, they found Darshitha dead in a pool of blood.Manu appeared to suggest it was a mysterious blast since there was no sound of an explosion and there were no traces of gunpowder inside the room.","A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Mysuru district.

The riots erupted after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for Operation Blue Star , a military action earlier that year to remove militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar.Following her death, mobs, often armed with voter lists and political backing, targeted Sikhs in Delhi and several other cities. Over 3,000 Sikhs were brutally killed, their homes and businesses looted or burned, and many women faced horrific violence. Eyewitness accounts and later investigations indicated the role of Congress leaders in instigating and organising the violence, while the state machinery largely failed to act.The riots left deep scars on India’s social fabric, fostering alienation among Sikhs and fueling militancy in Punjab. Justice for victims has been slow, with many cases dragging on for decades.Rajiv Gandhi, who was sworn in as Prime Minister soon after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, made a controversial remark about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots during a rally at the Boat Club in New Delhi on 19 November 1984, Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary. He said, “When a big tree falls, the earth shakes.”The statement was widely interpreted as an attempt to justify or downplay the violence against Sikhs, though Congress later maintained he was speaking metaphorically about the impact of his mother’s death on the nation.","Family members of those who lost their life in 1984 anti-Sikh riots will be given appropriate jobs in Haryana government. 121 people from the state were killed in the riots, reported news agency ANI.

Federal Reserve shake-up: Donald Trump fires Governor Lisa Cook; accuses her of ‘potentially criminal conduct’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-reserve-shake-up-donald-trump-fires-governor-lisa-cook-accuses-her-of-potentially-criminal-conduct/articleshow/123513644.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump and Lisa Cook (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump has removed Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position in a move that could set off a major legal fight over the independence of America’s central bank.Trump announced Cook’s dismissal on Monday evening through a letter posted on his Truth Social account, accusing her of mortgage fraud. “In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, [Americans] cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity,” he wrote.“I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position”, he added.The allegations against Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s board, were originally raised by Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte claimed Cook had declared two homes, one in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and another in Atlanta, as her primary residence in 2021 to obtain favourable loan terms, according to news agency AP.Pulte referred the matter to the Justice Department, which has opened an investigation at his request.Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In a statement last week, she said she had “no intention of being bullied to step down” and promised to provide facts to answer any legitimate questions.As per the New York Times, Trump’s move is legally questionable because the Federal Reserve Act allows a governor to be removed only for “cause,” such as proven neglect or misconduct. Cook’s term was meant to run until 2038, meaning her ouster could reshape the balance of the seven-member board.Legal experts believe she may continue in her role while the case works its way through the courts.The firing comes as Trump intensifies his criticism of the Fed for keeping interest rates steady despite his push for aggressive cuts. With Cook’s removal and another vacancy following the resignation of Governor Adriana Kugler earlier this month, Trump now has the chance to fill two seats.He has already nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, for Kugler’s slot, pending Senate confirmation.As per the New York Times, the dismissal likely highlights Trump’s effort to install political loyalists at the Fed. Analysts warn this could damage the bank’s independence at a time when its credibility is central to managing inflation and monetary stability.","US President Donald Trump has removed Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position.

National guard in Chicago?

(AP)

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker fired back at President Donald Trump on Tuesday, warning that any attempt to deploy the National Guard to Chicago would face fierce resistance from state and city officials.“We are watching, and we are taking names,” Pritzker said at a press conference overlooking the Chicago River. “This country has survived darker periods than the one that we’re going through right now.”Pritzker called Trump’s proposal to send in thousands of troops “an unconstitutional overreach” aimed at punishing political dissidents and scoring points with his base. “Mr President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here,” the governor said.Joining Pritzker were Mayor Brandon Johnson, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and US Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin. Officials framed the threatened deployment as a “dangerous step toward authoritarianism” that would put communities at risk.Mayor Johnson emphasized the city’s stance: “We believe you don’t solve crime by sending in the military. We are being targeted because of who we are as a city.”Trump, meanwhile, called Chicago “a disaster” and promised, “We go in, we will solve Chicago within one week, maybe less… no crime in Chicago.” Yet Chicago Police Department data shows murders dropped 31% and shootings fell 37% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to last year.This confrontation echoes past clashes in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, where Trump attempted to deploy federal troops over the objections of local Democratic leaders. Illinois officials warn that Chicago could join these cities as a flashpoint in the fight over federal authority versus local control.Pritzker, who is seeking a third term and has not ruled out a 2028 presidential bid, concluded: “If the president tries this, we will see the Trump administration in court. The state of Illinois is ready to stand against this military deployment with every peaceful tool we have.”","Illinois Governor JB Pritzker warned that any attempt to deploy the National Guard to Chicago would face fierce resistance from state and city officials. “Mr President, do not come to Chicago.

Anti-semitism row: Paris summons US ambassador Charles Kushner; slams ‘unacceptable’ allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/antisemitism-row-paris-summons-us-ambassador-slams-unacceptable-allegations/articleshow/123491877.cms,"File photo: French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner (Picture credit: AP)

France Explodes At US Diplomat’s Letter On Recognition Of Palestine State | ‘Jewish Life In Danger’

France has summoned the American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner, after he accused President Emmanuel Macron ’s government of failing to act strongly enough against antisemitism.The French foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday that Kushner’s allegations were “unacceptable” and that he had been called to appear at the ministry for Europe and foreign affairs on Monday.“France firmly rejects these allegations,” the ministry added, stressing that French authorities were “fully mobilised” to tackle antisemitic acts which it called “intolerable.” According to news agency AP, the ministry also warned that Kushner’s intervention violated the Vienna Convention by interfering in the internal affairs of another country.Kushner, a real-estate developer and father of Jared Kushner, who is married to US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, had published the remarks in a letter to Macron carried by the Wall Street Journal.In it, he alleged that antisemitism in France had “exploded” since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza. “In France, not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalised,” Kushner wrote, urging Macron to enforce hate-crime laws more vigorously and to soften criticism of Israel.According to news agency Reuters, he also tied the surge in antisemitic incidents to France’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state, arguing that such moves embolden extremists.As per BBC, Kushner’s claims echoed comments made earlier by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had also accused Macron of fuelling antisemitism through his stance on Palestinian statehood. Macron, however, has argued that recognising Palestine is essential for long-term peace and has simultaneously increased security at synagogues and Jewish centres.The episode comes at a sensitive time in Franco-American relations. According to AP, both governments have clashed recently over trade disputes, the future of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and their approaches to the war in Ukraine.Still, Macron held what was described as a “warm” meeting with Trump and other European leaders in Washington last week.France is home to Western Europe’s largest Jewish community, estimated at around 500,000 people, as well as a large Muslim population. Both groups have reported a rise in hate crimes since the Gaza conflict began, with the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory claiming more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to BBC.The White House has not commented on the row, but state department spokesperson Tommy Pigott defended Kushner on Sunday and was quoted by AP as saying, “Ambassador Kushner is our US government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role”.","US ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner, accused French government of failing to act against antisemitism.

JD Vance Heckled BRUTALLY In Public With Vulgar Couch Rumour On Camera | WATCH





US Vice President JD Vance has drawn widespread ridicule after suggesting that the Second World War ended through “negotiations,” while defending President Donald Trump’s push for a diplomatic settlement in Ukraine.Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Vance told host Kristen Welker, “This is how wars ultimately get settled. If you go back to World War II , if you go back to World War I, if you go back to every major conflict in human history, they all end with some kind of negotiations.”Critics were quick to call out his version of history. “Hitler killed himself and Germany surrendered. Japan got nuked. Do they teach history in Ohio?” one person wrote on X. Another added, “World War 2 ended with the exact opposite of a negotiation.” A third mocked: “Nothing like getting community noted.”Others piled on, “He didn’t really spend time in history class, did he? Or maybe he was just asleep.” Another bluntly said, “Brother, what sort of revisionist history are you preaching? Hitler killed himself.”Some also mocked the interview itself, with one comment reading: “The fact he has to explain this to her is embarrassing… a real journalist should know this.”As per HuffPost, Vance’s example overlooked the fact that Germany’s defeat came after Adolf Hitler’s suicide and the unconditional surrender signed on 7 May 1945. Japan followed suit after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, formally surrendering on 2 September 1945.Even his First World War reference faltered. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 was technically a negotiation, but by then, Germany had collapsed militarily and politically, with little bargaining power.During the exchange, Welker raised concerns that Trump’s approach could mean forcing Ukraine to give up territory seized by Russia, a scenario President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently rejected.Vance sidestepped, saying, “The Ukrainians are going to ultimately make the determination about where you draw the territorial lines in their own country.”According to Daily Beast, Vance added that America’s role was now to act as mediator rather than an “active party.” He argued, “If Ukrainians are willing to say something on territory that brings the conflict to a close, we’re not going to stop them. We’re also not going to force them, because it’s not our country.”While many mocked his World War II comparison, some online users defended Vance by noting Japan was allowed to keep its emperor and that post-war Germany was divided through Allied negotiations. “There were negotiations, it was just very one-sided,” one supporter commented.While many mocked his World War II comparison, some online users defended Vance by noting Japan was allowed to keep its emperor and that post-war Germany was divided through Allied negotiations. “There were negotiations, it was just very one-sided,” one supporter commented.Still, most criticism focused on his shaky history.

They were decimated with overwhelming military power.”","US Vice President JD Vance has drawn widespread ridicule after suggesting that the Second World War ended through “negotiations,” while defending President Donald Trump’s push for a diplomatic settlement in Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump has again claimed fighter jets were shot down during the India-Pakistan conflict in May, reiterating that his intervention had prevented what he described as a “potential nuclear war” between the two neighbours.Trump’s fresh statement comes just days after he said ""six or seven planes came down"" during the crisis. Back in July, he had claimed five aircraft were downed.However, he once again didn't specify whether these were Indian or Pakistani jets, or a combined tally.“I have stopped all of these wars. A big one would have been India and Pakistan,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with the South Korean president.He added: “The war with India and Pakistan was the next level that was going to be a nuclear war… They already shot down 7 jets — that was raging. I said, ‘You want to trade?

Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing more than 100 terrorists.The strikes triggered days of cross-border clashes, before a ceasefire was reached on May 10 after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a halt to hostilities.Trump has repeatedly — over three dozen times — credited himself with stopping the conflict.

‘President of Europe’ claim after high-level talks

Flag burning ban despite Supreme Court ruling

US President Donald Trump on Monday claimed that European leaders “jokingly” refer to him as the “President of Europe,” a remark that came just moments after he signed a controversial executive order making flag burning a criminal offence.“They jokingly call me the president of Europe,” Trump told reporters from the Oval Office. “Which is an honour. I like Europe. And I like those people. They’re good people. They’re great leaders.”Trump’s comments followed a high-stakes meeting in Washington last week, where he hosted seven European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to Trump, the gathering represented “38 European and other countries.”The meeting’s central agenda was persuading Trump to maintain US support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. It came just days after his private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska—their first face-to-face encounter since 2019.Alongside his remarks on Europe, Trump signed an executive order criminalizing the burning of the US flag.The move challenges a 1989 Supreme Court ruling that classified flag burning as protected free speech under the First Amendment.Calling the ruling from three decades ago “a very sad one,” Trump said the new order allows prosecutions if flag burning incites violence or public disorder. “Anyone found guilty could face one year in prison, with no early release,” he declared.Foreign nationals are also directly targeted under the order. Those found guilty could lose visas, be denied green cards or citizenship, and even face deportation.","President Donald Trump claims European leaders ‘jokingly’ refer to him as the ‘President of Europe,’ a remark that came just moments after he signed a controversial executive order making flag burning a criminal offence.

According to a probable cause affidavit reviewed by Idaho News 6 and PEOPLE, Delbert admitted he shot his daughter in the head inside the family’s home.Investigators say Delbert told them he had been planning since last year to kill himself and his three children. The plan, he claimed, unraveled after his eldest child was sent back to prison on a parole violation.Delbert also alleged that his brother, who lived in the same house, constantly bullied the children with insults like “loser” and “pedophile.” On the morning of the killing, Delbert said he walked to Onyx’s room and was startled when she opened the door. He then pulled the trigger.According to the affidavit, Delbert watched for nearly 20 minutes as his daughter gasped for breath before dying. Only after that, he told police, did he cover her body with a Pride flag, saying it was meant to “honor her” because it would have been deeply meaningful to her.The Canyon County Coroner’s Office later identified the victim as Hope “Onyx” Cornish. Her mother, Crystal Thompson, told News 19 she never imagined her children weren’t safe around Delbert. “She was a fiery one. She was just very stylish, and she was kind and loving,” she said.A GoFundMe set up by the family describes Onyx as a lively spirit whose memory continues to be celebrated.","Hope 'Onyx' Cornish, 18, was shot in the head in her Caldwell, Idaho, home on August 19.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

DHAKA: Pakistan on Sunday claimed it had twice settled the issue of the 1971 Liberation War genocide committed by the Pakistan army in which more than a million civilians were butchered.Visiting foreign minister of Pakistan, Ishaq Dar said the massacre of Bangla-speaking people in what then was eastern Pakistan and rapes of lakhs of women was settled twice in 1974 and early 2000s.The assertion generated shock because there is no evidence of Pakistan officially apologising for the crimes committed by its army, and was seen as an evidence of its resolve to achieve normalisation of ties on its own terms.Significantly, the Bangladesh interim govt did not specifically address Dar's claim, limiting itself to saying ""we have agreed"" to resolve the issue in the course of time."" There was no indication it was still insisting on an official apology which for decades was set as the minimum pre-requisite for starting the process of reconciliation. For Bangladesh, the other issues of concern are return of assets Pakistan seized after Bangladesh became an independent country, repatriation of stranded Pakistanis, and transfer of foreign aid meant for the 1970 cyclone victims.""On the matter of unresolved issues, what I want to say is that the first settlement took place in 1974,"" said Dar, who arrived in Dhaka on Saturday for a visit aimed at rebuilding ties with Bangladesh following the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina, whose father led the struggle for independence and who was a hardliner on the issue of official apology. ""General Pervez Musharraf came here and resolved the issue openly. As a result, the issue was resolved twice. Once in 1974, and again in the early 2000s,"" he said.Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said all ""unresolved"" issues were raised with Dar. ""We have agreed to resolve them to advance our bilateral relations further,"" Touhid told reporters after meeting Dar, who is the most senior leader from his country to visit Dhaka since 2012, after then Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""The issues accumulated over 54 years cannot be solved overnight. But we have agreed to address them over the due course of time,"" he added.Dar said Pakistan will provide advanced medical treatment, including limb replacement for 40 individuals, including students, injured during the ""July Uprising"" - the movement that led to Awami League govt's ouster last year.He also called on chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and their discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation, according to Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs.Bangladesh foreign affairs ministry said, ""The meeting took place in a spirit of warmth and goodwill, reflecting the brotherly relations between the countries and their shared desire to augmenting engagement and cooperation.""",Pakistan claims it has settled issue of 1971 Liberation War genocide.

Sri Lanka's jailed former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Colombo National Hospital on Saturday, a day after being charged with misusing government funds for foreign travel.The deputy director-general of hospital Rukshan Bellana said that Wickremesinghe was reportedly severely dehydrated and required close monitoring. The 76-years-old ex-president was remanded in custody on Friday night.""He has to be closely observed and treated for acute dehydration to prevent serious complications,"" Bellana said. ""He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when he was brought in.""Bellana added that the former president's condition was ""stable.""A prison official said that Wickremesinghe was taken to Sri Lanka's main state-run hospital as his condition deteriorated and the prison medical facility was not equipped to treat him, as reported by news agency AFP.Earlier, opposition lawmakers visiting Wickremesinghe in prison reported that he remained in good spirits. Opposition parties have accused the government of detaining him out of fear he could return to power.Wickremesinghe, who lost the presidential election in September to Anura Kumara Dissanayake , has remained politically active despite holding no official position.He was arrested on Friday as part of President Dissanayake’s campaign against corruption in Sri Lanka, which is recovering from its worst economic crisis in 2022.Nalin Bandara, an opposition MP from Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party said Wickremesinghe urged unity to challenge the current government. ""What the former president says is that we should get onto a common stage to fight the oppression of the new government,"" Bandara said.The former Sri Lankan leader United National Party (UNP) also said the government acted out of fear of his political influence. UNP General Secretary Thalatha Athukorala told reporters, ""They fear he might return to power, and that is why this action.""Wickremesinghe is accused of using state funds for a private trip to Britain in September 2023 while returning from the G77 summit in Havana and the UN General Assembly in New York.The alleged offences carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine up to three times the misappropriated amount, estimated at 16.6 million rupees ($55,000).His two-day trip to the UK was to attend the conferral of an honorary professorship on his wife, Maithree, by the University of Wolverhampton.

"A wartime mass grave in Sri Lanka yields a baby bottle, children's clothes and 141 skeletons",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/a-wartime-mass-grave-in-sri-lanka-yields-a-baby-bottle-childrens-clothes-and-141-skeletons/articleshow/123443088.cms,"Senthilvel Sothiladchumi, an ethnic Sri Lankan Tamil, center, whose son went missing during the Sri Lankan civil war, cries as she leaves the site of a mass grave where authorities exhibited unearthed belongings in an effort to secure the identities of the victims, in Chemmani, Sri Lanka, Aug. 5, 2025. (AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

A British Airways flight attendant was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London. Described as “sweating” and “babbling,” he became agitated and was stood down by the flight’s manager after failing to assist with pre-flight safety checks.A subsequent blood test showed that Haden Pentecost, 41, had both methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system, reported the BBC.After complaining of stomach pain and saying he needed to change clothes, Pentecost locked himself inside a toilet. A colleague later discovered him there and, unaware of his state, before dressing him and moving him to an empty seat, the court heard.A health professional was called after the flight captain spoke to the flight attendant.Pentecost showed dilated pupils and an elevated heart rate, requiring checks every 20 minutes until the flight landed at Heathrow. Paramedics took him to the hospital, where a blood test was conducted.Witnesses described him as incoherent and erratic, muttering meaningless phrases. While reports suggest he had previously been investigated for unspecified conduct, this was his most serious breach yet, as cited by Aviation A2Z.He has since been dismissed by the Airways, and investigations are underway.He appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Friday and pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The attendant from Basingstoke was granted bail ahead of sentencing at Isleworth Crown Court at a later date.He was reportedly employed by the Airways in 2018.","British Airways flight attendant Haden Pentecost, 41, was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London.

UK government could introduce new laws to bar Criminals in England and Wales from pubs, sports grounds and concerts under new government plans, aimed at giving judges powers to impose tougher community sentences.Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood said “should remind all offenders that, under this government, crime does not pay.”""I am clear that if you break our laws, for whatever crime, you should lose your liberty – whether you are serving your sentence inside prison, or outside it. That’s why this Government will give courts new powers to hand down tough community sentences that restrict the freedoms of offenders outside of jail too"", Mirror UK reported.The proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones. The rules could also apply to prisoners released on licence, with drug testing extended to all those leaving prison, not only those with prior substance misuse.Currently, judges can impose limited bans linked to specific offences, such as football banning orders for crimes inside stadiums.The new plan would allow such bans to be applied to any offence.“When criminals break society's rules, they must be punished. These new punishments should remind all offenders that crime does not pay,” Mahmood said, stressing that the public expects the government to do “everything in its power to keep Britain safe.”The measures are part of Labour’s wider push to tackle prison overcrowding. In June, the government began transferring inmates to lower security jails to ease pressure on the system.Earlier this month, Sky News reported that the prison system had been close to collapse several times between autumn 2023 and summer 2024. The review pointed to a systemic problem causing recurring capacity crises over the last 18 years.","Proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones.

An on-duty officer who was caught on camera stealing a woman’s underwear during a home search in September last year has been jailed.The officer, identified as Marcin Zielinski, 47, serving with Hertfordshire Police, conducted the Section 32 search.CCTV footage from the woman’s home from last year shows Zielinski slipping a pair of underwear into his back pocket before walking out of the room. The woman released the footage on Monday after the officer was sentenced to four months in prison for the corrupt and improper use of police power and privileges.""Zielinski has let down the public of Hertfordshire, the police service as a whole, and his former colleagues, who act with professionalism and integrity,” Genna Telfer, the assistant chief constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary, was quoted as saying by the BBC.""His criminal behaviour damages the reputation of policing and represents a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police service stands,"" she said.The woman said she felt so “violated” by the incident that she discarded all her underwear and the chest of drawers, which had become a constant reminder of the distressing footage.“I'm constantly thinking, what did he want them for? Why did he take them? What's he going to do with them? How many more people has he done it to?” the woman was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.On the night of the incident, the woman was arrested over an unrelated matter but later released without charges. While she was in custody, her partner came across the ring doorbell footage and was shocked by what he witnessed.""On the footage he signals to the other guy, 'I've searched this room, go and search the other room’. So he sent the other officer out and that's when he proceeded to open the drawer and stick them in his back pocket,"" the woman’s partner was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.The woman feels that Zielinski’s sentence was too lenient and that he should serve a longer term in jail.""Originally I thought it was just going to get a suspended sentence, because I really did not think they were going to take it seriously. But I do think he does deserve to see the law from the other side. He can't just have the power trip to get away with it,"" she said.","Hertfordshire Police officer Marcin Zielinski, 47, was caught on camera stealing a woman's underwear during a home search in September last year.

LONDON: A man has been convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent for his role in the shooting of a nine-year-old Keralite girl when she was eating ice-cream with her family in a restaurant in Dalston.The girl was hit in the head by the first of six bullets fired from a passing stolen motorcycle at a Turkish restaurant at 9.20 pm on May 29, 2024. She was caught up in a gangland shooting.Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men — Mustafa Kiziltan (35) Kenan Aydogdu (45) and Nasser Ali (44) — who were sitting outside Evin Restaurant. The three men were the intended targets. All four were taken to hospital for emergency surgery.The men had affiliations with Hackney Turks and the shooting was ordered by the Tottenham Turks, a rival gang, the court heard. Both gangs are responsible for importing most of the UK’s heroin.The girl has been left permanently injured with a titanium plate in her skull and a bullet still in her brain. She was in hospital for three months and will continue to have physical and cognitive difficulties throughout her life.Her parents hail from Kerala’s Ernakulam district and moved to Birmingham three years ago for work. Following the verdict her mother said: “This was not just an accident — even if our daughter was not the intended target, those responsible were still attempting to take lives, it is brutal and inhumane. We live with this pain every day, knowing nothing will ever be the same for our family.”Riley denied the charges but was convicted on Monday following a three-week trial. He did not pull the trigger but scoped out the area over several days, which included drinking pina coladas at the bar opposite. On the night of the attack, he travelled past the scene several times in a stolen car to ensure the targets were present and helped the gunman evade capture. The gunman and firearm have never been found. Detectives are offering up to £15,000 (Rs 17 lakh) for information that leads to the gunman. Riley, who is not a member of Tottenham Turks, refused to name the gunman or the person who ordered the shooting fearing for his safety.He will be sentenced on Sep 12.","Javon Riley (33) of Tottenham, London, was also found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of attempting to murder three men.

Seconds later, the chopper slammed into the water and split apart, creating a massive splash.Miraculously, both the pilot and the onboard firefighter emerged unharmed. The prefecture of Finistère confirmed that the men were able to exit the helicopter on their own and reach the shore safely.Witnesses described the crash as sudden and terrifying. David, who saw the incident, was quoted by the Sun as saying, “It dipped way too low and was descending fast. I thought it was going to explode, break into pieces. Once it flipped, it went in all directions.”Authorities praised the courage and composure of the crew, highlighting the risks firefighters take daily to protect lives and property. The helicopter had just completed 27 water drops earlier that day to protect a 10-hectare area from flames threatening homes near Rosporden.An investigation has been launched to determine the exact cause of the crash, though firefighting operations resumed immediately with a replacement aircraft.The incident comes amid France’s ongoing battle with unprecedented wildfires that have scorched areas larger than Paris, killing at least one person and injuring 13 others, including 11 firefighters. Thousands of personnel and dozens of aircraft continue to fight the blazes that have devastated the southern parts of the country.","A water-bomber helicopter crashed into a lake in Rosporden, France, during a firefighting mission.

Training to defend Estonia

Estonia invests 'a great deal in security'

Acts of sabotage and GPS jamming

Kaliningrad is a 'dagger pointed at Europe'

The Home Cafe Days, or Kodukohvikute paevad in Estonian, are the summer highlight on the island of Hiiumaa. Every August, the residents of Estonia's second-largest Baltic Sea island open up their homes for three days and offer up home-baked cakes, home-smoked fish and home-brewed beer. They celebrate their short summer amid children's laughter and pop music.Ave Ungro, 44, thinks the festival is ""extremely important,"" especially now in times of war. ""It helps us Estonians stick together: Celebrating together, talking, thinking about the future,"" she told DW.She said that Kodukohvikute paevad was as important as the shooting lessons provided by the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization, or Naiskodukaitse. Ungro has been a member since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.""Like most Estonians, probably, I was in shock on February 24, 2022. Mainly because of the realization that the life we had known so far could no longer go on in the same way,"" she said.Ungro decided to shape her new life and prepare her family, her island and her country for a possible Russian attack.Since then, the speech therapist has spent 48 hours a year training with the Naiskodukaitse and has already completed five different programs: Safety, first aid, military skills, field catering and the history of the Estonian volunteer defense league.""I did pick up a weapon in the military part,"" she said. ""But I didn't shoot once.""She hopes that she will never have to make use of her military training. If the worst happens, she would prefer to be involved in evacuations.The Naiskodukaitse was founded in 1927, banned during the Soviet era and reestablished after Estonia regained independence in 1991. It is part of the Kaitseliit, a larger volunteer defense league comprised of well-trained armed civilians intended to support the regular armed forces in times of war. Both units are accountable to the Estonian Defense Ministry.Ungro said she's not afraid of a Russian attack. She knows that her island in the Baltic Sea is strategically important, since it lies between the Russian city of St. Petersburg and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and could potentially be invaded, but she said that despite what certain Western media outlets had reported, there was no feeling of fear.Marek Kohv from the International Center for Defence and Security also doubts that Hiiumaa could become a second Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. He told DW that Hiiumaa and Estonia in 2025 could not be compared with Crimea and Ukraine in 2014.He said Estonia might be a small country, but what was important was ""that we invest a great deal in security.""Indeed, Estonia, an EU member, already invests 3.4% of its GDP in defense. This is set to rise to 5.4% by 2029, breaking a record among NATO states.Kohv explained that Estonia's culture of self-defense was deeply rooted. ""And we have regional allies such as Finland, the new NATO member, but also other Baltic states such as Lithuania and Latvia, as well as Poland, the military superpower in Europe.""He added that Estonia's membership of NATO was crucial — thanks to Article 5 and the principle of collective defense, any attack on Estonia would be considered an attack on NATO as a whole, and other armies would be implicated.He also pointed out that Western military technology was superior to Russian technology. He said the idea that Russia could attack Estonia with nuclear weapons was an empty threat, considering that the proximity of St. Petersburg, which would also be affected by radioactivity in the event of a strike.What analysts say is of more acute importance than a theoretical Russian attack on Baltic states are the very real acts of Russian sabotage, such as repeated damage to undersea communication cables or the jamming of GPS signals that can cause aircraft to disappear from the radar.This happened to two planes flying from Finland to Estonia in April 2024. Both had to return to Helsinki after their GPS signals were seemingly interfered with.Ships in the Baltic Sea have also been affected — and these problems are increasing. Western intelligence services suspect the jamming activities to be controlled from nearby Kaliningrad.Russia has a lot of military equipment stored there, including nuclear-capable Iskander missiles, said political scientist Sergey Sukhankin from the Saratoga Foundation, a US-based nonprofit.Calling Kaliningrad, where he was born, a ""dagger pointed at Europe,"" he explained that not only was the enclave located between the EU states of Lithuania and Poland but it was once ""a bastion of the Soviet military, one of the most militarized places in the world."" Today, Kaliningrad is regaining that status.Back at Home Cafe Days, Ungro isn't thrilled about her regional neighbors and acknowledges how serious the acts of sabotage are, but she would not dream of leaving her ""magical"" island.After the festival, she showed DW her ""secret spot"" on the coast, a headland surrounded almost entirely by water on all sides.""Look, a sea eagle,"" she called out. ""What a beautiful place! So many birds. It's so quiet here. That's the beauty of Hiiumaa.

Rigorous training at Versailles

M

ore European countries stepping up





Law school did not teach Constance how to march, identify radio call signs or lie belly down on warm concrete, pointing her rifle at an imaginary enemy. Instead, the Sorbonne University student got her military primer from a Paris-area regiment, during the summer break.""I think it's really important to protect our country — especially in the very complicated context we're going through,"" said the second-year law student of her two-week initiation into the military reserves. At the French army's request, her last name and those of others in the story are not being published.""I think the army is the best way to know how to work together,"" she added.More than two decades after France ended compulsory military service, tens of thousands of French are now applying for the reserves, hoping for a chance to serve their country, at least part time. The number of operational reservists has soared over the past decade, from just 28,000 in 2014, to more than 46,000 today. The army has absorbed more than half of them, with the rest roughly split between the navy and the air force.By 2035, the government wants to more than double those numbers — to 105,000 reservists, or about one for every two active servicemen/women — and offer new opportunities for young people to volunteer.That goal falls in line with President Emmanuel Macron's plans to sharply boost investment in the military, to reach €64 billion ($75 billion) in 2027, twice the level of 2017, when he took office.Backdropping the uptick, and mirroring similar European efforts, is growing alarm over an increasingly aggressive Russia — and doubts whether the United States under President Donald Trump will come to Europe's defense.""Never...has our freedom been so threatened,"" Macron said in a televised address in July. ""We need to accelerate efforts for our reserve. We need to give youth a new framework to serve.""Retired French Vice-Admiral Patrick Chevallereau called Macron's push ""a good move"" — even though he cautioned the government's overall budget must still get through French parliament.""Not only do we need more people,"" added Chevallereau, now an analyst for the Royal United Services Institute, the London-based defense and security think tank, ""but we need more specialized people in certain key domains"" including drones and information technology.The task of training the new reservists falls to places like the 24th Infantry Regiment in Versailles, located in a sprawling military neighborhood about 4 kilometers from the famous chateau.""Some want to discover the military world and see whether they want to join full-time,"" said Lt. Amelie, who headed the latest training session. ""Some come because of the challenge of adapting to another world, or because it's too late to join the active military.""Like most members of the 24th Infantry, Amelie is a reservist herself; she works as a customs officer in her civilian life. She spent her summer overseeing an intense, two-week primer on army life.Aged 17-57, her 51 recruits spend marathon days in training, waking up at 6 a.m. and often going to bed at midnight.""They're learning to use and carry their weapons safely, march together, how to use a compass and communication equipment,"" Amelie said of the trainees, ticking off some of the requirements of this initial boot camp. ""We work on all the combat techniques the regiment uses.""On a recent morning, the group marched and sang in cadence, practiced manipulating their rifles and, later, went through live-fire training in a bunker-like building.""The training is really rigorous,"" said Constance, the law student, who added she knows other Sorbonne University students who have also gone through it. ""We don't have the same age, the same jobs, the same studies, but we learn how to work together.""Like Constance, 23-year-old engineer Gabriel applied for the reserves because he is worried about his country's future. ""As a soldier, I am not going to comment on the political or ideological component,"" he said, echoing other reservists who declined to discuss Russia's threat openly. ""But war is at the border of Europe, and it's a signal for us to step up.""Another wake-up call for the young engineer was the 2015 Bataclan terrorist attack in Paris.""Something clicked inside me,"" Gabriel said. ""I realized the peaceful time I'd known and grew up with was gone. And I thought, 'I'm going to step up and do my part.'""Efforts to beef up military manpower are happening elsewhere in Europe, as the region races to respond to growing security concerns. A report earlier this year by think tanks Bruegel and Germany's Kiel Institute estimated Europe could need 300,000 more troops in the short term to deter Russian aggression, without US support.Some countries have already stepped up. Over the past decade, Lithuania, Sweden and Latvia have reintroduced compulsory service. Poland has announced plans to offer military training to 100,000 civilians yearly. Germany is also on a recruitment drive, and — with the initial response underwhelming — Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has warned that conscription may be reinstated if too few people volunteer.In France, by contrast, polls suggest strong support for growing the military. An IPSOS-CESI survey earlier this year showed 86% of French people backed armed service; more than half approved of mandatory service. Another poll found half of young French respondents were ready to join the army, if there was war.""I think that people understand that they may have to protect what they cherish,"" said defense analyst Chevallereau. ""The increase of the military reserve can be a way to reinforce the link between the young generation and the military.""Founded in the 17th century, Versailles' 24th Regiment has said it is getting a wave of applications for its training sessions. For every 100 candidates, just 40 are selected. Those who graduate can eventually spend up to 60 or more days a year serving in the reserve. The pay for a reservist is modest — ranging from €40 to €200 net daily, depending on the grade.Not everyone makes it through even basic training. Of the initial 61 selected for the 24th Regiment's latest session, 10 dropped out. ""Some dropped out at the beginning of the mission, because they didn't have time,"" said trainer Amelie. ""Others realized it wasn't for them, once they had weapons in their hands.""After graduation, her group will spend months undergoing further training. Once they are deemed ready, many will likely join countrywide patrols under Operation Sentinelle, a security operation launched after the 2015 terrorist attacks in France — and which provided security for last year's Olympic Games. Those with special qualifications might also be deployed overseas.Another trainee, Betrand, a father of two, has signed up for five years in the reserves after he finishes his training. In his 30s, he recalled learning about the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.""We've also had terrible attacks in France,"" he said. ""I thought it was my duty as a father to defend my country.""As a municipal employee in a town outside of Paris, Betrand believes he's already serving his nation as a civilian. ""Now,"" he added, ""I'll be serving it as a combatant.""","Number of operational reservists in France has soared over the past decade. The army has absorbed more than half of them, with the rest roughly split between the navy and the air force.

MADRID: A 16-day heatwave Spain suffered this month was ""the most intense on record"", the national meteorological agency said on Sunday.With forest fires still burning across northern and western Spain, the AEMET meteorological agency said provisional readings for the August 3-18 heatwave exceeded the last record, set in July 2022, and showed an average temperature 4.6C higher than previous events.AEMET said a 10-day period from August 8 to August 17, was the hottest 10 consecutive days recorded in Spain since ""at least 1950"".The August heatwave exacerbated tinderbox conditions that have fuelled wildfires which have killed four people and forced thousands out of their homes.Four people have also died in fires in Portugal, where emergency services are still struggling to control the blazes.More than 1,100 deaths in Spain have been linked to the August heatwave, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the Carlos III Health Institute.The institute had already said that 1,060 deaths in July could be attributed to excess heat, a 50 percent rise on the figure for July 2024.Since it began keeping records in 1975, AEMET has registered 77 heatwaves in Spain, with six going 4C or more above the average. Five of those have been since 2019.Scientists say climate change is driving longer, more intense and more frequent heatwaves worldwide.The agency said that it is ""a scientific fact that current summers are hotter than in previous decades"".""Each summer is not always going to be hotter than the previous one, but there is a clear trend towards much more extreme summers.

Dividing up Africa from Berlin



Who was Anton Wilhelm Amo?



The long journey to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse







""Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names,"" political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW after it was announced on Friday that a central Berlin street will not have its racist name changed after all. The road had been slated to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German Enlightenment philosopher, who in 1734 became the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate.That was in 2020. At the time, the district council of Berlin-Mitte had approved the renaming, but before it was implemented, residents filed a lawsuit against it.But five years later, in July this year, the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Signs had already been installed, and the change was to be officialized through a symbolic unveiling on Saturday, August 23, which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Though the group ""Pro Mohrenstraße"" made a last-ditch legal attempt to block the name change, the Berlin-Brandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.Several civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or ""Moor"" Street (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse), and the U-Bahn station of the same name.Moor, in its Greek roots, means dark or black, but also ""stupid or primitive,"" Aikins said.M-Strasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city, steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace, which oversaw colonial forays into Africa, and near the former chancellor's residence and venue for the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlin-based British-Ugandan writer Musa Okwonga, the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference ""discussed how they might divide up Africa."" The conference kickstarted Germany's genocidal colonial rule in Namibia.The M-word's overt racist connotations further derive from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as ""court moors"" to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. ""The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day,"" wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize Berlin-Mitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in current-day Ghana (then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast), which existed from 1682 to 1721.Anton Wilhelm Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel in 1707, the year M-Strasse was named.Encouraged to study by the Duke, who paid for his education, Amo went on to become the first African-born scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.Despite Amo's displacement, he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amo's thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled ""The Rights of Blacks in Europe,"" which looked at the legal rights of People of Color in the continent.It is said that Amo learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena, but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany, yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.The naming of Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholar's work ""as a philosopher and legal scholar, and the professional context in which he worked,"" wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal, EUIdeas. ""German and international historians, philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amo’s work,"" she added.But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance, says Andrea-Vicky Amankwaa-Birago, a Berlin-based cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana.""This renaming signals a change in how we remember — placing Black history, achievement, and resilience at the center,"" she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication, Medium.The M-Strasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991, in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim, a poet of Ghanaian descent who co-founded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book ""Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out.""Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s, she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name, which in her view stood for the fact that Germany's Black community was not included in the country's essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010, a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim, who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization, the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, who in the late 17th century founded the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in Ghana.","Anton Wilhelm Amo was the first African-born scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.

?

Peacekeeping through trade

Pipeline explosions lead to many theories

What could happen next?





Three years after the Nord Stream gas pipeline was blown up in the Baltic Sea, the first suspect has been apprehended. Acting on a European arrest warrant issued by the German Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, Italian authorities arrested a Ukrainian national suspected of coordinating the operation. German Minister of Justice Stefanie Hubig described it as a ""very impressive achievement.""According to the Federal Prosecutor's Office, the man, whose name was given as Serhii K.*, belonged to the group that attached the explosive devices to the pipeline close to the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022. The sailing yacht that was used for the operation departed from Rostock, Germany, and the Ukrainian man who has now been apprehended is believed to have been one of the coordinators. Italian police arrested him near Rimini on the Adriatic coast on August 21.The suspect will now be brought to Germany to face a judge.Ukraine has denied involvement. However, if Serhii K. is indeed behind the bombing, one particularly sensitive question is whether he had connections to the Ukrainian government or military leadership, and whether he may have even been acting on their behalf.This could seriously strain Ukrainian-German relations and call into question Germany's continued military and financial support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.This is precisely what politician Sahra Wagenknecht said recently to the news agency Reuters.""It is simply absurd that Germany is spending billions on aid for Ukraine but has never demanded any explanation from Zelenskyy. Questions about possible compensation should also be raised,"" said Wagenknecht, who has repeatedly opposed sanctions against Russia.The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is a new splinter party that failed to win representation in the Bundestag in the February general election.Green Party politician and intelligence expert Konstantin von Notz warned against conspiracy theories and called for greater trust in the rule of law.After the arrest, Justice Minister Hubig emphasized that Germany's stance on Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine would remain unchanged: ""We stand firmly with Ukraine politically.""While Denmark and Sweden closed their investigations back in February 2024, Germany remains the only country still officially pursuing the case.Nord Stream is a Russian-German mega-project that had a lot of opponents from the very beginning, including Poland, the US, the Baltic states, and, especially since the start of the war, Ukraine. That is why one question has remained central to the investigations: Who stands to benefit?A declaration of intent to build the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was signed in 2005 by the German government under then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder (SPD) and the Russian government under President Vladimir Putin . The pipeline would bring Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea, bypassing transit countries. Initial proposals for the idea were made as early as the 1990s.The following year, Nord Stream AG was founded to plan and implement the project. The Russian company Gazprom and several European energy suppliers were involved, as other European countries besides Germany were also interested in receiving gas supplies.Construction of Nord Stream 1 began in 2010. The twin pipelines, each 1,224 kilometers long (761 miles), connect Vyborg in Russia with Lubmin in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The pipeline went into operation a year later.Planning for Nord Stream 2 began in 2013. The new project consisted of two additional 1,250-kilometer-long pipelines that would essentially run parallel to the existing pipelines. The first contracts for Nord Stream 2 were signed in 2015. Once again, the Russian state-owned company Gazprom and several European energy providers were involved. Just a year earlier, Russia had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. For then-Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), that was no reason to stop the project.From the beginning, Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states voiced growing concerns about the security risks the pipeline presented. The EU also issued warnings.After Donald Trump was elected for his first term as president in the US, opposition to Nord Stream also grew. Trump warned Germany about becoming too dependent on Russian energy supplies.But the German government ignored all concerns and not only portrayed Nord Stream as the answer to Europe's energy security needs, but also as a form of peacekeeping through trade.Construction of Nord Stream 2 began in 2018 and was completed in 2021. But due to Russia's attack on Ukraine on February 22, 2022, then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspended the certification of Nord Stream 2, effectively halting the approval process.However, Nord Stream 1 continued to supply gas to European states, although in smaller amounts due to EU sanctions against Russia.But then, allegedly because of maintenance work, Russia shut down Nord Stream 1. Gazprom blamed a defective turbine for the continuation of further delays.On September 26, 2022, both pipelines of Nord Stream 1 and one of the two lines of Nord Stream 2 blew up near the Danish island of Bornholm. Germany, Denmark and Sweden launched investigations.Over time, various theories emerged about who might be behind the attacks. US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh claimed that the US and Norway were responsible for blowing up the pipelines. However, he was unable to provide any evidence.One Ukrainian suspect — Volodymyr Z., reportedly a diving instructor — was last known to be in Poland as of August 2024, but evaded arrest by fleeing to Ukraine. The Polish prosecutor's office attributed the failure to a procedural delay caused by a formal error: They claimed German authorities had not entered his name into the register for individuals sought under a European arrest warrant.It was not until August 21, 2025, that the first suspect was arrested by the Italian Carabinieri on the Adriatic coast after the German Federal Prosecutor's Office issued a warrant for the Ukrainian Serhii K.Nord Stream still remains important and could become part of a US-Russian agreement to end the war in Ukraine.Back in March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on state television: ""Nord Stream is being discussed.""","Italian authorities arrested a Ukrainian national suspected of coordinating the operation. German Minister of Justice Stefanie Hubig described it as a ""very impressive achievement"" The man, whose name was given as Serhii K.*, belonged to the group that attached the explosive devices to the pipeline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123467588,imgsize-130425,width-400,resizemode-4/123467588.jpg"
