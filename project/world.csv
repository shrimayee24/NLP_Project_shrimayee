NEW DELHI: Finding Pakistan teaming up with China to push its line on terrorism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers' meet at Qingdao, India Thursday refused to sign the proposed joint statement as it would've diluted its consistent stand on the scourge endangering regional peace and stability.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as defence minister Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.Also read: ‘Proposal objected by one particular country,’ MEA on why Rajnath Singh refused to sign SCO statement There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it, sources told TOI.Pakistan was especially keen to include Jaffar Express hijacking in its restive Balochistan province in March in the joint document. Pakistan frequently accuses India of fomenting the ongoing insurgency for greater autonomy and independence in Balochistan.India, on its part, has consistently rejected all such ""baseless"" allegations.""The Indian delegation led by Rajnath Singh had serious objections to the draft joint statement and its language, which reeked of double standards in dealing with a serious issue like terrorism,"" a source said. External affairs ministry spokesperson said, ""India wanted its concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country (Pakistan) and, thus, the statement was not adopted. ""Both India and Pakistan in 2017 became full members of SCO, which also includes Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Belarus.Speaking at the meet, Singh said peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. ""Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" Singh said.In a clear reference to Pakistan, he said, ""Some countries use crossborder terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations.""The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of UN designated terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) based in Pakistan, carried out the heinous attack in Pahalgam on April 22, in which 26 civilians were shot dead after being profiled on the basis of religious identity. ""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further crossborder terrorist attacks, India on May 7 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross-border terrorist infrastructure,"" Singh said.India's zero tolerance for terrorism was manifested through its actions, he said. ""This includes our right to defend ourselves against terrorism. We have shown that epicentres of terrorism are no longer safe... India reaffirms its resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" he added.","Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.

Poll Should the international community take a stronger stance against TTP activities? Yes, to curb terrorism effectively No, current measures are sufficient

NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan.

Bombay HC orders preservation of dead man's semen on mother's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-orders-preservation-of-dead-mans-semen-on-mothers-plea/articleshow/122100087.cms,"MUMBAI: Bombay high court has ordered a fertility centre to preserve the frozen semen of a deceased unmarried man pending hearing of a petition by his mother who wants to use it to continue the family line. The fertility centre had refused to release it to her.The woman's son had chosen to preserve his semen during chemotherapy. Justice Manish Pitale said if the semen sample is destroyed before the matter is decided, the purpose of the petition would be ""frustrated"".The mother's petition said when her son was diagnosed with cancer, the oncologist treating him had advised him to freeze his semen as chemotherapy caused fertility problems.Her son, without consulting family members, however, ticked an option to destroy the sample in the event of his death. He passed away on Feb 16 intestate.On Feb 24 and 26, emails were sent by the woman to Nova IVF Fertility Centre requesting them not to dispose of the semen sample and to provide access to transfer the sample to a Gujarat-based IVF centre for future course of action. On Feb 27, Nova declined to release the sample and asked the mother to obtain authorisation from court as per Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act and Rules.On April 1, the Maharashtra public health secretary wrote asking her to approach the national board. On May 6, the Union ministry of health and family welfare rejected her request. Thereafter, the mother moved HC. The sample was meant for storage till July 31.Her petition, submitted through advocates Nikhilesh Pote and Tanmay Jadhav, said the young man's family comprises only female relatives.

""Now the petitioner has lost S at a young age of 21...the petitioner intends to continue the family legacy through the deceased son's semen.""It said when her son was in a critical state and realised he did not have much time, he told his aunt to ""do something with the sperm and create his children who would take care of my mom and family"". Also, it is a settled legal position that ""sperm constitutes property and the parents are the legal heirs of the deceased son.""It said the form signed by the deceased youth had two columns - to 'perish' the sample or hand it over to the wife (if married).

Family wakes up to surprise visitor in bedroom: A tiger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/family-wakes-up-to-surprise-visitor-in-bedroom-a-tiger/articleshow/122080630.cms,"RANCHI/SILLI/PURULIA/KOLKATA: ""Bhagwan Krishna ne aaj bacha liya (Lord Krishna has saved us today),"" said farmer Puran Chand Mahto, 55of Mardu village in Ranchi district's Silli block, still unable to believe his luck at being alive to tell the tale of how he and his family - his three daughters and a relative, who is a minor - slept peacefully while a tiger silently crouched in a corner of the same room.Around 4.30am Wednesday, Puran was getting ready for the day. As he stepped out of his three room house into the courtyard, he asked his daughter, Savita, a Class IX student, to bring out the cattle for grazing. Moments later, her shrieks sent a chill down his spine.Savita had found a seven-foot-long tiger inside their room - which had only one door - and screamed: ""Baba, baag... (Father, tiger)!""""All hell broke loose as my two other daughters and the relative were still sleeping inside,"" Puran told TOI over the phone. His wife and son were away to attend a wedding in a nearby village in West Bengal.""Savita rushed inside briefly to wake up the others. I also went in and asked the girls to run to the other side of the room,"" Puran said.""Soon, the tiger jumped into another room through a window that had no grille and stood there. I then asked the girls to run out of the house. As soon as we escaped, we locked the iron door from outside and called for help,"" Puran added.The big cat may have sneaked into the house early in the morning when Puran had gone to the courtyard leaving the door open. Instances of leopards and other wild animals straying into houses had earlier been reported in Jharkhand, but it was the first time that a tiger had strayed into someone's house.The news sent district authorities into a tizzy, and the forest department rushed a team to control the situation. Senior forest officials arrived at the spot to oversee the operation. The house was covered with nets, and prohibitory orders were imposed to check any gathering at the site. A local police officer told TOI that they had roped in additional personnel to prevent any unwanted incident. ""There was a crowd of nearly 1,000 villagers. .. it was a big task for us to ensure their safety,"" the officer said.Around 4pm, a special team from Palamu Tiger Reserve reached the village, and aided by personnel from Ranchi forest division, managed to trap the tiger - a male aged about five years. The team placed a cage, fitted to a rescue van, in front of the door and lured the big cat out. ""Even before placing the bait, the tiger entered the cage and got trapped. It was then tranquillized so that it wouldn't get injured. We had to dart it twice. Around 6.45pm, we left for Ranchi's Bhagwan Birsa Zoo where the tiger will undergo tests,"" an official said.Jharkhand's chief wildlife warden Paritosh Upadhyay said, ""If the tiger is fit, we will release it in a nearby tiger reserve with a radio collar in consultation with the National Tiger Conservation Authority.""The village is located on the banks of the Subarnarekha river, about 60km from Ranchi city and barely 500m from Purulia in West Bengal.

SC alarmed by Karnataka HC's retro use of 'grounds of arrest' order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-alarmed-by-karnataka-hcs-retro-use-of-grounds-of-arrest-order/articleshow/122100746.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday realised that its well-meaning rulings could cause huge complications in criminal law processes as it found that Karnataka high court had released a murder accused two years after his arrest as police had not informed him in writing the grounds of arrest as mandated by SC in Oct 2023.Appearing for Karnataka govt, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra told a bench led by Justice K V Viswanathan that SC rulings operate prospectively unless specifically directed for its retrospective application. He said the man was arrested on Feb 17, 2023, and was remanded to custody the same day in a murder case . The chargesheet has been filed and he is facing trial, Luthra said.However, nearly one-and-a-half years after SC in Pankaj Bansal case ruled on Oct 3, 2023 that investigating agencies must communicate in writing the grounds of arrest to the person being taken into custody, the murder accused moved Karnataka HC on March 22 this year questioning his arrest due to non-communication of the grounds of arrest in writing by relying on the SC ruling.Relying on subsequent rulings of SC reiterating the principle enunciated in Pankaj Bansal case, HC quashed his arrest but asked him to appear before the investigating officer, cooperate in the probe, not to threaten or tamper with witnesses, not to get involved in similar offences and not to leave the territory of the police station of Arsikere town without IO's permission.Justice Viswanathan said this could have a huge repercussion on thousands of arrests by police across states prior to pronouncement of the judgment in Pankaj Bansal case.""We are worried such a course of action, as adopted by Karnataka HC, will have a nation-wide implication and thousands of accused, arrested prior to Oct 3, 2023, may rush to courts seeking annulment of their arrests,"" he said.The bench noted that a similar question was pending judgment before a bench led by CJI B R Gavai, which had reserved verdict two months ago on April 22 on a petition filed by Mihir Rajesh Shah who had challenged his arrest alleging that the grounds of arrest were not communicated to him in writing by police.CJI Gavai and Justice A G Masih had raised two questions: Whether in every IPC case, it is mandatory to furnish grounds of arrest before or immediately after the arrest. And, whether the mandate could be optional in exceptional cases where it is impossible to provide grounds of arrest immediately on arrest.Referring to Mihir Shah's case, Justice Viswanathan said since the judgment could be expected after July 15 and could lay down guidelines regarding communication of grounds of arrest, it would be better to post the Karnataka case for hearing on July 18.Justice Viswanathan's apprehension was fully reflected in CJI Gavai's views, as before reserving verdict in Mihir Shah's case, he had observed, ""Imagine someone is shooting people in public. Should police take him into custody or wait to prepare grounds of arrest to be served on him prior to that? Our judgments (making it mandatory for police to furnish grounds of arrest in writing) have been grossly misused.""",Supreme Court realised that its well-meaning rulings could cause huge complications in criminal law processes.

'Garbage Of Lies': Mamata's Scathing Attack At Modi's 'Nirmam' Swipe, Dares To 'Hold Elections'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of acting as a ""stooge of the BJP"" and making a “backdoor attempt to implement the NRC” under the guise of a special revision of electoral rolls.""This looks to be more dangerous than the NRC,"" she warned, calling on all opposition parties to resist what she described as a ""dangerous game"" threatening India’s democracy.Addressing a press conference from Digha in East Medinipur, where she’s overseeing preparations for Friday’s Rath Yatra, the TMC supremo said she had received two lengthy letters from the ECI containing new rules targeting voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004.""I have received two letters from the ECI, each comprising 25-30 pages. I haven't been able to go through them in detail so far. But from what I have understood from a cursory glance, the Commission is now seeking a declaration form from voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, which is Annexure D in one of the letters, where they will have to submit birth certificates of both parents as proof of citizenship,"" she said, according to news agency PTI.""I don't understand the reason behind the ECI move or the rationale behind selecting these dates. This is nothing short of a scam. I seek clarification from the Commission on whether they are trying to implement the NRC through backdoors. In fact, this looks to be more dangerous than the NRC, which every political party in opposition must resist,"" Banerjee added.She futher claimed the BJP’s real target was Bengal, not Bihar, where assembly elections are due later this year.“Nothing will happen in Bihar because the BJP rules that state… They want to delete the names of valid young voters. Many parents will not be able to furnish their birth certificates,” she said, alleging that migrant workers, students, villagers, and uneducated voters were being selectively targeted.Banerjee also accused the ECI of bypassing political parties and serving the agenda of a “certain RSS pracharak” running the country -- an indirect reference to Union home minister Amit Shah.""How can the ECI do this unilaterally without consulting the recognised political parties at the central and state levels who play a key role in running the country's democratic structure? They are treating us like bonded laborers and doing this only to fulfil the wishes of a certain RSS pracharak who is now running the country for all practical purposes,"" she said.Citing an earlier ECI letter asking for details of TMC booth level agents, she asked: ""Why should I reveal the names of my booth agents? So that the BJP can purchase them?""The West Bengal CM alleged that the BJP, with ECI’s support, was trying to enlist outsiders in Bengal's voter rolls while deleting genuine voters.“We ask the poll panel not to pressurise common people to accept their verdict. My humble request to the EC is that it should act impartially like it is expected to,” she said.Calling on opposition parties across India to take note, Banerjee said, “This ploy is now clear as daylight. We are the first to respond. But I urge the other opposition parties to take serious note of this and build resistance.”""Citizens should keep a keen eye on their status in electoral roles till the very end. Else they might find their names struck off and sent to detention camps. That's the intention of the BJP,"" she said, adding, ""our party will build up people's resistance against this and we will soon hit the streets.”","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accuses Election Commission of India of acting as a ""stooge of the BJP"" The TMC supremo said she had received two lengthy letters from the ECI containing new rules targeting voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004.

What is the Communist Control Act? Could Mamdani be deported?







Republicans raised a call to revoke Zohran Mamdani's citizenship and deport him before he becomes New York mayor citing the fact that Mamdani became a US citizen only seven years ago. The 33-year-old Democrat Socialist is the Democratic nominee for New York's mayoral election in November -- after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the primary election.The New York Young Republican Club called for deporting Mamdani as it said: “The radical Zohran Mamdani cannot be allowed to destroy our beloved city of New York.""The club called on White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, known for his hawkish stand on immigration, to invoke the Red Scare-era Communist Control Act to strip Mamdani's citizenship.Stephen Miller already expressed his disgust at Mamdani's win and said it was the ""clearest warning of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration"". “The entire Democrat party is lining up behind the diehard socialist who wants to end all immigration enforcement and abolish the prison system entirely,” he added.The Communist Control Act was signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1954 during the Cold War.The legislation outlawed, in theory, the Communist Party in the United States and prohibited communists from attaining certain positions. But it was rarely enforced.Zohran Mamdani was born in Uganda in 1991 and moved to New York along with his parents at the age of seven in 1988. His father Mahmood Mamdani is an Ugandan-American with his ancestry in India, his mother Mira Nair is an Indian-American. Zohran Mamdani became a naturalized US citizen in 2018.President Donald Trump called Mamdani 100 per cent communist lunatic. Trump also commented on his looks and voice and called everything terrible. “It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.

Between March 1 and April 20, just before the election in Canada, there were more than 2,300 social media posts on X from Canadian accounts targeting South Asians, and the easy target was former NDP leader Jagmeet Singh . A report titled 'The Rise of Anti-South Asian hate in Canada', conducted by UK-based Institute for Strategic Dialog, revealed the trend of a steep rise in hate toward South Asians in Canada, Toronto Star reported.The report said Canada is being used as an example of what happened when immigration policies led to an ""invasion"" of South Asian migrants.The report noted that while the study was on social media hatred, the trend is not limited to the online world. ""Between 2019 and 2023, police-reported hate crimes against South Asians in Canada increased by more than 200 per cent, according to Statistics Canada,"" the report said.Analyst at ISD Steven Rai told the Toronto Star that these stereotypes are being promoted by domestic extremists and then getting picked up by people all around the world. Rai said Jagmeet Singh is a target of hate not only because he's a brown man who wears a turban, but also because he's articulate, well-dressed and has reached the upper echelons of Canadian society.“If you’re a white supremacist and you’re seeing someone like Jagmeet Singh flourish and gain prominence in Canadian politics and in society … a person like that is really seen as a profound threat,” Rai said.Jagmeet Singh stepped down as the party chief after he lost his seat in British Columbia in the election. He lost his sear in the House of Commons that he held since 2019. Singh entered politics in 2011 after being elected to the Ontario provincial parliament. In 2017, he became the leader of his party, the first person of color to head a federal party in Canada.","More than 2,300 social media posts on X from Canadian accounts targeting South Asians.

The Donald Trump administration has asserted it does not plan to re-deport Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia, saying that he was brought back to the United States from his native country El Salvador for trial in the serious federal charges against him.""This is fake news. Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States to face trial for the egregious charges against him.

The latter has been in a Tennessee jail since he was returned to America on June 7 to face human smuggling charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, an incident during which nine passengers without luggage were found in the vehicle which he was driving.He has pleaded ""not guilty"" to the charges which his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify his mistaken deportation.On June 22, magistrate judge Barbara Holmes of Tennessee ruled that the Salvadoran man has a right to be released while awaiting trial. However, Holmes later decided to keep him in custody for at least a few more days over concerns immigration officials would swiftly try to deport him again.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was returned to the United States on June 7 to face human smuggling charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding.

BENGALURU: Two cab drivers duped a youth here on the pretext of providing him a cheaper ride home from the airport.The incident, which was reported to the police on June 23, happened when the victim arrived at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) from Japan on June 20 and was looking to book a taxi to his J P Nagar home.Following the complaint, KIA police have arrested the two accused identified as Santosh, 46, and Kabiruddin, 33. They were remanded in judicial custody.According to the complaint filed by Pradeep Penakalapati, a builder from Puttaparthi in Andhra Pradesh, his son Sandeep, an undergraduate student, had returned from his trip to Japan and walked out of airport Terminal 2 around 1 am. While he was trying to book a taxi, Santosh approached him, offering a ride for Rs 1,000 – cheaper than what cab aggregators would usually charge.Once Sandeep agreed to the fare, the trip started with Kabiruddin, a native of Assam, behind the wheel.However, just a few metres into the ride, Kabiruddin passed his phone to Sandeep, saying there was a ride confirmation call that he needed to respond to. Soon, Sandeep realised it was Santosh at the other end of the call, claiming that the base price for the trip would be Rs 899, with Rs 50 charged for every km. Additionally, 1.9% of the total fare would be levied as night surcharge.Overall, a much higher amount than what was initially agreed upon.Sandeep disagreed with the amount and told Kabiruddin to stop the vehicle so that he could get down, but Kabiruddin continued to drive. He locked the doors and was speeding. He drove till Esteem Mall, turning a deaf ear to Sandeep's insistence to stop the car.Kabiruddin then stopped the car and demanded Rs 4,220. Realising he had been trapped, Sandeep made the payment without a fuss. Kabiruddin then dumped the baggage on the road and sped off.Upon reaching home, Sandeep narrated his ordeal to his father, who lodged a complaint with KIA police.A senior police officer confirmed that there have been complaints about drivers picking up passengers, offering cheaper rides from the airport, but eventually coercing them into paying much higher amounts.He even said that this particular name, Santosh, had figured in some of the other incidents as well, though no one had filed any official plaint against him.","Two cab drivers duped a youth here on the pretext of providing him a cheaper ride home from the airport.

JAMMU: Security forces shot dead a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist Thursday during a gunfight in the rain-soaked forests of Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district, where three of his associates remain trapped.Jammu range IG Bhim Sen Tuti said the terrorists are likely part of a group that police have been tracking in the Jammu region for nearly a year. “The weather is bad in Basantgarh. Once it clears, the situation will become more evident,” he said.Acting on intelligence inputs about the movement of a group of 3–4 terrorists, a joint team of Army and police launched a seek-and-shoot operation in the remote Bihali area early morning.“As the forces approached the location, the terrorists started shooting. Retaliatory shots were fired, resulting in the death of one terrorist. The operation is ongoing,” a senior official said. Additional troops have been rushed in to cut off possible escape routes.Monsoon rain, while slowing troop movement, is helping forces restrict the terrorists’ range and pin them within the forest.Tight security preparations are also underway for Amarnath Yatra scheduled from July 3 to Aug 9. “J&K police are fully ready to secure every pilgrim,” Tuti said. Around 30 additional companies have been deployed this year. He urged pilgrims to avoid independent travel and stick to official convoys for a safe journey.","Jammu range IG Bhim Sen Tuti said the terrorists are likely part of a group that police have been tracking in the Jammu region for nearly a year.

Performer held sign for Gaza, Sudan during Kendrick Lamar’s Halftime set



NFL commends legal action as protester’s past with Brown surfaces



A bold Super Bowl LIX Halftime protester has resurfaced — this time in handcuffs. Months after shocking millions by interrupting Kendrick Lamar’s halftime set with a political message, the man behind the disruption has been arrested. Even more explosive? He’s now linked to a violent incident involving former NFL star Antonio Brown — one that includes gunfire and an attempted murder charge.New Orleans-based artist Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, 41, turned himself in this week after Louisiana State Police issued a warrant related to his actions during the February 9 Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show. He was booked at the Orleans Parish Justice Center on counts of resisting an officer and disturbing the peace by interrupting a lawful assembly, according to The Associated Press.During the show, Nantambu — who was cleared to be on the field — climbed atop a performance car used in Kendrick Lamar’s act and held up a sign with “Gaza” and “Sudan” written on it. Though initially detained and released without charges, he received a lifetime ban from all NFL events. Officials later stated he “deviated from his assigned role,” and the league has since supported the legal action taken.NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy responded to the arrest, stating: “We take any attempt to disrupt any part of an NFL game, including the halftime show, very seriously and are pleased this individual will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”In a startling development, Nantambu is also the victim in a separate alleged shooting involving Antonio Brown. The incident occurred on May 17 outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, Florida, where Brown allegedly got into a fight with Nantambu, stole a security guard’s firearm, and fired two shots, one of which reportedly grazed Nantambu’s neck.Also read: “Thank god I’m not murdered”: Man details shooting in altercation with former NFL star Antonio Brown Police claim surveillance video supports the victim’s version, and a warrant for attempted murder has since been issued against Brown.

Gillibrand is the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee which works to elect Democratic candidates in the Senate and defend incumbents.But Democratic Rep.

Washington: US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday said he was unaware of any intelligence suggesting Iran had moved any of its highly enriched uranium to shield it from US strikes.US military bombers carried out strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities early Sunday local time. The results of the strikes are being closely watched to see how far they may have set back Iran's nuclear programme. ""I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be, moved or otherwise,"" Hegseth said.Several experts had noted satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showing ""unusual activity"" at Fordo on Thursday and Friday, with a long line of vehicles waiting outside an entrance to the facility. A senior Iranian source told Reuters on Sunday that most of the 60% highly enriched uranium had been moved to an undisclosed location before the US attack. Experts quoted by the Associated Press said enriched uranium stocks can be moved in small canisters and are hard to find.Hegseth's comments denying such claims came at the news briefing where he also accused the media of downplaying the success of the US strikes following a leaked, preliminary assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency suggesting they may have only set back Iran by months.At the Pentagon news conference, Hegseth described the strikes as ""historically successful.""Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed victory in the war with Israel and said the US's intervention achieved nothing, in his first comments since a ceasefire came into effect earlier this week. ""The Islamic Republic emerged victorious and delivered a harsh slap to America's face"" he said in a pre-recorded video message. ""This action can be repeated in the future,"" he said, adding the US ""gained no achievements from this war. "" Khamenei said the attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities ""were unable to do anything important."" In a reference to Trump's claims that the strikes ""obliterated"" the nuclear sites, he insisted that the President had ""exaggerated"" their effectiveness.Centrifuges at the Fordo uranium enrichment plant in Iran are ""no longer operational"" after the United States attacked the facility with bunker-busting bombs, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog IAEA Rafael Grossi said on French radio. Centrifuges, which are spinning machines used to enrich uranium, require a high-degree of precision and are vulnerable to intense vibrations, Grossi said. But he said it would be ""too much"" to assert that Iran's nuclear program is ""wiped out"". ap, reuters, nyt",US military bombers carried out strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities early Sunday local time.

Operation Midnight Hammer: Tehran confirms nuclear sites suffered 'serious' damage; mulls ending IAEA access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/operation-midnight-hammer-tehran-confirms-nuclear-sites-suffered-serious-damage-mulls-ending-iaea-access/articleshow/122102655.cms,"File photo: Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi (Picture credit: AP)





Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country’s nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend’s US airstrikes on three facilities, the first such official acknowledgement from Tehran.“The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” Araghchi said on Iran’s state television, confirming the full impact of Operation Midnight Hammer, reported the New York Times.The strikes, launched by US B-2 bombers using bunker-busting bombs, targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Araghchi’s remarks contrasted sharply with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who earlier in the day had dismissed US President Donald Trump’s claims of “obliteration” as “exaggerated.”While Khamenei insisted in a prerecorded video that the attacks “were unable to do anything important,” Araghchi painted a far more serious picture and also warned that Iran may end its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Without a doubt, we are obliged to enforce this law,” he said, referring to a bill passed by hard-liners and approved by the Guardian Council that would suspend all collaboration with the UN nuclear watchdog.He added, “Our relationship with the agency will take a different shape,” and noted that a visit by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi “would not be welcomed” at this time. Iran has also hinted that it may no longer permit IAEA inspections and will stop filing monitoring reports, a move that has drawn global concern.Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei had earlier admitted the nuclear sites were “badly damaged.” Israeli military officials and American intelligence have similarly assessed that the strikes significantly degraded Iran’s nuclear program, with Brig Gen Effie Defrin stating it has been “set back by years.”US President Trump has defended the strikes, comparing them to the end-of-World War II atomic bombings in Japan. “I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima or Nagasaki… but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” he said.However, key questions remain unresolved. Iran has not revealed the fate of its 400 kilograms of enriched uranium, enough for nearly 10 nuclear bombs, nor has it confirmed the status of its advanced centrifuges. These details could be clarified by IAEA inspectors, should Tehran allow access.Analysts, including Sina Azodi of George Washington University, believe Tehran is using the confusion to its advantage. “Iran wants to keep everything in the dark… to play the diplomatic game of poker,” Azodi was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Despite Araghchi saying “no agreement has yet been reached” to resume talks, the White House has maintained a tone of cautious optimism. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the administration’s commitment to diplomacy, saying, “The president wants peace. He always has… and we’re on a diplomatic path with Iran”.Talks are tentatively expected next week, with special envoy Steve Witkoff continuing behind-the-scenes negotiations, supported by regional partners like Qatar.However, Araghchi warned, saying, “Going through a war changes many realities… diplomacy must adjust itself to this new reality.”","Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country's nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend's US airstrikes on three facilities. “The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” he said.

Federal prosecutors informed a judge on Thursday that if Kilmar Abrego Garcia is released from a Tennessee jail, the Trump administration will initiate removal proceedings to deport him to a country other than his native El Salvador, according to Fox News.When US Magistrate Judge Paula Xinis questioned the timing of the removal, asking whether it would be “30 seconds, 30 days, or 30 months,” a federal prosecutor responded that he could only confirm the removal was not “imminent.”Judge Xinis has scheduled the next hearing on the matter for July 7.""This defendant has been charged with horrific crimes, including trafficking children, and will not walk free in our country again,"" a Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News.""This defendant has been charged with horrific crimes, including trafficking children, and will not walk free in our country again,"" a justice department spokesperson told Fox News.The central issue is whether Judge Paula Xinis has the authority to order Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s return to Maryland.

Iran-Israel New War Erupts At UN; Tehran ‘EXPOSES’ U.S. For BOMBING Nukes | ‘Master Of Lies’





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes. He said the site suffered “total obliteration” and warned that further action would follow if Tehran were to resume uranium enrichment.While speaking to reporters at the Nato summit in The Hague, Trump said, “You know they have guys that go in there after the hit, and they said it was total obliteration.”He said that Israel is currently assessing the damage inflicted on the sites.“Israel is doing a report on it now, I understand, and I was told that they said it was total obliteration. I believe it was total obliteration, and I believe they didn’t have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,” he added.Israeli officials, while responding to remarks made by Trump, told Kan public broadcaster, that they were not aware of any Israeli operation at Fordo nuclear site after the US strikes.Earlier in the week a leaked Pentagon intelligence report first reported by CNN, suggested that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities might have left core components largely intact, and that Iran’s nuclear program has essentially only been set back only by months.Adding that a significant portion of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile may have been moved out of the facilities before the bombings took place.The White House has dismissed the report's conclusions and criticized the leak.When asked by the reporters if the US would strike Iran again if Tehran were to rebuild its uranium enrichment facilities, Trump said, “Sure. But I’m not going to have to worry about that. It’s gone for years.”In response to a question about the extent of the setback to Iran’s nuclear program, Trump said, “I think it’s basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again. I think they’ve had it. I mean, they just went through hell. They’ve had it.”“The last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now,” Trump said. “They want to recover,” he added.“They’re not going to have a bomb and they’re not going to enrich,” he stressed.Trump went on to compare the American strikes on the three Iranian nuclear sites with the nuclear bombing of Japan towards the end of world war two, “That hit ended the war. That hit ended the war. I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing that ended that war. This ended that, this ended that war. If we didn’t take that out, they would have been fighting right now. ”“I think we’ll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran,” he added.","US President Donald Trump claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes.

'Iran can never get nukes': US secretary of state Marco Rubio talks tough with PM Shehbaz Sharif; Pakistan criticised strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iran-can-never-get-nukes-us-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-talks-tough-with-pm-shehbaz-sharif-pakistan-criticised-strikes-on-tehrans-nuclear-sites/articleshow/122103555.cms,"



US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

US confident, Iran disputes impact





The US military has revealed new details about the strike on Iran’s nuclear site at Fordo, with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine recounting the dramatic return of the B-2 crews and the years of secret planning behind the mission dubbed ‘Operation Midnight Hammer’.“This was the brightest explosion I’ve ever seen—it looked like daylight,” one pilot told Caine after watching the massive 30,000-pound bunker-buster detonate. The crew had taken off not knowing if they would return. When they landed, “flags were flying and tears were flowing,” Caine said, describing the emotional moment at Whiteman Air Force Base.Also read: Satellite images show damage caused to Iran’s Fordo, Isfahan, Natanz nuclear sites after US strike; see pics ""A crew member told me when I talked to them on video the other day that this felt like the Super Bowl, the thousands of scientists, airmen, and maintainers all coming together,"" Caine said.Operation Midnight Hammer targeted Iran’s key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. The US deployed 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs — steel-encased, fused to detonate at precise depths.Fordow, built deep underground, had two ventilation routes. Each route had three shafts, a main one flanked by two smaller ones, resembling a pitchfork in Pentagon imagery. Days before the strike, Iran placed concrete slabs over these shafts.According to Caine, the bombs were refined over years of testing on mock facilities. The aim was to delay detonation until the bomb could release a pressure wave through tunnels, destroying underground enrichment equipment.Caine outlined the story of two unnamed officers from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), who had studied the Fordo site for over 15 years.“In 2009, a DTRA officer was brought into a vault at an undisclosed location and shown images of major construction in the Iranian mountains,” he said. The officer, and later a teammate, spent years tracking the site’s geology, airflow systems, construction materials, and movement of equipment in and out of the complex.“They literally dreamed about this target,” Caine said. “They thought about it driving to work. From the first days, they knew what it was for. You don’t build a multilayered underground bunker with centrifuges in a mountain for any peaceful purpose.”Their long effort highlighted one central challenge: the US did not yet have a weapon capable of destroying such a site. So they began working with industry to develop what became the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, Caine said.Hundreds of tests were conducted to ensure the weapon would work.“They tested it over and over again. Dropped full-scale weapons on realistic targets. All for one purpose—kill this target at the time and place of our choosing,” said Caine.Then, in June, the call came from President Trump: execute the mission.Operation Midnight Hammer was launched. Crews from the active-duty Air Force and Missouri Air National Guard carried out the mission, departing on Friday and returning Sunday.Caine described what followed: “Late Saturday night, their families became aware of what was happening. On Sunday, when the jets returned from Whiteman, their families were there, flags flying, and tears flowing. A commander told me, ‘This is a moment in the lives of our families they will never forget.’”Jets flew in formation over the base before landing. “That, my friends, is what America’s Joint Force does,” said Caine.There was no visible crater at Fordo by design. The GBU-57 is built to penetrate deep before detonating.“All six weapons hit exactly where they were intended,” Caine confirmed, targeting each vent shaft of the underground complex. “The primary kill mechanism was a mix of overpressure and blast, ripping through the tunnels and destroying critical hardware.”He said the damage was consistent with extensive modelling, with shockwaves amplifying destruction in the facility’s confined spaces.President Trump has described the outcome as “total obliteration,” with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth dismissing media reports that the damage may have been overstated.However, Iran has disputed the scale of the strike’s impact. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said the US had “exaggerated” its success, insisting it did “nothing significant” to the programme. Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi called the damage “serious” but refused to confirm the programme was crippled.Despite Iranian denials, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, confirmed “extensive damage” at Fordo and other sites, including Natanz and Isfahan.","Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

‘We should have had a choice’: Brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia taken off life support after premature birth; baby weighs 1 Kg,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-should-have-had-a-choice-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-in-georgia-taken-off-life-support-after-premature-birth-baby-weighs-1-kg/articleshow/122098897.cms,"Representative image (AI)

WHAT IS THE LAW?





A brain-dead pregnant Black woman in Georgia was kept on life support due to the state's abortion restrictions but was removed from it after giving birth to a baby boy, according to a report by AFP.Officials stated that the woman, identified as Adriana Smith, gave birth prematurely to a baby boy weighing less than 1 kilogram. Named Chance, the baby was delivered via emergency C-section on June 13 and is currently being cared for in the NICU.Smith, who was taken off life support on June 17, drew national attention as her case unfolded amid major changes to abortion access following the supreme court’s 2022 decision to overturn the federal right to abortion in a review of landmark Roe v Wade judgement granting women to terminate a pregnancy.“On Friday, June 13, 2025, her infant son, named Chance, was born prematurely at approximately 4:41 am via emergency Cesarean section,"" three Democratic congresswomen said in a statement. “Chance weighs about 1 pound, 13 ounces and is currently in the NICU.""Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, began experiencing severe headaches in February while nine weeks pregnant. Her first hospital visit resulted in just a prescription for medication, according to the agency.The following morning, she was brought to the hospital where she was employed. There, doctors discovered multiple blood clots in her brain and ultimately declared her brain dead.Georgia law prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, under what is known as a ‘heartbeat’ law, based on the first detection of a fetal heartbeat.Since Smith was nine weeks pregnant, doctors were reluctant to take any action that might violate the law, according to her mother, April Newkirk. Speaking to local NBC affiliate WXIA-TV in mid-May, she said, “This decision should’ve been left to us. I’m not saying that we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, what I’m saying is: we should have had a choice.”Since the conservative-leaning supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022, more than 20 of the 50 US states, including Georgia, have enacted strict abortion restrictions or complete bans.The three congresswomen Nikema Williams, Ayanna Pressley, and Sara Jacobs are advocating for stronger protections for pregnant women’s rights, especially for Black women, who are disproportionately affected by systemic medical neglect and strict anti-abortion laws.“The lack of a formal legal opinion or prosecutorial guidance leaves families and doctors in limbo,"" said the lawmakers, who have presented a congressional resolution on the issue.","Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, began experiencing severe headaches in February while nine weeks pregnant.

‘About the worst’: US defense Secy Pete Hegseth rips former Fox News colleague over Iran question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/about-the-worst-us-defense-secy-pete-hegseth-rips-former-fox-news-colleague-over-iran-question-watch/articleshow/122096703.cms,"Pete Hegseth (AP) and Jennifer Griffin (She said podcast)





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth ripped Fox News reporter and his former colleague Jennifer Griffin on Thursday, saying she has “been about the worst” in the media when it comes to reporting on the American bombings of multiple Iranian nuclear sites.Addressing the press briefing organised by the Pentagon on Operation Midnight Hunter, Hegseth said Griffin was arguably the most high-profile journalist to “misrepresent what the President says” regarding the operation.The remarks came after Griffin, Fox News’ chief national security correspondent, who has been with the channel for over 25-years, questioned Hegseth about how effective the strikes had been and whether he was certain that highly enriched uranium was present at the Fordow nuclear facility during the US strike, noting that satellite images had captured trucks at the site two days earlier.“Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside the Fordow Mountain?” Griffin asked. “Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved?”Hegseth, a former Fox & Friends co-host, seemed visibly irritated by the question, prompting his sharp response.""Of course, we're watching every single aspect. But, Jennifer, you've been about the worst. The one who misrepresents the most, intentionally, what the president says.""In response to Hegseth’s remarks, Griffin stood by her reporting on Fordow, stating she was the first to accurately detail the B-2 bombers, their midair refueling, and the overall mission, adding, “so I take issue with that.”He is not the first member of the Trump administration to attack and discredit the media on the questions over the effectiveness of Iran strikes.After a leaked initial assessment by the Pentagon’s defence intelligence agency, suggested that US strikes last week on Iran’s nuclear sites may have left core components of facilities largely intact, and that Iran’s nuclear program has essentially only been set back by months rather than “obliterated.” President Trump himself expressed frustration with media outlets like CNN and The New York Times for questioning the success of the operation, labeling them “scum” for their coverage.Other members of his administration, including Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, and John Ratclif have dismissed the report as false, with Gabbard stating that U.S. intelligence confirms the sites were “destroyed.”","Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, attacked Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin for questioning the effectiveness of US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated. Speaking during the budget session of National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers. ” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said. He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict.“We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon... Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he said.Bilawal urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will increase in both countries,” he warned, adding Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.
