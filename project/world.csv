NEW DELHIl Parliament proceedings were disrupted on Thursday as opposition parties protested the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls, while in RS, leader of the House JP Nadda accused them of displaying ""double standards"" by walking out when home minister Amit Shah started replying to the debate on Operation Sindoor on Wednesday, insisting that a reply come from PM Modi.Nadda cited a precedent from the Congress-led UPA government era, when a discussion on the home ministry's statement on the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks was replied to by the then PM and home minister in LS, and then by the home minister in RS.LoP in RS Mallikarjun Kharge, however, later clarified that the opposition had not walked out against Shah's replying to the debate but to protest his remark ""main akela hi apko nipat lunga (I can handle you myself)"".

"Malegaon blast case: Bomb could have been placed later on motorbike, says judge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-bomb-could-have-been-placed-later-on-motorbike-says-judge/articleshow/123030437.cms,"MUMBAI: Thursday's judgment in the 2008 Malegaon blast case , in which all seven accused were acquitted, also focused on the failure to establish that a bomb was fitted inside a motorcycle. Based on the evidence, the judge said a bomb could have been placed later on the bike. Refuting the prosecution's case, the judge also noted that it could not be proved that the bike on which the bomb was allegedly fitted belonged to Thakur, that RDX was procured by Lt Col Prasad Purohit from Kashmir, or that he assembled the bomb.The judge also found sanction orders granted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to be defective and invalid, issued without ""application of judicial mind"".The NIA judge said the conspiracy in Malegaon blast case remained unproven due to absence of evidence and witnesses who would testify that a series of meetings were held by the organisation named Abhinav Bharat to plan the attack.ATS probes focused on the alleged conspiracy by a group intent on avenging perceived atrocities against Hindus. The crux of prosecution's case was that the plot revealed an effort to strike terror by orchestrating a bomb blast in Malegaon, a Muslim-dominated area.However, the judge said to show that the main elements of the conspiracy were finalised at Faridabad and Bhopal, the prosecution was not supported by ""material witnesses"" and the testimony of those who did was not ""reliable and acceptable...other meetings which were held at Kolkata, Indore, Ujjain, Nashik and Pune, no acceptable evidence is present on these on record... witnesses have retracted from their earlier statements given to ATS. Therefore, neither conspiracy is proved nor meetings are proved,"" the judge said. While it was alleged that that accused Ajay Rahirkar, acting as treasurer of Abhinav Bharat, collected donations and distributed funds to Lt Col Prasad Purohit, who was a trustee, as well as to Sudhakar Dhar Diwedi and Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd), Purohit used these funds for personal expenses, including house construction and paying for LIC policies. ""But there was no evidence that the said amount was used for terrorist activities,"" the judge said.The retraction by 39 of 323 prosecution witnesses of statements given to ATS considerably weakened the case. ""Testimony of prosecution witnesses is riddled with material inconsistencies and contradictions,"" the judge said.Referring to procedural shortcomings, the judge was critical of the handling of the crime scene. It was revealed that no rough sketch map was drawn, and the spot was not immediately barricaded, leading to contamination. The judge pointed out that a mob gathered at the spot after the blast, pelted stones, vandalised cars, caused damage to a police chowki, and snatched the firearms of police officers. He said a counterattack by police involved lathicharge, firing, and use of grenades.Despite the presence of a fingerprint expert, no prints, DNA samples, or other critical data were collected at the spot. The judge said since the spot was contaminated, analysis of articles found could not be considered 100% accurate anyway. Even material seized such as mobiles and laptops were not sealed as per due process.The judgment also raised concerns about procedures adopted for collecting voice samples and intercepting mobile communication. The judge observed that interceptions were not authorised in the specific period, and permissions were obtained belatedly. This rendered the intercepted data unusable as evidence. It was also noted that ""narco analysis was carried out of the accused by ATS but not supported by documents and it was not filed on record"".The judgment even raised concerns about planting of evidence and tampering of material. It has called for an inquiry into the actions of ATS officer Shekhar Bagade, whose presence at an accused's house was seen to be under suspicious circumstances. ""House search of accused Sudhakar Chaturvedi tilt towards planting (of RDX) in the light of evidence of record. There was no conscious possession over the house, and articles, found at the relevant time,"" the judge said. Chaturvedi was accused of assembling the bomb at his home, a claim he denied.The judge pointed out that despite allegations that Purohit had brought RDX from Kashmir, no evidence was presented to show its storage at his house or its use in assembling the bomb. Interestingly, NIA's supplementary chargesheet in May 2016 had accused ATS of planting RDX traces to frame Purohit and, notably, gave a clean chit to Pragya Thakur and others, citing insufficient evidence. Despite NIA's stance, the special court, on Dec 27, 2017, ruled that seven accused, including Thakur and Purohit, would face trial under UAPA, though charges under MCOCA were dropped.In his concluding remarks Thursday, the judge expressed awareness of ""agony, frustration and trauma caused to society at large, more particularly to the family of victims, by the fact that a crime of this nature has gone unpunished"".""However law does not permit the court to convict the accused solely on the basis of moral conviction or suspicion,"" the judge said.As per the judgment, a compensation of Rs 2 lakh is to be paid to families of those who died in the blast, while the 95 injured will receive Rs 50,000 each. The case, meanwhile, will continue against two absconding accused, Ramji Kalsangra & Sandeep Dange. Five different judges have so far presided over proceedings. The tenure of the current judge, A K Lahoti, was recently extended by Bombay high court till Aug 31, 2025 to ensure he could deliver the verdict.",The NIA judge said the conspiracy in Malegaon blast case remained unproven due to absence of evidence. The judge also found sanction orders granted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to be defective and invalid.

"Malegaon blast case: UAPA sanctions invalid, terror charge can't stick, rules court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-uapa-sanctions-invalid-terror-charge-cant-stick-rules-court/articleshow/123029929.cms,"MUMBAI: Special trial judge A K Lahoti, in a key finding that led to the collapse of the Malegaon blast case , held that the prior sanction under the anti-terror law UAPA against the accused was ""invalid."" It was issued without judicious application of mind, and the mandatory twin test safeguard required by law was not scrupulously followed, the court said.The judge analysed Section 45 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which outlines procedural safeguards. Section 45(1) requires valid sanction from the Centre or state govt to prosecute any terror offence under the Act. Section 45(2) mandates an independent review of the evidence by an authority appointed by the govt.Lt Col Prasad Purohit, through his counsel Shrikant Shivade (who passed away in 2022) and later advocate Viral Babar, had consistently argued that the UAPA sanction was flawed. Other accused also challenged the validity of the Jan 2009 sanction and another issued in 2011 by the additional chief secretary (home). The trial court held both sanctions to be ""defective.""While the prosecution claimed it had followed the twin test, the court said there was no evidence it was done as mandated under Section 45(2).""The sanction is not a curable defect. So, all the provisions of UAPA will not be invoked,"" the judge ruled.Advocates Ranjeet Sangle (for Sudhakar Dwivedi) and J P Mishra (for Sadhvi Pragya Singh) also argued that the first sanction bypassed the statutory safeguard under Section 45(2), and that the absence of such review invalidated the trial court's cognisance of UAPA charges.Special public prosecutor Avinash Rasal had contended that the sanction's validity could only be decided during the trial, a view echoed by the Supreme Court in 2018.However, the special judge reviewed the sanctioning procedure and found that UAPA charges could not be sustained due to the faulty sanction. Shivade had also pointed out that the authority did not comply with the mandatory safeguard of an additional review committee required under law since Dec 31, 2008.The prosecution argued that since the crime occurred in Sept 2008, the earlier 2004 provision-without the second review-was applicable. But the Supreme Court clarified in 2023 that the UAPA's procedural safeguards during sanction are mandatory.","Special trial judge A K Lahoti held that the prior sanction under the anti- terror law UAPA against the accused was ""invalid"" It was issued without judicious application of mind, and the mandatory twin test safeguard required by law was not scrupulously followed, the court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123029934,imgsize-744366,width-400,resizemode-4/123029934.jpg"

BAREILLY: An IAS officer, who once survived seven bullets after exposing a Rs 100-crore scam, was transferred within 36 hours of taking charge as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Shahjahanpur's Powayan. The move came on Monday, hours after Rinku Singh Rahi hit the headlines once again - this time for performing sit-ups before a group of lawyers and cancelling two unpublicised land auctions.A video of the ""uthak-baithak"" was shared on social media. Rahi believes it may have cost him the post. Shahjahanpur DM Dharmendra Pratap Singh, however, told TOI, ""Rahi's transfer was initiated by the state govt and I have no idea about the precise reason behind it.""The auctions involved rights to village fish ponds and cattle shed land in Simra Viran. They were scheduled without public announcements, he said, a technical omission that could prevent fair bidding. ""More people deserve the chance to participate in such auctions. My decision may have upset some people,"" Rahi, a 2022 batch IAS officer, said.On the same day, he directed revenue officers to identify encroachments on govt land and issue notices.""If no notice is issued within 15 days, an FIR will be filed against the lekhpal concerned,"" he warned. He also planned to digitise tehsil-level records, including court proceedings and document submissions. ""People shouldn't have to file RTIs to get basic information,"" he said.After landing in the town for his latest posting, he proposed creating two WhatsApp groups in every village - one to allow residents to report absentee officials, and another to post complaints and their responses openly. ""I had already done this in Mathura as a provincial civil services officer. This is not innovation. This is basic administration.""But it was the sit-ups on Monday that drew public attention. After asking a clerk to do sit-ups for urinating in the open, Rahi himself performed sit-ups in front of lawyers at the tehsil premises after they pointed out filthy public toilets. ""I took responsibility because I was the senior-most officer. If seniors lead by example, systems improve,"" he said. Asked whether the video led to his transfer, he said, ""Could be. ""He added: ""I will serve wherever I'm posted. I'll not tolerate wrongdoing.""In 2008, as a provincial civil service officer in Muzaffarnagar, he exposed irregular transfers of social welfare funds. ""When I refused bribes and kept digging, I was warned,"" he said. On March 26, 2009, while playing badminton, he was shot in the face. The attack left him blind in one eye, with a bullet fragment lodged in his skull. ""I lost everything except the will to fight,"" he said.Four years later, in 2012, after being denied promotion, he staged a dharna outside the social welfare directorate in Lucknow. Police forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric facility. A decade later, he cleared the UPSC exam under the physically challenged category at age 40, secured all-India rank 683, and joined the 2022-batch IAS under the Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) quota, UP cadre.His tenure in Shahjahanpur lasted less than two days. His plans, he said, were simple: open the system to scrutiny, restore accountability, and make governance participatory.","Rinku Singh Rahi once survived seven bullets after exposing a Rs 100-crore scam.

He had also suggested that India would get a good deal for its compliance.Trump's outburst on Truth Social on Wednesday conflicted with his claim of having frog marched India to cease Operation Sindoor by dangling the threat of stopping trade.Interestingly, the 'all things not good' admission from the US president, who has earned the reputation of being the global scold because of his petulance and pugnacity, came on a day when the two Houses of Parliament concluded a debate on Operation Sindoor that was dominated by Trump's claim of having mediated the suspension of hostilities.Also read: India-US trade deal: Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India - top developments On Tuesday, PM Modi had refuted Trump's claim, saying no global leader had asked him to cease the offensive, and that it was the sheer ferocity of the IAF strikes on Pakistan's airbases that led Islamabad to sue for peace on May 10. That was getting as close as an Indian PM could get to accuse the US president of inexactitude.External affairs minister S Jaishankar went a step further on both Tuesday and Wednesday, stating that Trump and Modi did not talk between April 22 and June 16 when in a telephonic conversation, Modi had rebutted the suggestion that the operation against Pakistan was ceased because of anyone's mediation.In a significant decision, the Modi govt got foreign secretary Vikram Misri to let out details of the conversation.

Weather forecast: More rain, winds, and flood risk







A powerful storm system unleashed heavy rain and flash flooding across the US East Coast on Thursday, prompting New York City and New Jersey to declare states of emergency.Streets turned into rivers, subways flooded, cars were stranded, and public transportation came to a halt as the storm system swept through major cities from New York to Washington, D C.City officials issued urgent warnings as the situation worsened throughout the day, urging residents to avoid travel and take shelter indoors.Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for New York City and surrounding counties. ""Heavy rain and potential flooding are expected to affect the evening commute. Employers are encouraged to dismiss employees early. Continue to monitor your local forecasts, and stay safe,"" she posted on X.New Jersey Acting Governor Tahesha Way also declared a state of emergency, effective from 2 pm Thursday. She said, ""beginning this afternoon, we are expecting severe thunderstorms to bring heavy rainfall and damaging wind gusts with the potential for flash flooding across the state.""""I urge all New Jerseyans to remain alert, follow all safety protocols, and monitor the proper channels for the duration of these storms.Residents should remain off the roads and indoors unless absolutely necessary,"" she added.New York City Mayor Eric Adams issued a travel advisory through Friday and activated the city's flash flood emergency plan. ""Avoid traveling if you can, and set up any flood prevention tools in advance,"" he posted on X.In New York City, the flooding was widespread and dramatic. Viral videos showed water pouring into subway stations, including Grand Central Terminal, and pooling on the floors of buses.At the 7th Avenue station in Brooklyn’s Park Slope, floodwater was seen bursting through the walls.Commuter trains weren’t spared either. In Queens, a Long Island Rail Road train came to a halt after floodwaters engulfed the tracks. Firefighters and emergency crews from the FDNY were seen wading through murky, chest-high water to assist passengers and clear the path.The Clearview Expressway in Queens was closed in both directions as floodwaters submerged vehicles, including a tractor-trailer. Law enforcement pulled people from cars before traffic slowly resumed.The storm wreaked havoc on nearly all forms of transportation. Subway lines were delayed or suspended.Even MTA buses were not spared, one was seen flooded in viral videos, compounding earlier chaos from a morning power outage that crippled several subway lines, where floodwater could be seen seeping through the walls.Commuter trains into Long Island and New Jersey were halted during rush hour. Flights across major airports in New York, New Jersey, Washington, and Philadelphia were delayed or canceled.In Maryland, multiple water rescues took place north of Baltimore, and roads known to flood were closed preemptively. Emergency shelters opened in anticipation of more storms overnight.In Pennsylvania, the National Weather Service issued warnings of up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain falling within an hour, triggering flash floods in the city of Reading, located about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia, according to the Associated Press.Videos showed streets underwater, parked cars half-submerged, and emergency vehicles blocking impassable intersections.Amtrak suspended trains between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, due to high water over the tracks.High wind gusts, hail, and the potential for tornadoes were also part of the storm system. In New Jersey, tornado warnings were issued but no twisters were confirmed. Still, more than 14,000 people were left without electricity Thursday evening.Flood watches continued overnight into Friday morning, with authorities warning that creeks, highways, underpasses, and basements were especially vulnerable.Zachary Iscol, commissioner of NYC Emergency Management, warned that the storm could bring ""intense rainfall rates and amounts in a very short period of time.” City officials urged residents, especially those living in basement apartments, to move to higher ground.This storm comes just two weeks after intense rainstorms also flooded New York City and led to two deaths in New Jersey.With more rain expected overnight and into Friday, authorities across the region remain on high alert.As of Thursday night, much of the New York metro area remained paralysed, with nearly all forms of public transportation across the city.","New York City Mayor Eric Adams issued a travel advisory through Friday and activated the city's flash flood emergency plan.

Boy's parents got Rs 5 lakh ransom call: Police

Biker intercepted boy on his way home





BENGALURU: A teenager, who was abducted while returning home from tuitions on Wednesday evening, was found murdered in south Bengaluru on Thursday.The 13-year-old boy's partially burnt body was found in a rocky terrain on Bannerghatta-Gottigere Road, 8km from his house.Also read: Bengaluru boy kidnap-murder: 2 accused held after encounter near Bannerghatta; slit kid's throat fearing police case Nischith A was an eighth standard student of Christ School and a resident of Vysya Bank Colony near Arakere, off Bannerghatta Road. His father Achutha JC is a college lecturer and the mother works in a tech company.According to police, Nischith's parents had approached Hulimavu police on Wednesday evening saying their son had gone missing after attending tuitions.His father had stated: ""Nischith attends classes from 5pm at the tuition centre on Arakere 80ft Road and returns by 7.30pm everyday. When he did not return home till 8 pm, we first confirmed with the teacher that he attended the classes. We went searching for him on his regular route, and found his bicycle near Family Park in the area. We checked with our relatives and his friends, but no one knew where he went.""Police registered a case around 10.30pm and told the parents they too would intensify the search.Around 1am Thursday, Nischith A's parents received a Rs 5-lakh ransom call from an unknown person.Police said the father reportedly agreed to the demand and pleaded for his son's safe return. The caller told them to arrange the money and disconnected the call stating he would share the location in the morning.A second call came early Thursday to know whether they had arranged money. On learning that the family was ready with the payment, the kidnapper started dropping multiple locations, sending the desperate parents from one place to another. ""Probably, the kidnapper was trying to make sure cops are not secretly tailing the parents,"" an officer said.Suddenly, the kidnapper's phone was found switched off. Immediately, the parents alerted cops. According to police, the boy's body was discovered around 5.30pm Thursday by a passerby along Bannerghatta-Gottigere Road.On being informed, Bannerghatta police shared a message with nearby police stations about the boy's approximate age and photograph. Hulimavu police, who reached the spot along with Nischith's parents, confirmed his identity.Preliminary investigation, based on footage captured by cameras on Nischith's regular route, revealed a biker intercepted the boy on the way back home. After a brief conversation, Nischith left behind the bicycle and rode pillion on the bike. Police are trying to ascertain the biker's identity, besides tracking the mobile number used for making the ransom call.","Nischith A's parents received a Rs 5-lakh ransom call from an unknown person.

BENGALURU: It was Ed Sheeran's brush with the cops on Church Street in Feb this year that hit the headlines in the city and beyond, with the men in uniform quite literally pulling the plug on the English singer-songwriter's impromptu gig for not having obtained prior permission for his 'show'.Over the past five days, in a redux of that Feb incident, two German social media influencers had to be removed from the same stretch of the city by the police after they arrived there to record videos, triggering chaos and holding up traffic.In the first instance, TikToker Noel Robinson was fined Rs 200 for causing public nuisance. He was seen dancing on Church Street with a crowd around him, holding up traffic on Saturday. He was taken to Cubbon Park police station, where he paid the fine.Another German social media influencer, Younes Zarou, arrived at Church Street on Wednesday evening.Younes Zarou, too, had to be whisked away by cops after a large crowd turned up. However, no police case was registered against him.This was Zarou's second visit to Church Street. Last Sept, he had announced distribution of electronic gadgets to the public at the same place. In a social media post Wednesday, Zarou had announced: ""Church Street, we are coming.""This drew thousands of fans to the busy stretch, before police dispersed them, citing concerns over public safety.Akshay M Hakay, deputy commissioner of police (central division), said they found it difficult to extricate Zarou safely out of the crowd.""Around 4pm, we received a call at the police control room, saying a large crowd had gathered on Church Street, blocking traffic and causing a nuisance. Immediately, police officials in a Hoysala vehicle were rushed to the spot. By then, around 2,000 people had gathered there. We brought Zarou safely out of the crowd and allowed him to leave. No case was registered,"" Hakay told TOI.Similarly, last Saturday, the public had called the police control room, saying a man was causing public nuisance by dancing on the road and blocking vehicles.""A patrolling Hoysala vehicle reached the spot and told Noel and the others to stop dancing and clear the road. After Hoysala staffers' repeated requests to vacate the road turned futile, Noel was detained and taken to Cubbon Park police station,"" a senior police officer said.",Two German social media influencers had to be removed from the same stretch of the city by the police after they arrived there to record videos.

Following this, the family filed a case at the Niwai police station, alleging that another student mixed something in a cold drink, tortured and blackmailed their daughter, and made a video.The incident raised several questions about why Banasthali Vidyapith concealed the incident and why it was not reported to the police.On Monday, some police officers visited Banasthali Vidyapith, and it is speculated that Tonk superintendent of police Rajesh Meena is personally investigating the seriousness of the matter.The viral video investigation follows previous questions raised about the institution's operations in several cases of student suicides. District collector Kalpana Agrawal stated that action will be taken in response to the viral video case as per the notice from the State Human Rights Commission.Renowned for Panchsheel education in the country and abroad, the largest women's deemed university in the country, Banasthali Vidyapith, is once again embroiled in controversy.

Roger Goodell reacts emotionally to NYC shooting in first interview since incident



It was a message of unity in the face of violence



FAQs:



Q1. What happened at the NFL's New York City office building?

Q2. Who were the victims of the NYC shooting incident?

What was meant to be a celebratory kickoff to the NFL pre-season turned into a somber reflection of loss and staying together in tough times. As football fans gathered for the Hall of Fame Game between the Detroit Lions and Los Angeles Chargers, the absence of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke a lot about the weight of the moment. He remained in New York to honor the life of NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, one of four victims in a senseless act of violence that shook the league’s headquarters earlier this week.While the annual Hall of Fame festivities in Canton typically mark one of the NFL's most cherished traditions, this year, grief eclipsed celebration. Roger Goodell, deeply affected by the tragedy that unfolded at 345 Park Ave., where the NFL office is located, chose to attend Officer Islam’s funeral instead of the game. Islam, a familiar face providing security at the building, was remembered with deep emotion by the commissioner.“Tremendous loss,” Goodell said in an interview aired before the game. “You see the officer’s family, his young children… It hits home — the loss, the unnecessary and unexplainable loss.”A moment of silence before kickoff paid tribute to all four victims, which included Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman of Rudin Management.The shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire before taking his own life. He left behind a note criticizing the NFL for its handling of safety issues surrounding chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).Despite the chaos, Goodell found time to visit Craig Clementi, the NFL employee injured during the attack. “He is stable and improving,” Goodell shared. “I got to spend about an hour with him. (He) is an amazing young man… and we’re optimistic about his recovery.”Goodell’s tone was one of heartfelt solidarity and cautious optimism as he addressed the growing epidemic of violence. “This attack is far more than on several individuals. This is an attack on humanity. This is an attack on our communities. This is an attack on New York. This is an attack on our way of life.”The NFL temporarily closed its offices and encouraged employees to work remotely through August 8, prioritizing both safety and emotional recovery. A memo sent to staff urged them to “continue to take care of yourselves and one another.”“The NFL family is resilient and united,” the league said in its official statement. “Together, we will find strength in one another as we heal.”Goodell emphasized that football, even amidst sorrow, could offer a unifying force. “We do believe that the NFL brings people together,” he said. “This is the beginning of that process — making sure people can enjoy the National Football League.”The Chargers ultimately defeated the Lions 34-7, but the result paled in comparison to the emotional weight surrounding the game. For the NFL and its community, healing has just begun.On Monday, a gunman opened fire inside the Midtown Manhattan high-rise at 345 Park Avenue, which houses the NFL headquarters and other companies. Four people were killed, and one was seriously injured before the shooter took his own life.The deceased victims included NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne, and Rudin Management associate Julia Hyman.

Florida flags will fly low for Hulk Hogan Day



FAQs

Why did Florida declare August 1 as Hulk Hogan Day?

Where will flags be flown at half-staff?

What was the cause of Hulk Hogan’s death?

Florida is rolling out a hero’s sendoff for one of its most iconic residents. Governor Ron DeSantis has officially declared August 1, 2025, as “ Hulk Hogan Day” in the state, honoring the late wrestling superstar Terry Bollea, better known worldwide as Hulk Hogan. This tribute comes just days after Hogan died of a heart attack at the age of 71 in Clearwater, Florida.In a heartfelt move to celebrate Hogan’s legacy, Gov. DeSantis ordered flags across the state to be flown at half-staff on Friday, August 1, from sunrise to sunset. The directive includes the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee and all state and local government buildings throughout Pinellas County, in the region Hogan called home for much of his life.“In honor of a great Floridian, Hulk Hogan, we are lowering the flags at the capitol and Pinellas County tomorrow,” DeSantis stated. “Additionally, officially declaring tomorrow, August 1st, 2025, as ‘Hulk Hogan Day’ in Florida.”The wrestler, who was born in Augusta, Georgia, moved to Tampa at a young age and soon became a central figure in Florida's cultural landscape. His career began in 1977 and reached legendary status after joining WWE, where his larger-than-life persona, unforgettable catchphrases, and red-and-yellow gear made him a household name across generations.Hogan passed away on July 24 following a cardiac arrest. Emergency responders were called to his Clearwater home at 9:51 a.m. He was pronounced dead at 11:17 a.m. at a nearby hospital. Authorities confirmed there were no signs of foul play. “I strongly encourage everyone to keep the family in their thoughts, and please respect their privacy during this difficult time,” said Clearwater Police Maj. Nate Burnside.Hogan’s impact extended far beyond the wrestling ring. Inducted twice into the WWE Hall of Fame, first in 2005 and again in 2020 with the New World Order, he became one of the most recognized faces in sports entertainment. WWE acknowledged his passing with a tribute on social media: “WWE extends its condolences to Hogan’s family, friends, and fans.”A post on Hogan’s official Facebook page read, “May we all take solace in the wonderful memories he left behind for the millions of fans worldwide whose lives he touched for more than four decades. He will be missed, but never forgotten.”DeSantis’ official memo emphasized Hogan’s deep ties to Florida and noted his influence on both state pride and national pop culture. “His larger-than-life personality will be missed, as the ‘Hulkster’ was an icon for many who grew up in the 80s and 90s as well as today,” it read. “He was a true Floridian through and through.”Also Read: Triple H entertains White House with signature spit move as he hails Donald Trump’s Fitness Test revival: WATCH To honor Hulk Hogan’s legacy as a legendary wrestler and long-time Florida resident.At the State Capitol in Tallahassee and all local and state buildings in Pinellas County.Hogan died of a heart attack on July 24, 2025, in Clearwater, Florida.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has officially declared August 1, 2025, as “ Hulk Hogan Day’ in the state.

Hundreds gathered at a New York mosque on Thursday to commemorate a Bangladesh-born police officer who lost his life protecting his adopted city when a shooter attacked an office building this week.Officer Didarul Islam ""did believe in the American dream, not as something handed down but as something built with your own hands,"" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed Islam's community as officers stood in formation outside the Bronx religious centre.Officials and New York's Bangladeshi community members gathered to honour the deceased officer during a service that highlighted his dedication to family, heritage and public service.The 36-year-old officer, a married father of two expecting a third child, was conducting an NYPD-approved private security assignment in uniform when he and three others were fatally shot Monday at the Manhattan high-rise housing the NFL's headquarters and various corporate offices.""To our family, he was our world. To the city, he was a proud NYPD officer who served with compassion and integrity. He lived to help others,"" Islam's widow said in a message delivered by a family member at the Parkchester Jame Masjid mosque, according to the Associated Press.Officers positioned on nearby rooftops provided security whilst fire engines displayed a large American flag across the street. A vehicle carried a digital display showing Islam's photographs and a tribute from his union.After immigrating to the United States, Islam established his career in America's largest police department. He viewed policing as ""a blanket of the community, there to provide comfort and care,"" according to the police commissioner.Initially serving as a school safety agent, Islam became a patrol officer less than four years ago and received a posthumous promotion to detective on Thursday.""He could have gone into any other occupation he wanted, but he wanted to put on that uniform, and he wanted to protect fellow New Yorkers. And he wanted to let us know that he believed in what this city and what this country stood for,"" Mayor Eric Adams told attendees.In Washington, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commenced her briefing by conveying President Donald Trump's sympathies to Islam's family, noting he ""made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of his fellow New Yorkers.""Imam Zakir Ahmed emphasised the officer's immigrant background and Muslim faith, whilst noting Islam ""lived at a time when people like him are too often feared, vilified and made to feel like outsiders.""Following the service, attendees filled the streets for prayer, including Muslim officers, as their colleagues maintained formation behind them.The officer's casket, adorned with US and NYPD flags, was transported to Totowa, New Jersey, for burial.Julia Hyman, 27, another victim who worked at a real estate firm, was remembered at a Manhattan synagogue service on Wednesday.Funeral arrangements remain unannounced for security guard Aland Etienne and executive Wesley LePatner.Police identified Shane Tamura, 27, as the assailant, a former football player who recently worked in Las Vegas casino surveillance.

The White House said Thursday that work on a huge new ballroom, costing $200 million, will start in September and be completed by the conclusion of President Donald Trump's term in early 2029.It will be the most recent modification made to ""The People's House"" since the Republican president took office again in January. Additionally, it would mark the first structural alteration to the Executive Mansion since the Truman balcony was added in 1948.In addition to installing enormous flagpoles on the north and south lawns to fly the American flag, Trump has redecorated the Oval Office with cherubs and golden flourishes, as well as presidential portraits. A project to replace the Rose Garden's lawn with stone is presently being completed.For months, Trump has been promising to construct a ballroom, claiming that the White House lacks the space necessary for large gatherings and mocking the idea of holding state dinners with hundreds of guests in tents on the lawn, as previous administrations have done.About 200 people can be accommodated in the White House's largest room, the East space.“They’ve wanted a ballroom at the White House for more than 150 years but there’s never been a president that was good at ballrooms,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “I'm good at building things and we’re going to build quickly and on time. It’ll be beautiful, top, top of the line.”The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will be built where the East Wing sits with a seated capacity of 650 people. The East Wing houses several offices, including the first lady’s. Those offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.“Nothing will be torn down,” she said.Leavitt said at her briefing Thursday that Trump and other donors have committed to raising the approximately $200 million in construction costs. She did not name any of the other donors.Renderings of the look of future ballroom were posted on the White House website.Trump is also working on another project. In an interview with NBC News, he stated that he plans to replace the infamous Lincoln Bedroom's ""terribly"" renovated bathroom with one that is more in keeping with 19th-century design.","The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will be built where the East Wing sits with a seated capacity of 650 people.

The two countries were engaged in a deadly conflict that had displaced more than 300,000 people until President Trump stepped in to put an end to it.""""President Trump has brokered on average about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,"" she added.According to CNN, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who currently chairs ASEAN, announced the ceasefire agreement after facilitating discussions between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai near Kuala Lumpur.She said that the US President's direct communication with both prime ministers included a clear message that trade discussions would cease unless the conflict ended.This resulted in swift peace negotiations, preserving numerous lives and enabling trade talks to continue.Leavitt outlined Trump's involvement in resolving conflicts between various nations, including Israel-Iran, Rwanda-DRC, India-Pakistan, Serbia-Kosovo, and Egypt-Ethiopia. She highlighted that these achievements averaged one diplomatic success monthly during his six-month tenure.Regarding India-Pakistan relations, Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for de-escalating tensions following India's response to Pakistani aggression. However, India maintained its stance that matters concerning Jammu and Kashmir remain bilateral.Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Operation Sindoor discussion in Lok Sabha, stating, ""No leader in the world told India to stop its operation. On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back. The Vice President of America told me on the phone that Pakistan is going to launch a big attack. My answer was that if Pakistan has this intention, it will cost them a lot. If Pakistan attacks, we will respond by launching a big attack. This was my answer...""Operation Sindoor commenced on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoJK following the Pahalgam attack that claimed 26 civilian lives. India successfully countered Pakistan's military response and targeted its airbases.The hostilities concluded after Pakistan's DGMO contacted their Indian counterpart to establish a ceasefire.","US President Donald Trump has facilitated numerous peace agreements and ceasefires globally.

'MORAL DISTORTION'





The U.S. imposed sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization on Thursday, accusing them of undermining peace efforts with Israel even as other Western powers moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood.The State Department said it would deny visas for travel to the U.S. by those it was targeting, although it did not name any specific individuals.""It is in our national security interests to impose consequences and hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments and undermining the prospects for peace,"" the State Department said in a statement.The State Department said the two Palestinian organizations had ""taken actions to internationalize"" their conflict with Israel, including through the International Criminal Court, and said both had continued ""to support terrorism.""The PA and PLO serve as representatives for the Palestinian people and have long pushed for recognition of a Palestinian state by international organizations and foreign nations. The two groups had no immediate comment on the U.S. move.There are signs of a growing diplomatic divide over Palestinian statehood between Washington and three fellow Group of Seven allies.Late on Wednesday, Canada said it planned to recognize the State of Palestine at a meeting of the United Nations in September, ratcheting up pressure on Israel as starvation spreads in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza France said last week it would back Palestinian statehood and Britain said on Tuesday it would do the same at September's U.N. General Assembly meeting if the fighting in Gaza had not stopped by then.U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted that recognition of Palestinian statehood would wrongly reward Hamas, the militant group that is battling Israel in the Gaza Strip. Since returning to office in January, he has been vague about his position on a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Israel has denounced the moves by France, Britain and Canada.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, in a post on X, thanked the U.S. for its ""moral clarity"" in sanctioning the Palestinian officials, saying the action ""also exposes the moral distortion of certain countries that ran to recognise a virtual Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to its support for terror and incitement.""State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott declined to say whether Thursday's U.S. action was linked to or in retaliation for the three countries' plans to recognize the State of Palestine.Asked about the timing, he told a regular media briefing that the sanctions resulted from a report to Congress from a twice-a-year review of Palestinian compliance with their commitments.It was not immediately clear how the U.S. visa ban would affect Palestinian diplomats.Under the 1947 U.N. ""headquarters agreement,"" the U.S. is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the U.N. in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons.Pigott said waivers of the visa sanctions could be considered on a case-by-case basis.The U.S. sanctions follow an international conference this week at the U.N., hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, that aimed to work towards a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel and the U.S. boycotted the event.Also on Thursday, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to salvage Gaza truce talks and tackle a humanitarian crisis in the enclave, where a global hunger monitor has warned that famine is unfolding.The Gaza war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel's offensive has killed more than 60,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to Gaza health officials, reduced much of the enclave to ruins and displaced nearly the entire population.","U.S. imposes sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear that he wants a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine by August 8, the United States told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday.“Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,” senior U.S. diplomat John Kelley told the 15-member council.Trump said on Tuesday that the United States would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia ""10 days from today"" if Moscow showed no progress toward ending its war in Ukraine.Kyiv and Moscow have held three rounds of talks in Istanbul this year that yielded exchanges of prisoners and bodies, but no breakthrough to defuse the more than three-year conflict.""We intend to continue the negotiations in Istanbul,"" Russia’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told the council, but he added: “Despite the meetings in Istanbul, in the West, the war party did not go away ... We continue hearing voices of those who think that diplomacy is just a way of criticizing Russia and exerting pressure on it.""Ukraine’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn said Russia must be confronted with ""unity, resolve and action.""""We seek a comprehensive, just and lasting peace grounded in the principles of the U.N. Charter and nothing less. We repeat - a full, immediate and unconditional ceasefire is essential.

In a midnight social media post, President Donald Trump called Dmitry Medvedev a ""failed former President of Russia"" who had better ""watch his words.""Less than three hours later -- morning by then in Moscow -- Medvedev responded. He said Trump should picture the apocalyptic television series ""The Walking Dead"" and referred to the Soviet Union's system for launching a last-ditch, automatic nuclear strike.""Russia is right about everything and will continue to go its own way,"" said Medvedev's post on the Telegram messaging app.It was the second time this summer that Trump and Medvedev, Russia's head of state from 2008 to 2012, traded blows on social media.The exchanges have been striking not only for the verbal brinkmanship on display between the world's nuclear superpowers, but also for the mismatched stature of the figures involved. While Trump commands the world's most powerful military, Medvedev is widely seen as a social-media attack dog relegated to the periphery of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.The viciousness of the overnight exchange highlighted the volatility and opacity of a geopolitical relationship in which Trump and Putin set policy largely on their own.And it put on display the combustible mix that can occur when the Kremlin's long-standing willingness to use nuclear threats meets Trump's penchant for late-night diatribes on the internet. Hanging in the balance is the future of Ukraine, three years into Russia's full-scale invasion.""In wars, traditionally diplomatic messaging is something that's done with a lot of care and discipline,"" said Michael Kimmage, a professor at Catholic University in Washington who specializes in the U.S.-Russia relationship. ""The consequences of screwing up can be so huge.""Grigorii Golosov, a professor of political science at the European University in St. Petersburg, Russia, said there was something symbiotic about Trump and Medvedev fighting on social media. Medvedev, who had styled himself as a pro-Western liberal when he served as president more than a decade ago, has recast himself as an uncompromising soldier in Russia's showdown with the West.But attacking Medvedev may also be useful to Trump, Golosov posited, by allowing him to show he's getting tough on Russia without attacking Putin directly. In June, Trump attacked Medvedev for saying countries could send nuclear warheads to Iran, adding: ""I guess that's why Putin's 'THE BOSS.'""This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Donald Trump called Dmitry Medvedev a ""failed former President of Russia"" less than three hours later.

The White House announced Thursday that it will begin the construction of the “White House State Ballroom,” a major new addition to the presidential complex aimed at addressing long-standing space limitations for official events.The $200 million project, funded by US President Donald Trump and private donors, is set to begin in September and will be built on the site of the current East Wing—a structure originally constructed in 1902 and later modified.Spanning approximately 90,000 square feet, the ballroom will seat up to 650 guests, more than triple the capacity of the current East Room.Construction is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s current term.""For 150 years, Presidents, Administrations, and White House Staff have longed for a large event space on the White House complex that can hold substantially more guests than currently allowed,” the White House said in a statement.“President Donald J Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people.""Currently, major functions are hosted under temporary tents set up about 100 yards from the main building.The new permanent structure will eliminate the need for such installations while maintaining architectural consistency with the historic residence.""The White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major functions honouring world leaders and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building entrance"", the statement said.""The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it's theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,” it added.Trump has held meetings with officials from the White House staff, national park service, White House military office, and the US secret service to finalise the design and planning. The US secret service will provide security enhancements.The project will be led by McCrery Architects, a Washington-based firm known for its classical design work. “I am honoured that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People’s House,” said CEO Jim McCrery. Clark Construction will serve as the general contractor, with AECOM heading the engineering team.“President Trump is a builder at heart and has an extraordinary eye for detail,” the statement said, citing White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. “The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organisations to preserve the special history of the White House.”","The White House announced Thursday that it will begin the construction of the “White House State Ballroom,” a major new addition to the presidential complex.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Dawn





Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation and regional stability.""","Pakistan army chief Asim Munir is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data. Despite these soaring numbers, Pakistanis rarely featured among the top 10 nationalities crossing into Britain via small boats, suggesting they were entering through legal visa channels, and staying there.","Visa fraud network being run by some Pakistani consultants exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system. forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.
