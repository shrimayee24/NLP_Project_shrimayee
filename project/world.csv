Pakistan-based terror outfits could use Nepal to launch attacks on India: Nepalese official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-based-terror-outfits-could-use-nepal-to-launch-attacks-on-india-nepalese-official/articleshow/122397764.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a blunt warning that has confirmed the worst fears of Indian security establishment, a senior Nepalese govt advisor has cautioned that Pakistan-based terrorist organisations were likely to exploit Nepal's geography to launch attacks on India.During a seminar on challenges to regional peace and security in South Asia in Kathmandu, Sunil Bahadur Thapa, principal political advisor to the president of Nepal and former minister of industry, said Pakistan-based UN-designated terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) posed risks to India and could potentially use Nepal as a transit point for their nefarious objectives.The vulnerability of Nepal to terrorism was highlighted through specific incidents, such as hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu.Pakistani terrorist groups have been known to utilise Nepal as a transit route to infiltrate into India. Notable cases include the arrest of Abdul Karim Tunda, a top LeT operative involved in over 40 bombings in India, who was held on the India-Nepal border in 2013. The case of Mirza Dilshad Beg, an assassinated Indian-Nepali parliamentarian who had links with Dawood Ibrahim's D-company and ISI, is another case in point.Yasin Bhatkal, co-founder of Indian Mujahideen, was apprehended by Nepal police in 2013 and handed over to Indian authorities. In April 2024, Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) had arrested two Pakistani nationals - Mohammed Altaf Bhat and Sayyed Gajanfar - along with their aide Nasir Ali, near the Nepal border.A Nepalese citizen was among those who were targeted on the basis of their Hindu faith by jihadis in Pahalgam in April this year.The seminar, organised by Nepal Institute for International Cooperation & Engagement, brought together experts, policymakers and former officials to discuss the threat of terrorism in the region. Speakers emphasised that terrorism in the region has far-reaching consequences, including economic losses, and hindered regional integration and stressed the need for global unity and cooperation to combat terrorism, citing the importance of intelligence sharing and joint border patrolling between India and Nepal.Speakers at the seminar included Thapa; Minendra Rijal, former defence minister of Nepal; Chanda Chaudhary, member of Parliament; Shisir Khanal, former minister; Dinesh Bhattarai, former diplomat; N P Saud, former minister of foreign affairs; Purna Silwal, former major general of the Nepal army; and Madhu Raman Acharya, former foreign secretary of Nepal.","Sunil Bahadur Thapa said Pakistan-based UN-designated terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) posed risks to India.

Tharoor's praise, fuel for BJP

NEW DELHI: The conspicuous tension between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress party has become more pronounced as the Kerala unit leaders launched a scathing attack on the Thiruvananthapuram MP after he pitched himself as the CM face for the state polls due next year.Ambitious Tharoor, who had earlier thrown his hat into the Congress presidential race, a move that reportedly left a sour taste for the Gandhis, once again stirred the pot on Wednesday by sharing a survey that found 28.3 per cent of respondents saw him as the most suitable leader for the state.The post by Thaoor triggered a reaction from the Kerala Congress unit, with senior party leader K Muraleedharan taking a swipe at Thaoor, saying ""he should first decide which party he belongs to"".""Even if someone else is leading in the survey, if the UDF comes to power in the 2026 Assembly polls, the chief minister will be from the UDF,"" Muraleedharan told reporters on Thursday, reacting to a query on Tharoor's post on 'X'.""Our aim is to win the elections. We are not interested in such unnecessary controversies,"" he said.Amid growing rumblings within the Congress, senior leader Muraleedharan sought to downplay talk of Shashi Tharoor emerging as the party’s chief ministerial face in Kerala.""There are several senior leaders in the Kerala unit of Congress who would be in consideration for the post of CM, irrespective of what any survey says,"" he said.Muraleedharan added that the party follows a defined internal process: ""The party has a framework of rules according to which a decision would be taken as to who would be the next CM.""Another Kerala leader, Ramesh Chennithala, said it was not correct for the Congress Working Committee (CWC) member to praise PM Modi.""One thing is very clear, a Member of Parliament and a member of the CWC cannot praise the Prime Minister. It is not correct. It is painful for all the Congress workers and leaders in Kerala and throughout the country... It is a very serious issue,"" Chennithala told news agency ANI.The rift between Tharoor and the Congress high command appears to have deepened, particularly after his reaction to the recent terror attack in Pahalgam. His remarks drew sharp internal criticism, with some in the party accusing him of putting the Congress on the defensive at a sensitive time.Kerala is set to go to polls in April next year, as the five-year term of the second LDF government, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) veteran Pinarayi Vijayan , comes to an end.","Kerala unit leaders launch scathing attack on the Thiruvananthapuram MP after he pitched himself as the CM face for the state polls due next year.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off slapping a canteen worker over “stale food,” Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Friday upped the ante by publicly threatening AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel.“I will beat Imtiaz Jaleel so badly that he will not be in a position to run a hotel,” Gaikwad told news agency PTI, reacting to Jaleel’s criticism of the assault.The original incident began when Gaikwad, a two-time MLA from Buldhana, ordered dinner on Tuesday night and claimed the dal and rice were stale and foul-smelling. Enraged, he stormed into the canteen, forced a worker to smell the food, and slapped and punched him. A video of the assault soon went viral, prompting condemnation from across the political spectrum and sparking a debate on legislators' conduct.Also read: Case registered against Shiv Sena MLA for slapping canteen worker; 2 days after viral video Jaleel, a former MP and the Maharashtra state president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, condemned Gaikwad’s actions. “Beating a poor person in such a way is not right,” he said.Responding to Gaikwad's threat, Jaleel said, “Gaikwad has a history of fighting. If he is threatening me, then let me know the time and place. He doesn’t need to make an effort, I will reach that place… I have nothing to do with Sanjay Gaikwad, but if you are doing wrong… then I will stand with the poor person.”Jaleel also remarked that Gaikwad should have written a letter to the Speaker instead of resorting to violence.“Had Gaikwad been a bit educated, he would have written a letter to the Speaker. If the Speaker takes him seriously, he would have acted,” he added.On Friday, police registered a non-cognisable offence against Gaikwad and one of his supporters under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita relating to voluntarily causing hurt and common intention. As the offence is minor, police cannot arrest the accused without court permission.Despite backlash, Gaikwad remained unapologetic. “I punched him twice. If needed, I will do it again,” he said, justifying his actions by accusing the canteen of “playing with people’s lives.” Following the incident, the Maharashtra FDA suspended the canteen’s licence, citing food safety violations.","Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Friday threatened AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious Mexican drug lord “El Chapo” pleaded guilty on Friday (local time) to drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is the first of El Chapo’s sons to agree to a plea deal with US prosecutors.Prosecutors say Ovidio and his brother, Joaquín Guzmán López, led a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the “Chapitos” or “little Chapos.” Authorities described their operation as a major effort to smuggle huge amounts of fentanyl into the US, contributing to tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year.As part of the plea deal, Ovidio admitted to overseeing the production and trafficking of cocaine, heroin , methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US. He also pleaded guilty to money laundering and firearms charges connected to his leadership role in the cartel.The specific terms of the agreement, including possible sentencing reductions or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed. However, officials said sentencing has been delayed as Ovidio cooperates with US authorities.His lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he would wait until sentencing before discussing whether it was a good deal.Lichtman also pointed out that the case against Ovidio’s brother Joaquín is different and might take longer to resolve.“Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” Lichtman said.Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said Ovidio’s guilty plea might have helped protect his family members.“In this way, he has some control over who he’s cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”Levenson described the plea deal as a “big step” for the US government.Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized what she called a “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels. She pointed out the contradiction between the US labeling cartels as foreign terrorist organizations while also making plea deals with their leaders.Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He had first pleaded not guilty but signaled in recent months that he would change his plea.His father, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, is serving a life sentence in the US after being convicted in 2019 for leading the Sinaloa cartel and having smuggled massive amount of cocaine and other drugs into the United States for over 25 years.","Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious Mexican drug lord “El Chapo” pleaded guilty on Friday (local time) to drug trafficking charges in the United States.

SAN SALVADOR: Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele said Friday he appreciated Mexico's ""clarification"" that a cocaine-packed plane it intercepted did not in fact originate in El Salvador, a claim that had hiked diplomatic tensions between the nations.Earlier in the week, Mexico's security chief said authorities had detected a small plane ""originating in El Salvador"" carrying 428 kilos (940 pounds) of cocaine.Bukele called the claim ""FALSE,"" recalled his ambassador to Mexico for consultations and demanded ""rectification"" from the Mexican government.On Friday, he posted on X what appeared to be a letter from Mexico's foreign affairs ministry, outlining in red one paragraph.""The Ministry regrets the events of July 8 and states that there is no evidence that the flight of said aircraft originated in El Salvador,"" or that any El Salvadoran was involved, the letter said.Mexican security secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch hastened the same day to clarify that the aircraft had been detected in El Salvador's airspace.Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum weighed in Thursday, saying, ""There's no need to turn this into a political issue.""Central America is a gateway for cocaine sent from South American cartels to the United States, the world's largest consumer of the drug.""El Salvador does not hide criminals or tolerate drug trafficking.

FBI Director Kash Patel is considering resigning, according to a report by The Daily Wire, in a deepening dispute within the Justice Department over the handling of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.“Source close to DOJ says Kash Patel also wants Pam Bondi gone, and that he’d consider leaving if Bongino leaves. Also that there are more frustrations with other documents Bondi hasn’t released,” Daily Wire reporter Mary Margaret Olohan wrote on X.Patel’s possible resignation follows growing speculation that FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino may also step down. Bongino has reportedly told people close to him that he is thinking about leaving his post after a major clash with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Epstein case.Media reports suggest Patel is furious with Bondi’s handling of the Epstein files. He is said to be frustrated that Bondi has not unsealed more records related to the case and has told associates he wants her removed from her position.According to The Daily Wire, Patel is prepared to leave the FBI if Bongino resigns.Patel has publicly stated that the FBI’s review of evidence showed that Epstein was not murdered, pushing back against conspiracy theories about Epstein’s 2019 death in jail.The controversy erupted after the FBI and DOJ issued a joint memo declaring the Epstein case officially closed, stating he died by suicide and there was no evidence of homicide. The announcement angered many MAGA commentators including FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino who refuse to accept that there is no “client list” of powerful individuals who visited Epstein’s island or were involved in sex trafficking of minors.For years, Patel and Bongino have suggested there was more to be revealed about the Epstein case. Bondi herself previously claimed she had an Epstein “client list” on her desk for review. However, after the case was closed, Bondi clarified that she was referring to the broader set of Epstein-related documents, not a specific client list.","FBI Director Kash Patel is considering resigning, according to a report by The Daily Wire.

The Big Picture







The Trump administration is facing its most volatile internal crisis yet, as FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino edges closer to resignation over Attorney General Pam Bondi’s mishandling of the long-anticipated Epstein files. The fallout, driven by Bondi’s broken promises and growing public outrage, has FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly prepared to follow Bongino out the door—setting the stage for a possible leadership implosion at the heart of American law enforcement.This internal war—once quietly brewing—is now on full display, with recriminations flying, alliances shifting, and MAGA loyalists turning on their own.On July 7, the Department of Justice issued a memo that decisively undercut the narrative Bondi had been peddling for months. The two-page document concluded there was no evidence of a “client list,” no credible signs of blackmail, and reaffirmed the long-standing official position that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail cell in 2019.The memo, signed off by both DOJ and FBI leadership, included surveillance footage and investigative summaries that contradicted Bondi’s earlier statements. For months, she had claimed the FBI was in possession of tens of thousands of hours of disturbing video footage, and had repeatedly promised bombshell disclosures.Those promises now appear to have been hollow.Conservative influencers, who had banked on explosive revelations implicating elites, were incensed. Bondi’s office had built expectations with Phase 1 of the “Epstein Files” back in February—a series of binders handed out to right-wing media figures that mostly repackaged previously leaked information. With the July memo’s flat conclusions, fury erupted.The conflict between Bongino and Bondi came to a head on July 9 during a closed-door White House meeting. Bondi accused Bongino of leaking frustrations to the press, an allegation he denied. Witnesses described the exchange as heated and personal, with Bongino storming out of the room.Two days later, Bongino took a personal day and has not returned. Multiple administration sources now say his resignation is imminent. One source described him as “done,” and unwilling to work another day under Bondi’s leadership. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and a fixture in conservative media, had reluctantly endorsed the DOJ memo’s suicide conclusion, only to be caught in the backlash from MAGA influencers who accused him of selling out.FBI Director Kash Patel is also said to be considering resignation. Once a key proponent of theories questioning Epstein’s death, Patel has since aligned with the suicide explanation in his official capacity. However, insiders say he is privately furious at Bondi for damaging the Bureau’s credibility and igniting a crisis within the administration.Patel’s calculus is reportedly tied to Bongino’s fate. If his deputy resigns, Patel may follow, seeing little institutional value in continuing under Bondi’s divisive leadership. One aide close to the director said, “He doesn’t want to be left holding the bag. If Bongino goes, Kash walks too.”Bondi, once lionised by MAGA world as a crusading truth-teller, now finds herself isolated. Online, influencers and activists who once supported her are accusing her of deceit. Hashtags attacking her flooded conservative corners of social media in the days following the memo’s release. Even voices that typically defend the Trump administration have begun to call for her resignation.What makes the backlash particularly potent is that Bondi had personally staked her reputation on the idea that the Epstein files contained smoking guns. Now that official documentation has concluded otherwise, she has lost the confidence of both the public and senior officials inside the administration.Donald Trump has so far refused to intervene. During a cabinet meeting on July 8, he reportedly urged his team to “move on” from the Epstein issue, calling it a distraction from his legislative agenda. While the president continues to publicly back Bondi, insiders say he’s well aware of her declining utility. Trump’s political instincts have always been sharper than his personal loyalties—and Bondi may soon find herself on the wrong side of that calculation.This isn’t just about Epstein. It’s about trust, credibility, and the fault lines within the Trump-era security state. Bondi’s promise of transparency has backfired, alienating the very audience it was meant to appease. Bongino’s looming exit and Patel’s wavering loyalty signal a broader collapse of cohesion at the top. With two of the administration’s most prominent law enforcement figures ready to walk and the base in open revolt, Pam Bondi’s position may no longer be tenable. And while the Epstein case may be officially closed, the political aftershocks are far from over.",The Trump administration is facing its most volatile internal crisis yet.

'Unconstitutional tactics': US federal judge blocks ICE raids in California counties; Trump admin accused of racial profiling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unconstitutional-tactics-us-federal-judge-blocks-ice-raids-in-california-counties-trump-admin-accused-of-racial-profiling/articleshow/122398914.cms,"US federal judge blocks ICE raids in California counties (Image credits: AP)





A US federal judge ordered the Donald Trump administration to halt broad immigration stops and arrests across seven California counties, including Los Angeles, following allegations of racial profiling and “unconstitutional tactics” by federal immigration agents.Attorneys general from 18 Democratic-led states supported the court orders, which came after a similar ruling in April that barred warrantless arrests by border agents in parts of eastern California.The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Maame E Frimpong, came after immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit accusing US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) of detaining brown-skinned individuals.The lawsuit names three detained immigrants and two US citizens, one of whom was held despite showing valid identification.Plaintiffs claim agents targeted individuals who “looked Hispanic” or wore construction work clothes.

US state department layoffs: Trump administration orders workforce reduction; over 1300 employees affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-state-department-layoffs-trump-administration-orders-workforce-reduction-over-1300-employees-affected/articleshow/122398722.cms,"The headquarters of the Department of State (AP image)





The US State Department on Friday (local time) laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%. This is part of a broader effort to reorganize the department.According to a notice sent to State department employees, the layoffs include 1107 civil service employees and 246 foreign service officers. Overall, nearly 3000 people are expected to leave.The department is also rearranging the organizational structure of staff. These layoffs, officially called a “reduction-in-force” or RIF, have been planned for months. Officials sent the reorganization plan to Congress in March, saying the cuts were necessary to remove duplicate offices and focus on the department’s core responsibilities.However, critics argue the cuts will hurt the State Department’s ability to work. All Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday opposing the layoffs.""During a time of increasingly complex and wide-spread challenges to U.S. national security, this administration should be strengthening our diplomatic corps—an irreplaceable instrument of U.S. power and leadership—not weakening it,"" the senators wrote.""However, RIFs would severely undermine the Department's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy interests, putting our nation's security, strength, and prosperity at risk,"" the letter added, as reported by news agency CBS.Foreign service officers who received layoff notices will leave their jobs in 120 days, while civil service employees will depart in 60 days.The long planned layoffs began just days after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration’s broader plan to slash the size of government workforce, overruling a lower court's order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.Department staff were notified about the upcoming layoffs on Thursday afternoon in a message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas, who thanked departing staff ""for their dedication and service to the United States.""Some employees were instructed that because of the planned layoffs, they would not be allowed to work remotely on Friday. They were told to report to the office with all department-issued items, including laptops, phones, diplomatic passports, travel cards and other government property. An email explained that badges would be collected during the checkout process and reminded staff to gather any personal belongings beforehand.Diplomats and other staff applauded departing colleagues in emotional scenes at the State Department’s Washington headquarters that runs US foreign policy and embassies around the world.The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing State Department employees, criticized the move as a “catastrophic blow to our national interests.”""At a moment of great global instability -- with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order -- the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,"" AFSA said in a statement.""We oppose this decision in the strongest terms,"" the statement added.","US State Department laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%.

They are necessary for immigration enforcement. They should be more respectful of individual rights





A dramatic standoff unfolded inside a Southern California surgical center when ICE agents chased a Honduran landscaper into the facility, allegedly without a warrant, triggering a confrontation with stunned clinic staff.In a viral video from Tuesday’s incident, medical workers in scrubs can be seen physically shielding the man, who was crying and gasping for breath, while demanding agents show identification and legal grounds for detention.“Get your hands off of him. You don't even have a warrant. Let him go. You need to get out,” AP reported quoting a staff member.Immigration advocate Javier Hernandez confirmed that ICE agents ultimately arrested the Honduran man, whose whereabouts remain unknown. The man had been supporting his mother’s dialysis treatments back home.Hernandez cast doubt on ICE’s claim that the operation was targeted, noting that two of the man’s co-workers were also questioned until their legal status was verified. “There’s so many videos now that are out there. It's getting harder ... because the tactics are getting more violent,” AP quoted him saying.ICE has become more visible in migrant detentions, even arresting people at courts and workplaces. After two such incidents at parish properties, the San Bernardino bishop excused parishioners from Mass. DHS claimed agents were targeting two undocumented men in Ontario when one, a 30-year-old Honduran, fled into a surgery center. Officials accused staff of assaulting agents and obstructing the arrest.","A Honduran landscaper was chased into a Southern California surgical center by ICE agents without a warrant.

Internet erupted in disbelief after 40-year-old MAGA commentator Nick Adams posted a video thanking President Donald Trump for the 'honor of a lifetime'. Social media users looked for official confirmation before dismissing it as a prank and found out that indeed Trump nominated the MAGA troll as the US ambassador to Malaysia. Adams has no prior experience in diplomacy though he has experience in politics but in Australia where he was born. In 2005, he became Australia's youngest ever deputy mayor when he was elected to help run suburban Ashfield.Out of his many peculiar policies, Adams wanted to ban pigeons and wanted to use DNA testing to track down dog owners who failed to clean up after their pets.“Mr. President, thank you for the honor of a lifetime. In your America, all dreams come true. It will be my honor to represent the United States of America in Malaysia,” Adams said in a clip posted to X on Thursday. “To the esteemed Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to a confirmation process that is at the heart of the Constitution that has given me the freedom to pursue the American Dream.”Adams is known for incendiary comments like he calls himself an ""alpha male"", called Taylor Swift ""woke Jezebel"" etc.“I go to Hooters. I eat rare steaks. I lift extremely heavy weights. I read the Bible every night. I am pursued by copious amounts of women. I am wildly successful. I have the physique of a Greek God. I have an IQ over 180. I am extremely charismatic. They hate this,"" Adams once said.""Imagine the Malaysian government finding out their ambassador from the US is Nick Adams,"" one user wrote while another commented that US was basically deporting him to Malaysia.Many people commented that they used to think that Nick Adams was not a real person and a parody account on X.South China Morning Post reported that Nick Adams could be a very wrong fit for Muslim-majority Malaysia which favors quiet diplomacy over headline-grabbing rhetoric. “It’s a surprising pick that favours political loyalists over those who actually fit the post,” the newspaper quotes an unnamed diplomat based in the Malaysian capital as saying.","Trump nominates Nick Adams as Malaysia ambassador.

WASHINGTON - The United States is selling weapons to its NATO allies in Europe so they can provide them to Ukraine as it struggles to fend off a recent escalation in Russia's drone and missile attacks, President Donald Trump and his chief diplomat said.""We're sending weapons to NATO, and NATO is paying for those weapons, 100%,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC News late Thursday. ""So what we're doing is, the weapons that are going out are going to NATO, and then NATO is going to be giving those weapons (to Ukraine), and NATO is paying for those weapons.""Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. Those weapons could be transferred to Ukraine, with European countries buying replacements from the U.S., he said.""It's a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a (U.S.) factory and get it there,"" Rubio told reporters during a visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Ukraine badly needs more U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russian ballistic and cruise missiles.The Trump administration has gone back and forth about providing more vital military aid to Ukraine more than three years into Russia's invasion.After a brief pause in some weapons shipments, Trump said he would keep sending defensive weapons to Ukraine. U.S. officials said this week that some were on their way.Details still are being worked out on Trump's plan NATO itself doesn't send weapons to Ukraine or otherwise own or handle arms - that is done by its 32 member nations - but it does coordinate the deliveries of weapons to a logistics hub in Poland, bordering Ukraine. The alliance itself ships items like medical supplies and fuel.""Allies continue to work to ensure that Ukraine has the support they need to defend themselves against Russia's aggression,"" NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said. ""This includes urgent efforts to procure key supplies from the United States, including air defense and ammunition.""Germany, Spain and other European countries possess Patriot missile systems, and some have placed orders for more, Rubio said.The U.S. is encouraging its NATO allies to provide ""the defensive systems that Ukraine seeks ... since they have them in their stocks, and then we can enter into financial agreements with them, with us, where they can purchase the replacements,"" Rubio said.A senior NATO military official said Trump spoke to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte about the plan but noted that the details were ""still being worked out.""U.S. weapons already in Europe could be transferred to Ukraine under Trump's proposal, as could American-made weapons previously purchased by allies.""NATO has effective mechanisms in place to make something like this possible,"" the official said.A senior European defense official said it was their understanding that European nations would purchase U.S. weapons for Ukraine under the plan.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Ukraine is seeking more coveted Patriot air defense systems Russia has recently sought to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses by launching major aerial attacks. This week, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones at Ukraine, topping previous barrages for the third time in two weeks.Ukraine has asked other countries to supply it with an additional 10 Patriot systems and missiles, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday. Germany is ready to provide two systems, and Norway has agreed to supply one, he said.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Thursday that officials ""stand ready to acquire additional Patriot systems from the U.S. and make them available to Ukraine.""Asked how many Patriot systems Germany is interested in buying, Merz didn't give a number. But he said he spoke to Trump a week ago ""and asked him to deliver these systems.""In addition to the Patriots, the weaponry that could be sold to NATO members includes advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles, shorter-range missiles and Howitzer rounds, according to a person familiar with the internal White House debate. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private discussions.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment seeking more details.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has been in touch with Trump in recent days, said it's in U.S. national security interests to sell weapons to Ukraine, and ""Europe can pay for them.""""We have the best weapons. They sure as hell know how to use them,"" Graham said in an AP interview in Rome while attending a meeting on the sidelines of a Ukraine recovery conference.Allies purchasing U.S. weapons for Ukraine would get around a possible stalemate in funding for Kyiv once an aid package approved last year runs out. Even with broad support in Congress for backing Ukraine, it's unclear if more funding would be approved.Trump's evolving stance on Putin Trump's efforts to facilitate Ukraine's weapon supply come as he has signaled his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin . At a Cabinet meeting this week, he said he was ""not happy"" with Putin over a conflict that was ""killing a lot of people"" on both sides.Russia's bigger army is pressing hard on parts of the 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line, where thousands of soldiers on both sides have died since the Kremlin ordered the invasion in February 2022.Graham says Trump has given him the go-ahead to push forward with a bill he's co-sponsoring that calls, in part, for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil. Trump said Tuesday that he's ""looking at it very strongly.""In the NBC News interview, Trump teased that he will make a major announcement on Russia next week.The U.S. president also has had a tumultuous relationship with Zelenskyy, which reached a low point during an Oval Office blowup in February when Trump berated him for being ""disrespectful."" The relationship has since shown signs of rebounding.The two leaders spoke by phone last week about Ukraine's air defenses. Zelenskyy said Thursday that talks with Trump have been ""very constructive.""Impact of the latest Russian attacks In the latest attacks, a Russian drone barrage targeted the center of Kharkiv just before dawn Friday, injuring nine people and damaging a maternity hospital in Ukraine's second-largest city, officials said.""There is no silence in Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. A daytime drone attack on the southern city of Odesa also injured nine.Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, has endured repeated and intensifying drone attacks in recent weeks, as have many other regions of the country, mostly at night.Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's Western partners to quickly follow through on pledges they made at the international meeting in Rome on Thursday. Ukraine needs more interceptor drones to bring down Russian-made Shahed drones, he said.Authorities said Friday that they're establishing a comprehensive drone interception system under a project called Clear Sky. It includes a $6.2 million investment in interceptor drones, operator training and new mobile response units, the Kyiv Military Administration said.""We found a solution. ... That's the key,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We need financing. And then, we will intercept.""","NEW: U.S. is selling weapons to its NATO allies in Europe so they can provide them to Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says some of the weapons are deployed with NATO allies. The weapons could be transferred to Ukraine, with European countries buying replacements.

F ederal immigration officials said Friday that approximately 200 people suspected of being in the US illegally were arrested during raids on two marijuana farms in California. The operations, which took place on Thursday in Carpinteria and Camarillo, led to a tense standoff between protesters and authorities at one of the sites, according to the Associated Press.The raids were carried out by federal agents, and a chaotic scene unfolded outside Glass House Farms in Camarillo as large crowds gathered to inquire about their loved ones and protest the immigration enforcement. Glass House, which cultivates tomatoes, cucumbers, and licensed marijuana, stated that authorities had valid warrants.“Glass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,” the farm said in a statement.In a separate statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said agents had executed criminal search warrants at both locations. At least 10 immigrant children were reportedly present during the raids.Four US citizens were arrested on charges of “assaulting or resisting officers,” according to the department.Authorities also announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired at federal agents during the operation.The raids began Thursday morning when immigration officers arrived at the farms. Workers alerted their families, prompting relatives and immigrant advocates to travel to the Camarillo location, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Many gathered outside to demand information and protest the operation.Federal agents in camouflage uniforms, helmets, and gas masks set up a roadblock leading to the farm’s greenhouses. Protesters shouted at the agents, and smoke from canisters forced the crowd to retreat. It was unclear whether the agents deployed tear gas or other chemical agents.Ventura County fire authorities reported receiving 911 calls from people struggling to breathe. Several individuals were rushed to local hospitals.The family of Jaime Alanis, a tomato picker who had worked at the farm for over a decade, said he phoned his wife in Mexico during the raid, telling her he was hiding on the property with others as immigration agents arrived.According to his niece, Yesenia, Alanis is suffering from a fractured skull, a broken neck, and a ruptured artery supplying blood to the brain. “They told us he won’t make it and to say goodbye,” she said, as reported by AP.During the operation, several workers were arrested and transported by bus. Others, including US citizens, were detained at the site for several hours as the investigation continued.In its Friday statement, DHS said the investigation into potential immigration and child labor violations at the farm is ongoing. Authorities have not disclosed further details about the specific allegations.Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated, “We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who assaults or doxes federal law enforcement.”","About 200 people suspected of being in the US illegally were arrested during raids on two marijuana farms in California.

Infighting among Dan Bongino, Kash Patel and Pam Bondi



Will Dan Bongino resign?

'Dan Bongino, Pam Bondi to resign, Kash Patel to continue'



Who is Dan Bongino?





FBI deputy director Dan Bongino told people close to him that he was considering resigning after he had a major clash with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Epstein case, CNN reported. The DOJ and the FBI jointly issued a memo this week closing the investigation into convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide in 2019 in his prison cell. After years of promising explosive documents, the DOJ and the FBI said they have no new documents to produce apart from child pornography which they won't release; they also said Epstein did not have any list of high-profile contacts whom he was threatening.The administration also released 10-hour surveillance footage from outside Epstein's cell to prove that no one came there before Epstein committed suicide and so there was no room for foul play.A trusted lieutenant of FBI director Kash Patel, Dan Bongino has been fighting all the criticisms that came the FBI's way. While all three of them faced the heat for overpromising for years, Dan Bongino had a clash with Pam Bondi at a White House meeting.Bongino was also blamed for approving the release of the footage which had a one-minute gap. When Bongino reviewed the footage, he did not flag the issue that the one-minute gap would raise suspicion.Pam Bondi explained that the gap was because the system in 2019 needed a reboot every day and that gap is there in all footage.Bongino was also blamed for a NewsNation report that claimed Kash Patel would have released the documents much earlier, if he had the authority. This implied that Pam Bondi sat on the documents and raised people's hope that some explosive revelations were coming out while Kash Patel could have revealed the truth long before.Dan Bongino said he was not behind the NewsNation report.CNN reported that Bongino spoke about a possible resignation but has not made up his mind. And it's possible that he may continue in his position.The MAGA world threw their support to Bongino and instead wanted Pam Bondi to be sacrificed for the 'botch-up'. A major drama began Friday after it was reported that Bongino did not come to work Friday. “The whole thing has been a complete mess and no one is happy,” CNN reported citing sources.Right-wing commentator Alex Jones claimed both Dan Bongino and Pam Bondi will resign while Kash Patel will continue heading the FBI. He said he got the intel from multiple FBI sources. Both Pam Bondi and Dan Bongino are on their way out soon, if not now, Alex Jones said.Before becoming the deputy director, Dan Bongino was a conservative political commentator, radio show host, author, and former Secret Service agent. Born on December 4, 1974, in New York City, Bongino first gained national attention through his law enforcement and federal service career. He worked with the New York City Police Department before joining the United States Secret Service, where he served during the administrations of Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama. After leaving the Secret Service in 2011, Bongino launched a political career, running unsuccessfully for Congress multiple times as a Republican in Maryland and Florida.Bongino hosted The Dan Bongino Show, a popular podcast and radio program, and also had affiliations with Fox News, though he parted ways with the network in 2023.","FBI deputy director Dan Bongino told people close to him that he was considering resigning after he had a major clash with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Epstein case.

What is ' missing minute '?







The 10-hour raw video showing that no one entered Jeffrey Epstein's cell before he died by suicide was likely modified before release, Wired claimed after metadata analysis in an explosive revelation. The report came as the Donald Trump administration is trying to fight theories that were supposed to be put to rest with the release of the video.The report said the footage was not directly extracted from the prison's surveillance system but was likely modified using Adobe Premiere Pro but there is no evidence of what was changed and whether the change was meant for any deception.The editing might be just a simple process before releasing it to the public with no modifications other than joining together two clips, the report added, but it triggered room for suspicion as there has been no clear explanation.Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of trafficking, was found hanged in his cell in 2019. There were 150 analog surveillance cameras but starting from July, a technical error prevented almost half of them from recording. The system was scheduled for repairs on August 9, the night before Epstein was found dead. But it was not done as the technician could not access the necessary equipment.As a result, only two cameras were operational, one covering the common area and another covering the 9th floor elevator bay.Epstein's cell was on the 9th floor.The DOJ released the footage showing that no one entered the 9th floor area in front of Epstein's cell between 10.40 pm on August 9, 2019, to 6.30 am the next morning.In the footage released by the administration, there was a one-minute gap from 11.58.58 pm to 12.00.00 am. Attorney General Pam Bondi explained that the gap was because of a technical reason, as the system used to take one minute to reset and to start the next day's recording at 12. The administration explained that this gap is there in every night's recording.","Wired analyzed Epstein raw footage metadata and found it was edited before release.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino has emerged as the 'fall guy' in the Epstein case as he was the one who okayed the release of the surveillance footage from outside Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell. But the footage had a 'missing minute' which has become the albatross around the neck of the administration, as MAGA commentators claimed that the 'cover-up' lies in that missing minute. The administration said that the old surveillance system took one minute to restart and that's why it did not record one minute.Axios cited senior DC officials who said Dan Bongino vouched for the video, as he said he reviewed it and it was okay for release. But when there was a massive meltdown, Bongino ""lost his mind and ran out of DC,"" Axios reported.Axios reported that there was a heated meeting in the White House after the DOJ and FBI memo to close the Epstein case fell flat. Apart from Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the meeting was also attended by FBI director Kash Patel, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich.At the meeting, Pam Bondi said what she had to say, Dan said what he had to say but it didn't end on Friendly terms, the Axios report added.And then, Bongino did not turn up to work Friday, leading to speculations that he is going to take the fall.The report also said that Bondi, Bongino and Patel all have complained to others that they were being unfairly blamed for the Epstein case.Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche put out a statement on X claiming that he worked closely with Kash Patel and Dan Bongino on the joint FBI and DOJ memo regarding the Epstein Files. ""The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo's composition and release is patently false,"" he wrote.A NewsNation article recently reported that a White House source said that Kash Patel would have released Epstein files months ago if he had the authority -- hinting at the DOJ role that stopped him.

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC has thrown out a proposed plea deal for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, effectively halting what was expected to be a major development in one of the most prolonged military prosecutions in US history. In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that then-Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin had acted within his authority when he blocked the agreement last year, a move that prosecutors said was necessary to preserve public confidence in the military tribunal process.The deal, which had taken two years to negotiate and had been approved by military prosecutors and senior Pentagon officials, would have seen Mohammed and two co-defendants plead guilty in exchange for life imprisonment without parole. The agreement also included a commitment from the defendants to answer victims’ families’ lingering questions. But Austin intervened, arguing that such a significant decision—removing the death penalty from consideration—should be made only by the defence secretary.“Having properly assumed the convening authority, the Secretary determined that the ‘families and the American public deserve the opportunity to see military commission trials carried out.’The Secretary acted within the bounds of his legal authority, and we decline to second-guess his judgment,” wrote Judges Patricia Millett and Neomi Rao.In a strong dissent, Judge Robert Wilkins wrote: “The government has not come within a country mile of proving clearly and indisputably that the Military Judge erred.”Mohammed, now 59, appeared in court earlier this week dressed in traditional clothing, his beard dyed bright orange. Asked by the judge if he was pleading guilty to all charges “without exceptions or substitutions,” his lawyer replied, “Yes, we can, Your Honour.” But before the plea could be officially entered, the court was informed that the deal had been paused.Many of the victims’ relatives had flown to Guantanamo Bay to witness the proceedings, only to learn at the last minute that the pleas would not proceed. “It’s like a perpetual limbo… It’s like constant whiplash,” said Elizabeth Miller, whose firefighter father died in the attacks.With the case now back in limbo, any resolution appears unlikely until after the next US administration takes office. Guantanamo Bay, once home to nearly 800 detainees, now holds just 15 men, most of whom have not been convicted.","Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, has had his plea deal thrown out by a federal appeals court.

Epstein fallout: FBI deputy director Dan Bongino skips work Friday. Has he quit after clash with Pam Bondi?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-fallout-fbi-deputy-director-dan-bongino-skips-work-friday-amid-clash-has-he-quit-after-clash-with-pam-bondi/articleshow/122392935.cms,"FBI deputy director Dan Bongino skips work Friday after massive clash with Pam Bondi over Epstein case.

Pam Bondi, Dan Bongino or Kash Patel? Who is to be blamed?



Clash between Bondi and Bongino







FBI deputy director Dan Bongino took a day off from work Friday leading many to believe that he has quit his job after clashing at the White House with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Epstein case that the Donald Trump administration has now officially closed. Axios reported that administration officials insisted that Bongino has not resigned, though internal tension between the FBI and the DOJ continues. The administration also reveleased a surveillance video from outside Epstein's cell to support its claim that no one entered the room.Axios said the dispute started Wednesday after the administration claimed that the convicted sex offender did not have a client list and that he was not murdered in his New York City prison cell in 2019.The 10-hour video, however, has a missing minute which the administration blamed on technicalities. But MAGA world doubled down on that missing minute. The administration said the old surveillance system used to take a minute to reset and record fresh and hence every day, 60 seconds were not recorded.Dan Bongino was blamed internally for oversight after the ""missing minute"" was discovered as it put the administration in a tough spot to defend.And it came from Bongino himself who pushed conspiracy theories before becoming FBI's deputy director and now he gave the go-ahead for the release of the video.""Two sources familiar with Bongino's position say he was increasingly displeased with Bondi's handling of the Epstein case because she had publicly overpromised and underdelivered disclosures about an Epstein ""client list"" that apparently never existed,"" Axios reported.While a section of MAGA influencers want Pam Bondi to be punished for the botch-up, some insiders believe Trump loves Pam Bondi and thinks she's great, thus saving her from any damage.Kash Patel's personal life has been dragged to the controversy as his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins has been called a Mossad agent.The clash between Bondi and Bongino was witnessed by Kash Patel, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich. During the meeting, Bongino was confronted about a NewsNation article that said he and Patel wanted more information released about Epstein earlier, but were held back. Bongino said he did not leak that idea. ""Pam said her piece. Dan said his piece. It didn't end on friendly terms,"" Axios reported, adding that Bongino left the meeting angrily.","FBI deputy director Dan Bongino took a day off from work Friday leading many to believe that he has quit his job after clashing with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Epstein case.

Under-construction girls' school bombed in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/under-construction-girls-school-bombed-in-pakistans-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/122398285.cms,"Representative image





PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

"'Advanced stage of decomposition': Pak actress Humaira Asghar Ali’s body found filled with insects, 'black-coloured mass'; police say remains lay in Karachi flat for 8–10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/advanced-stage-of-decomposition-pak-actress-humaira-asghar-alis-body-found-filled-with-insects-black-coloured-mass-police-say-remains-lay-in-karachi-flat-for-810-months/articleshow/122391960.cms,"



In a disturbing case, Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment, with forensic experts saying she likely died between eight to ten months ago.Her body was discovered last week by a police team executing a court order to vacate the flat.According to Geo News, which cited the initial post-mortem findings, the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition.” Facial muscles had deteriorated, fingers and nails were reduced to bone, and large parts of the body had no muscle tissue left. The bones reportedly began to fall apart when touched.Humaira had acted in several television serials and two films. She lived alone in an apartment in the upscale Defence Housing Society.The report also said that her internal organs had turned into a “black-coloured mass” and brain matter was entirely decomposed due to autolysis. Cartilage in the joints was gone, though no bone fractures were found. While the head and spine remained intact, the spinal cord was missing. Brown-coloured insects were reportedly present, especially in the hair, but no maggots were found.Because of the severe state of decay, experts were unable to determine the exact cause of death at this stage. However, DNA profiling and toxicology tests are underway and are expected to offer further insight.Initially, police said that her family refused to take the body. “Her family members have flatly refused to own her or take the body for burial,” DIG South Zone Asad Reza said, adding they claimed to have severed all ties with her two years ago. He said the case posed unusual challenges, especially since her death had gone unnoticed for such a long time and no neighbours appeared to have raised any concerns.Geo News later confirmed that her family received the remains on Thursday and transported them to Lahore by ambulance.","Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt.

The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.

India's Big Win In Pak Clash? Jaish Chief Masood Azhar's Brother Rauf 'Eliminated' In Op Sindoor





Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.

Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded. India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122305696,imgsize-1142676,width-400,resizemode-4/122305696.jpg"

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world. Scientists warn that climate change is driving a rise in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, putting millions at risk.Rescue operations are ongoing, and authorities have called on the public to remain cautious as the monsoon season continues to intensify.",At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days.

'Free Balochistan': Who is Tommy Robinson? Controversial far-right activist who gained support from Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/free-balochistan-who-is-tommy-robinson-controversial-far-right-activist-who-gained-support-from-elon-musk/articleshow/122293045.cms,"Baloch Leader Declares Independence From Pak, Seeks India's Support On Global Stage

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"
Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.

4.5 magnitude earthquake hits Myanmar; no damage reported- third in one month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/4-5-magnitude-earthquake-hits-myanmar-no-damage-reported-third-in-one-month/articleshow/122378219.cms,"4.5 magnitude earthquake jolts Myanmar (Image credits: ANI)





A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.
