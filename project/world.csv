Sanju then asked his friends Pankaj and Ritik to arrange for a car to go on a long drive.""They all boarded the car and drove towards Rohtak.

Nearly two dozen hotels across Kolkata, Tirupati and Rajkot went into a tizzy on Saturday after emailed bomb threats that eventually turned out to be a hoax, deepening fears that the festival season menace so far aimed at flights and airports was spreading to other key sectors.In Kolkata, at least 10 major hotels — most of them star properties — received the emails on a day home minister Amit Shah was visiting Bengal. Although the usual anti-bomb drills were activated, nothing was found. “The emails followed the same pattern as hoax threats to schools earlier this year,” said a Kolkata cop.Kolkata police alerted central agencies given the multiple threats to flights over the past week. Top officers said the email sender used a pseudonym — Reality Is Fake. “I have planted bombs on the grounds of your hotel. The bombs are hidden in black bags. They will detonate soon. You have little time to live. Evacuate,” one email reportedly stated.In Tirupati, the threat was sent to three hotels Saturday, deepening a pattern as four properties in the Andhra city had been targeted in the past two days. All turned out to be hoaxes.The threat emails referred to Jaffer Sadiq, alleged kingpin of a major drug racket nabbed by central agencies in July. Saturday’s threats mentioned two other names — TN deputy CM Udayanidhi Stalin’s wife Kiruthiga and TN DGP Shankar Jiwal.The email mentioned “Afzal Guru will be re-born! Al-Badr!” — referring to the 2001 Parliament attack convict executed in 2013. The email also claimed Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu’s car was twinned with hotel “IEDs”.In Gujarat’s Rajkot, 10 hotels simultaneously received emails around 12.45pm Saturday from the same ID, “Kan Din”, threatening explosions. Rajkot DCP Parthrajsinh Gohil said the hotels were searched but nothing suspicious was found.","Nearly two dozen hotels across Kolkata, Tirupati and Rajkot went into a tizzy on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday that the recent Line of Actual Control (LAC) pact to tamp down the border tension with China was part of the government's ""very determined effort"" as it stood its ground during the standoff with Beijing.Jaishankar also heaped praises on the military for its role in defending the country and said that military and diplomacy played their part in making thaw with Bejing possible.""...Today we have reached where we have, there are two reasons for it, one- very determined effort on our part to stand our ground and make our point and this would only happen because the military was there in very unimaginable conditions to defend the country and the military did its part and diplomacy did its part,"" Jaishankar said at an event in Pune.The external affairs minister also highlighted the improved infrastructure in the past 10 years as one of the factors that led China to pull back its troops to the position where it was placed prior to the 2020 Galwan clash .""And the second is because actually in the last decade, we have also improved our infrastructure...I think the combination of all of this has led to where it is. When Prime Minister Modi and President Xi met, it was decided that the foreign ministers and the national security advisor will meet and see how to take this forward,"" the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The landmark agreement India and China reached this week to end one of the longest military standoffs in recent times received the final seal of approval on Wednesday from PM Modi andPresident Xi Jinping , as the two held a bilateral meeting in Kazan after a gap of five years and endorsed the deal.This, according to the Indian side, will lead to a further easing of the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). As the next step forward, the two leaders agreed in their 50-minute meeting to soon have the Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the India-China boundary question, which has not taken place since 2019, and underlined the need to take relations forward from a ""strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges"".",Jaishankar heaped praises on the military for its role in defending the country.

Abujmarh’s oldest Maoist with Rs 16 lakh bounty gunned down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abujmarhs-oldest-maoist-with-rs-16-lakh-bounty-gunned-down/articleshow/114637943.cms,"NAGPUR: The most dreaded guerrilla of Dandakaranya forests, Ankalu Dasru Tulavi alias Saoji Tulavi, who had 226 cases against him — the highest in Maharashtra’s criminal history — was neutralised during the dramatic siege of the Maoist headquarters of Abujmarh on Oct 21.The body of the 65-year-old, who carried a bounty of Rs 16 lakh after killing 54 cops and informers and engineering 84 gunbattles with commandos, was identified by surrendered guerrillas after the corpse was flown to Gadchiroli from the encounter site.A key member of the Maoist supply team, Tulavi provided logistics support to People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army ( PLGA ) fighters and other top cadres operating from the once-fortified, booby-trapped Abujmarh hills. He was shot along with another male cadre and three women guerrillas.Tulavi was, perhaps, one of the oldest Maoists, who remained loyal and deeply entrenched in the rebel movement for 33 years, refusing to surrender in face of depleting ranks or state allurements despite his advancing years. He joined the Tippagarh Dalam as a party member in 1991 and rose through the ranks to become a divisional committee member.Tulavi’s criminal case tally overshadowed those of other top Maoists. These included Joganna, who was shot dead in May 2024 and had 195 cases. Slain guerrilla Diwakar Kurchami had 190 cases. Surrendered Maoists Giridhar Tumaretti and Vilas Kolha were booked for 179 and 191 offences, respectively.“A Gadchiroli tribal, Tulavi was an experienced PLGA fighter who knew the region and the terrain like the back of his hand. He also knew routes and strategic locations, which made him pivotal to the rebel army,” said a security agency official. Tulavi, who was moved to the difficult and challenging terrain of Abujmarh, had spurned multiple offers to surrender even as his junior cadres gave up the gun, got married and settled down with police help.While Tulavi cheated death many times, particularly during the 2021 Mardintola encounter in which Maoist central committee member Milind Teltumbde was neutralised, he was unlucky this time. The joint team of C-60 commandos and CRPF teams had surrounded the Koparshi forests in Abujmarh, leaving little room for guerrillas to wriggle out of cordon.The Oct 21 encounter was spearheaded by SP Neelotpal, Addl SPs Yatish Deshmukh and M Ramesh, DIG, Naxal Range, Ankit Goyal, and IG, State Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) chief Sandip Patil.",The body of Ankalu Dasru Tulavi alias Saoji Tulavi was identified by surrendered guerrillas after the corpse was flown to Gadchiroli from the encounter site.

EAM: LAC pact doesn’t mean all issues with China resolved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eam-lac-pact-doesnt-mean-all-issues-with-china-resolved/articleshow/114636909.cms,"PUNE: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the breakthrough agreement with China on patrolling along the LAC does not mean that issues between the two countries have been resolved, however, the disengagement allows us to look at the next step.He credited the military, which worked in ""very very unimaginable"" conditions, and deft diplomacy for the breakthrough agreement with China. ""The latest step (of disengagement) was the October 21 understanding that patrolling will take place in Depsang and Demchok. This will allow us now to look at the next step. It is not like everything has been resolved but the disengagement which is the first phase we have managed to reach that level,"" Jaishankar said at an event in Pune.Responding to a question during a separate interaction with students, Jaishankar said it is still a bit early for normalisation of relations which will naturally take time to rebuild a degree of trust and willingness to work together.He said when PM Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping at Kazan in Russia for Bricsthe BRICS summit, it was decided that the foreign ministers and National Security Advisors of the two countries would meet and see how to move forward.""If today we have reached where we have...One is because of the very determined effort on our part to stand our ground and make our point. The military was there (at LAC) in very very unimaginable conditions to defend the country, and the military did its part and diplomacy did its part,"" Jaishankar said. Over the decade, India improved its infrastructure, he said, adding that part of the problem is that in the earlier years, the border infrastructure was really neglected.""Today we have put in five times more resources annually than there used to be a decade ago which is showing results and enabling the military to actually be effectively deployed. The combination of these (factors) has led to where it is,"" he said.Earlier this week, India announced it had reached an agreement with China on patrolling along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a major breakthrough in ending the over four-year-long military standoff .Following the agreement, the two countries have begun troop disengagement at the two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh and this process is likely to be completed by October 28-29.","Jaishankar said it is still a bit early for normalisation of relations which will naturally take time to rebuild a degree of trust and willingness to work together.

Good, bad or indifferent. I do a lot of shows and they come out good.""Trump appeared on the shows of several podcasters like Adin Ross, the Lex Friedman Podcast, Six Feed Under, This Past Weekend etc.Trump's appearance at the Rogan show will have its moment as not long before Joe Rogan supported RFK Jr's candidacy over Trump before Kennedy Jr opted out of the race and endorsed Donald Trump. Trump did not take Rogan's support to Kennedy Jr lightly and said he was looking forward to Rogan getting booed at a UFC tournament.Rogan also praised Kamala Harris' debate performance and said whoever helped coached her had done a ""fucking amazing job"". “See, the difference in that debate was not a difference in, like, who’s gonna have better policies? Who’s gonna be better for the country?” Rogan told comedian Tom Segura at the time. “The … debate, in my opinion, was who was better prepared. She was way better prepared.”In 2022, Rogan said he did not want to help Trump electorally because he was ""an existential threat to democracy"".A New Jersey native, Rogan began his career as a stand-up comedian in the Boston area before relocating to California in the 1990s. He was one of the first comics to venture into podcasting in 2-009.","Donald Trump will record his interview with Joe Rogan today at Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas.

ALMATY: Uzbekistan votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday that is certain, in the absence of opposition parties, to produce a legislature loyal to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev despite some changes to the procedure after a constitutional reform .Mirziyoyev has run Central Asia's most populous nation, since 2016, winning broad popularity through liberal economic reforms and an easing of his predecessor's draconian restrictions on political, religious and media freedoms.However, political power in the nation of 37 million remains concentrated in Mirziyoyev's hands, and parliament routinely rubber-stamps laws drafted by his cabinet.The main change introduced under the 2023 constitutional reform is a switch to a mixed election system, in which only half of the 150 deputies are elected by voting for political parties .The other 75 candidates will be elected individually, although all of them have also been nominated by Uzbekistan's five registered parties, none of which oppose Mirziyoyev.One area where Uzbek parliament deputies have been more outspoken than government officials is over the former Soviet republic's relations with Russia.For example, when Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed concern about an incident in an Uzbek school last month where a teacher hit a student who spoke Russian instead of Uzbek, Alisher Qodirov, who leads theMilliy Tiklanish (National Revival) party, told Moscow to mind its own business.Uzbekistan has close economic ties with Russia and millions of Uzbek migrant labourers work there to provide for their families at home.But Tashkent has remained neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has said it abides by Western sanctions against Moscow.",Shavkat Mirziyoyev has run Central Asia's most populous nation since 2016.

Trump or Harris: Who is Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu likely to support?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-or-harris-who-is-israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-likely-to-support/articleshow/114644543.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is hopeful for Trump’s return to the presidency, expecting beneficial policies for Israel despite Trump's mixed messages. Analysts suggest a Trump victory would provide Netanyahu greater freedom, contrasting Biden's more critical stance. Meanwhile, Palestinians remain skeptical of both candidates.

Historic partnership

Popularity contest

Mixed feelings among Palestinians

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely counting on a return for former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump to the White House, AFP reported citing political analysts.The former president's previous tenure was marked by a series of favorable policies for Israel , and Trump’s mixed messages on Middle Eastern policy have put Netanyahu in a position of hopeful anticipation.In recent remarks, Trump has oscillated between urging aggressive military action—such as striking Iran’s nuclear facilities—and criticizing Netanyahu for the October 7 attack, claiming it would not have occurred under his administration. He also suggested he would pressure Israel to de-escalate its ongoing conflicts. Despite these mixed signals, political analysts assert that Netanyahu views a Trump presidency as a potential boon.Gidon Rahat, a political science professor at Hebrew University, told AFP, ""One of Netanyahu's milestones is the US election . He is praying for a Trump victory, which he thinks will give him a lot of freedom of movement.""This sentiment was shared by Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, who noted, ""His experience with Republicans is very good... unlike with the Democrats who are much tougher on him.""Netanyahu’s relationship with Trump stands out over his 17 years in office, having only worked alongside one Republican president. Trump’s administration initiated several actions that bolstered Netanyahu’s political capital, such as relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and facilitating the normalization of relations between Israel and three Arab nations. Trump’s withdrawal from theIran nuclear deal and the imposition of severe sanctions against the Islamic Republic further solidified his status as a staunch ally of Israel.In stark contrast, President Joe Biden's approach has been characterized by a more restrained engagement, often critical of Netanyahu’s policies, especially regarding strikes on Iran's oil and nuclear infrastructure. Yet, despite this frigid relationship, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his ""ironclad support"" for Israel.The former president's popularity in Israel is notable. A recent poll by Mitvim, the Israel Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, indicated that 68% of Israelis believe Trump would best serve their nation's interests, compared to just 14% for Vice President Kamala Harris, despite her vocal support for Israel.While Netanyahu may relish the prospect of Trump’s return, Palestinians remain largely dissatisfied with both candidates. Voices on the ground express skepticism about any potential change stemming from the US elections as both candidates are seen as pro-Israel.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely counting on a return for former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump to the White House.

Amid conjecture that big-tech CEOs and billionaires are folding before his hints of retribution after seeing the ""writing on the wall"" in the Presidential elections, MAGA supremo Donald Trump is claiming that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to compliment him on his visit to McDonald's .""I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google,"" Trump claimed at a rally in Pennsylvania, repeating an assertion he made a few hours before on the Joe Rogan podcast.Trump has previously claimed such supplicatory calls from Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook/META's Mark Zuckerberg. As with Pichai, they too have refrained from confirming or denying the calls, likely so as to not offend the tetchy former President.Claiming calls and conversations from prominent figures, including foreign leaders, has long been a Trump practice. Some critics see them as fictional or hyperbolic or an inaccurate or self-aggrandizing rendering of the exchanges.Trump frequently relates how he warned France's President Emmanuel Macron that would impose retaliatory tariffs on French wines and champagne if France did the same to American automobile industry, forcing him to back down. He also claims to have warned a Taliban leader, whom he refers to only by the first name ""Abdul,"" that he would bomb his house if US troops in Afghanistan are attacked.He once claimed, in a White House meeting with then Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him to mediate on the Kashmir issue, forcing New Delhi to refute the claim. Such an invitation would be a departure from New Delhi's long-standing position that it is a bilateral matter, a stand successive US administrations have embraced.Typically, foreign leaders and business honchos who Trump claims made conciliatory calls, do not confirm the conversation -- likely so as to not offend him. But Trump's MAGA acolytes see these uncontested claims as proof of Trump's impending victory.""They’re either all trying to keep up with Elon Musk or they’re trying to get ahead of something they see coming,"" Charlie Kirk, a prominent Trump supporter and MAGA talking head, said. Another Trump supporter noted that ""when Fortune 500 CEOs start aligning towards the end of the election cycle, that should give everyone some indication of what's coming..these people have more skin in the game and know better to align early.""",Donald Trump claims Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to compliment him on his visit to McDonald's.

Tropical storm Trami has caused severe flooding and landslides in Philippines , leaving at least 126 people dead or missing, according to the government’s disaster-response agency . President Ferdinand Marcos said on Saturday that many areas remain isolated, and people are in urgent need of rescue.Trami, also known as Kristine, exited the northwestern Philippines on Friday, resulting in at least 85 deaths and 41 missing persons, making it one of the deadliest storms of the year in the region, according to the government agency. The death toll is expected to rise as more reports emerge from previously inaccessible areas.Emergency personnel, including police and firefighters, are using backhoes and sniffer dogs to continue search and rescue efforts in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province. In the town center, more than a dozen coffins bearing the remains of storm victims were lined up. These victims were discovered amidst mud, boulders, and trees from landslides.President Marcos inspected another severely affected region southeast of Manila, highlighting the overwhelming impact of the rainfall. “The water was just too much,” he said. “We’re not done yet with our rescue work. Many areas remain flooded and inaccessible, even by large vehicles.”Marcos stressed the need for a major flood control project to address future climate threats . Over 5 million people were affected by the storm, with nearly half a million displaced to emergency shelters.In an emergency Cabinet meeting, officials raised concerns about the possibility of the storm making a U-turn due to high-pressure winds in the South China Sea . If its course remains unchanged, the storm is expected to reach Vietnam over the weekend.To ensure public safety, the Philippine government closed schools and offices on Friday, and suspended inter-island ferry services, stranding thousands. As weather conditions cleared on Saturday, cleanup operations began in many areas.The Philippines, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea, experiences around 20 storms and typhoons annually. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan left over 7,300 people dead or missing and devastated entire communities.","Tropical storm Trami has caused severe flooding and landslides in Philippines, leaving at least 126 people dead or missing.

What McDonald's said

A photo of a young Kamala Harris donning a blue dress apparently of McDonald's when she did a stint there has gone viral. But MAGA supporters pointed out that it was a doctored image shared mostly by pro-Kamala Harris accounts on X. They shared the original image of a McDonald's staff which they claimed had been manipulated to put Kamala Harris' face.Working at McDonald's emerged as a key flashpoint between the GOP and the Democrats as Donald Trump claimed Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald's 41 years ago. To emulate her 'false claim', Donald Trump last Sunday worked a shift at a McDonald's outlet in Pennsylvania and said he worked 15 minutes more than Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris never worked at any McDonald's -- as there is no record of it.“We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote after his McDonald's shift. “In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this ‘job’ for years.”Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983. But the Trump campaign claimed that there has been no record of Kamala Harris working at McDonald's she claimed and hence she lied. But reports said it was a pre-digital era and no record found may not hint at 'never worked'.McDonald's said it is true that no records of Harris' employment exist but this is not an aberration and not a reason to think that she didn't work at a McDonald's. ""Though we are not a political brand, we’ve been proud to hear former President Trump’s love for McDonald’s and Vice President Harris’s fond memories working under the Arches. While we and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ’80s, what makes ‘1 in 8’ so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had.""",Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

As the race for the US presidency intensifies with less than two weeks until the election, members of the Arab and Muslim community in Michigan endorsed Donald Trump during a rally in Detroit.Speaking from the stage, a community leader highlighted the reasons for their backing: “As the President said, we just had a positive meeting with President Trump. We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace. He promises peace , not war.” This endorsement aligns with Trump’s recent claims that, if elected, he would work to end conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, areas plagued by long-standing turmoil.The leader continued, saying, “The bloodshed has to stop all over the world and I think this man can make that happen.”The endorsement also touched on family values, with the leader saying, “We support Donald J. Trump for his commitment to promoting family values and protecting our children’s well-being, especially when it comes to curriculums and schools.” This focus on educational reform resonates with many voters who prioritise the welfare of their families in their electoral choices.In a time when immigration remains a contentious topic, the community expressed agreement with Trump’s stance on border security. “We want a strong border… but anyone who wants to come to this country is welcome through a legal pathway,” the leader noted.The rally also featured light-hearted predictions, with the speaker humorously forecasting the Detroit Lions’ victory in the Super Bowl alongside Trump’s potential election as the 47th president of the United States. “We are with President Trump to make America great again through peace and justice for all,” they concluded, invoking a vision of unity.This endorsement comes amidst a backdrop of fierce campaigning, with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris exchanging sharp critiques. Trump has warned that Harris’s presidency could lead the US into World War III, a claim she vehemently contests. Meanwhile, former First Lady Michelle Obama has been rallying support for Harris, condemning Trump’s previous tenure and urging voters to reconsider their choices.","Members of the Arab and Muslim community in Michigan endorsed Donald Trump during a rally in Detroit.

To assist commuters traveling from Teen Hatti, the police offered an alternative route through PIB Colony.The factions of the Battagram Trade Union have announced a complete shutter-down strike and sit-in beginning Tuesday in response to the widespread power outage in Karachi district, Pakistan.

This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous."" They argue that the daytime power outages are solely to ensure a continuous electricity supply at night for the ongoing operation of CCTV cameras in the sub-jail.The union further contended that the decision to cut power constitutes an ""economic murder"" of local traders, who have been unable to conduct business for over a week. Consequently, the union is urging immediate action to restore power supply in the area, aiming to safeguard the economic interests of both residents and business operators.","Residents of Karachi have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.
