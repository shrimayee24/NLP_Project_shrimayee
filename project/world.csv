Pahalgam attack 'economic warfare'

Jaishankar debunks Trump's trade 'warning'

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday again reiterated in no uncertain terms that India would not yield to nuclear blackmail and that New Delhi was ""not going to fall for"" the world worrying about the consequences of attacking nuclear-armed Pakistan.Jaishankar said terrorists would be dealt with ""no impunity"" and even the government that backs such terror outfits won't be spared.""We are very clear there will be no impunity for terrorists, that we will not deal with them any longer as proxies and spare the government which supports and finances and in many ways, motivates them. We will not allow nuclear blackmail to prevent us from responding,” Jaishankar said during an interview with Newsweek hosted at the publication’s headquarters at One World Trade Centre near the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan.The external affairs minister said, “we've also heard this for too long” that both India and Pakistan are nuclear countries and “therefore the other guy will come and do horrible things, but you mustn't do anything because it gets the world worried"".“Now we are not going to fall for that. If he is going to come and do things, we are going to go there and also hit the people who did this. So no yielding to nuclear blackmail, no impunity to terrorists, no more free pass that they are proxies.And we will do what we have to do to defend our people,” Jaishankar said amid applause from the audience.Jaishankar described the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam as an act of “economic warfare” intended to destroy tourism in Kashmir.Referring to a long pattern of cross-border attacks, Jaishankar said there was a sentiment in the country that “enough is enough”.He pointed out that the Pakistan-based terrorists targeting India do not operate in secrecy, and likened their infrastructure to corporate entities housed openly in urban areas.“These are terrorist organisations who have the ‘equivalent of their corporate headquarters in the populated towns of Pakistan,’” he said.“Everybody knows what is the headquarters of organisation A and organisation B and those are the buildings, the headquarters that India destroyed,” he added.India launched Operation Sindoor in retaliation for the Pahalgam massacre, striking at terror infrastructure inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), had claimed responsibility for the attack. In the operation, the forces hit hotbeds of terror in Pakistan's Bahawalpur and Muridke.During a Q&A session after the discussion, Jaishankar was asked whether President Donald Trump's claim of using trade to halt the recent India-Pakistan conflict had impacted ongoing trade negotiations between New Delhi and Washington.“No, I don't think so. I think the trade people are doing what the trade people should be doing, which is negotiate with numbers and lines and products and do their trade-offs. I think they are very professional and very, very focused about it,” Jaishankar said.He said that there is a national consensus in India that “our dealings with Pakistan are bilateral.“And in this particular case, I can tell you that I was in the room when Vice President (JD) Vance spoke to Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi on the night of May 9, saying that the Pakistanis would launch a very massive assault on India if we did not accept certain things.“And the Prime Minister was impervious to what the Pakistanis were threatening to do. On the contrary, he indicated that there would be a response from us. This was the night before and the Pakistanis did attack us massively that night, we responded very quickly thereafter,"" Jaishankar said.""And the next morning, Mr (Secretary of State Marco) Rubio called me up and said the Pakistanis were ready to talk. So I can only tell you from my personal experience what happened. The rest I leave to you,"" he said.","Jaishankar said terrorists would be dealt with ""no impunity"" and even the government that backs such terror outfits won't be spared. The external affairs minister said, “we've also heard this for too long” that both India and Pakistan are nuclear countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122172930,imgsize-32366,width-400,resizemode-4/122172930.jpg"

Enemies may exist across borders but there should be none within the country.

A 24-year-old Indian woman has gone missing just days after she arrived in the United States for an arranged marriage, authorities in New Jersey said this week.The woman, identified as Simran, landed in the US on June 20. She reportedly arrived in the country for an arranged marriage. However, investigators say there’s a possibility she never intended to follow through with the marriage and may have used the opportunity as a way to travel to the US.Surveillance footage obtained by Lindenwold Police shows her standing alone, looking at her phone and appearing to wait for someone. Officials noted that she did not seem distressed in the video, New York Post reported.Simran was last seen wearing gray sweatpants, a white T-shirt, black flip flops, and small diamond-studded earrings. She stands about 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighs approximately 150 pounds, and has a small scar on the left side of her forehead.Simran has no known relatives in the United States and does not speak English. Her phone is an international device that only functions via Wi-Fi, further complicating efforts to contact her.Police said they have also been unable to get in touch with her family in India.Authorities are urging anyone with information about Simran’s whereabouts to contact Lindenwold Police Detective Joe Tomasetti.","The woman, identified as Simran, landed in the US on June 20.

Forgery and manipulation of land records Lack of timely response from authorities

FEROZEPUR: There’s crookery. Then there’s crookery with ambition. What would have been a flight of fancy for most practionists of this art was clandestinely turned into reality by a mother-son duo in Punjab’s Ferozepur sometime in 1997.A World War-II era airstrip, used by Indian Air Force during the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars as an advanced landing ground, was allegedly sold off by a mother and son in 1997 in connivance with some revenue officials. Now, 28 years later, accused Usha Ansal and her son Naveen Chand have been named in an FIR.The Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered Punjab Vigilance Bureau (VB) chief director to probe the allegation, and the report, filed on June 20, has led to the FIR. The case has been registered under IPC Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), and 120B (criminal conspiracy). DSP Karan Sharma is heading the investigation to identify all those involved in this long-concealed scam involving strategic defence land.The airstrip is in Fattuwala village, very close to Pakistan border. It was only in May 2025, after HC intervention, that the land was finally restored to ministry of defence.The VB inquiry confirmed that the land belongs to IAF. Acquired on March 12, 1945 by the British administration for use in World War II, it has remained in IAF possession and was used in three wars. According to the probe, accused Usha and Naveen, of Dumni Wala village, deceitfully claimed ownership of the land and sold it off in collusion with a section of revenue officials after forging revenue records.The original complaint was filed by whistleblower Nishan Singh, a retired revenue official, but nothing happened for years. In 2021, the commandant of Halwara Air Force Station wrote to Ferozepur deputy commissioner demanding a probe. Still nothing happened.Nishan filed a petition in HC seeking an inquiry. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the original owner of the land, Madan Mohal Lal, died in 1991. However, the sale deeds were executed in 1997 and the names of Surjit Kaur, Manjit Kaur, Mukhtiar Singh, Jagir Singh, Dara Singh, Ramesh Kant, and Rakesh Kant were shown as owners in the Jamabandi from 2009-10, although the military had never transferred the land to them.HC reprimanded Ferozepur deputy commissioner for inaction, pointing out the potential threat to national security. In his order, Justice Harjit Singh Brar asked Punjab VB chief director to personally verify the veracity of the allegations and, if required, take action. He was asked to conclude the probe within four weeks.","Usha Ansal and her son Naveen Chand have been named in an FIR.

Everyone knows who put in the struggle, sweat, effort and interest to achieve this victory.

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning—Travis Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

How many citizens are at risk?







The Donald Trump administration has formalized its efforts to speed up the revocation of US citizenship for some Americans, putting naturalized citizens, immigrants who became Americans through the legal naturalization process, in the crosshairs.A justice department memo, issued on June 11, directs government attorneys to prioritize civil proceedings that strip citizenship from individuals who allegedly obtained it illegally or by lying during the process or are charged with crimes.The directive focuses on using civil proceedings to revoke citizenship in cases involving war crimes, extrajudicial killings, human rights abuses, terrorism, and individuals convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the US.""The benefits of civil denaturalization include the government’s ability to revoke the citizenship of individuals who engaged in the commission of war crimes, extrajudicial killings, or other serious human rights abuses; to remove naturalized criminals, gang members, or, indeed, any individuals convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the United States; and to prevent convicted terrorists from returning to U.S.soil or traveling internationally on a US passport,"" it said.""The Civil Division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,"" it added.At the heart of this move are roughly 25 million US citizens who were born abroad but became Americans through naturalization, according to 2023 data.The memo outlines 10 priority categories for denaturalization, including individuals involved in war crimes, human rights abuses, gang activity, or those convicted of crimes deemed to pose an ongoing threat to the US.At least one individual has already been stripped of US citizenship in recent weeks after a conviction. According to the DOJ, the person had been found guilty of collecting and distributing child sexual abuse material, Axios reported.","The Justice Department has issued a memo to speed up the revocation of US citizenship for some Americans.

A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national accused of human smuggling, amid fears from his legal team that US immigration authorities could deport him before he stands trial.US magistrate judge Barbara Holmes had ruled on June 22 that Abrego Garcia was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and approved his release on conditions—including that he live with his US citizen brother in Maryland. However, she paused the release after defence attorneys raised alarm over conflicting statements from the Trump administration regarding his immigration status.In court filings, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said they had “no faith” in government assurances that he would not be deported, citing contradictions. Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin told the Associated Press that Abrego Garcia would be tried before any deportation. But just hours earlier, another DOJ lawyer, Jonathan Guynn, told a Maryland judge the government planned to deport him to a “third country,” not El Salvador, with no clear timeline. A DHS spokesperson later declared that Abrego Garcia “will never go free on American soil.”Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint in the immigration debate earlier this year when he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a 2019 court order protecting him from removal due to threats from gangs.Under mounting legal pressure, the administration returned him to the US in June. He pleaded not guilty on June 13 to smuggling charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, where he was found transporting nine passengers without luggage.His attorneys have called the charges “preposterous,” accusing the government of using the case to try him in the “court of public opinion” while seeking to deport him before trial. Acting US Attorney Rob McGuire told the court that he had no authority over ICE, raising further concerns about enforcement during legal proceedings.A new hearing is scheduled for July 16, where the court will decide whether prosecutors can revoke the earlier release order. Until then, Abrego Garcia remains in federal custody in Nashville.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, is accused of human smuggling.

The two were accompanied by a small group of aides and friends and reportedly visited the restaurant for lunch on Wednesday.In a video clip shared by Lovin Dubai on Instagram, a woman, described her unforgettable experience:“He paid the entire bill,” she said, estimating the total cost to be between AED 25,000 and AED 30,000 (approximately $6,800 to $8,200 USD).Lovin Dubai captioned the video:“Covers the bill for everyone dining at a restaurant in Dubai! That’s our Crown Prince.”Videos shared online captured the leaders walking into the restaurant and greeting diners with a traditional Islamic salutation, wishing them peace, a gesture that set the tone for what would become an unforgettable experience for everyone present.Among the diners was Emirati national Noura Mohammed AlMarzooqi, who spoke to local news outlet Khaleej Times about the extraordinary moment. “They were super friendly and said hello to everyone and made the experience really great for us,” she recalled. When she asked for the cheque after her meal, she was informed that Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed had paid for everyone dining at the restaurant. “Only in UAE will you see the royal families spending lovely time with their people and spreading kindness and making the experience priceless,” she said, capturing the sentiment many others would go on to express online.Social media quickly lit up with admiration for Sheikh Hamdan’s generosity. Users praised the Crown Prince as “a great person with a golden heart” and “someone who always does something amazing.” One commenter noted, “It happens all the time. Happened to me once,” suggesting that such gracious gestures are not entirely uncommon in the UAE. Another shared a personal dream: “When I moved to Dubai four years ago, my goal was to meet him so I could ask him to be my business partner. Still waiting.”These reactions reflect the deep respect and affection that many in the UAE feel for Sheikh Hamdan, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Known for his adventurous lifestyle and approachable nature, Fazza remains a beloved figure among both citizens and expatriates, someone whose actions continue to inspire admiration and foster connection across the community.Following the viral attention, La Maison Ani issued an official statement to Khaleej Times, calling the visit from the two Crown Princes both an honour and a privilege:“It was an absolute honor and privilege for our team to welcome Their Highnesses to La Maison Ani. The experience was seamless, and we are truly grateful for the opportunity to serve them. Moments like these are a proud reminder of the trust placed in us to deliver excellence at every level.”The restaurant also described the Crown Princes’ demeanour:“The Crown Princes maintained a warm and respectful presence throughout their visit. While the occasion was private, their gracious demeanour and generosity left a lasting impression. Both our team and surrounding guests deeply appreciated the atmosphere their presence brought. The visit took place during lunch in a calm and elegant setting.

Wess Roley's tumultuous childhood







20-year-old Wess Roley who lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire, had a disturbing childhood, CNN reported, citing court documents. As soon as the shooter was identified as Wess Roley, social media was abuzz with a purported photo of his parents (mother and stepfather) sporting MAGA hats. While the veracity of most of the social media claims are not known, Wess Roley's grandfather spoke to CNN and said he was not a loner and had no reason to be involved in something like this.Wess Roley who was found dead at the fire scene himself wanted to be a firefighter, his grandfather said. “He wanted to be a fireman – he was doing tree work and he wanted to be a fireman in the forest,” Dale Roley said. “As far as I know, he was actually pursuing it.”Dale Roley said he typically spoke with his grandson on a weekly basis, but they hadn’t spoken in the last month because Wess Roley had lost his phone. He said the suspect had loving family and friends, and he vacationed in Hawaii with his mother last year, according to social media posts.He said he was holding out hope that his grandson was not the actual shooter.CNN cited court documents claiming that Roley's mother filed for divorce in 2015 when Roley was 10 years old. In court documents, she wrote that Roley's father threatened her, pushed her to the ground and ""pinched several holes in the walls"".“He threatened to sit outside my house with a sniper rifle or burn my house down,” she wrote.The divorce was granted in two months and Roley's mother became the primary residential parent. His father was initially prevented from having contact with his wife or son but the order was later amended.Roley's father told CNN that he was not close with his son and hadn't seen him since a family gathering last year.","20-year-old Wess Roley lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire.

Authorities in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa are investigating the deaths of 20 men whose bodies were found with gunshot wounds near a highway bridge outside Culiacán, the state capital. At least five of the victims had been decapitated, officials said.Local media reported that a hand‑lettered message, apparently from one of the warring factions of the Sinaloa cartel, was strung across the bridge. Investigators confirmed the note’s existence but declined to reveal its contents, saying only that it formed part of the inquiry, reported CNN.Calling the massacre “a regrettable situation” and “part of the violence and insecurity Sinaloa is experiencing,” state Secretary‑General Feliciano Castro Meléndez said police and soldiers had been deployed to secure the area and hunt the killers.Culiacán has been the epicentre of a bitter turf war since 2024 between, a group loyal to alleged cartel co‑founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, and, the faction led by the sons of jailed drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.Security analysts trace the latest flare‑up to the dramatic 2024 US arrests of Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López, one of El Chapo’s sons, a sting that deepened distrust between the rival camps.Media sources have put Monday’s decapitation toll at five, the state prosecutor’s office later told Reuters that at least six victims had been beheaded, highlighting the fluid nature of the probe.Local tallies suggest nearly 3,000 people reported dead or missing since the conflict erupted, according to local tallies.Authorities say additional army units will remain in Culiacán “until peace is restored”, but residents complain the rival groups continue to patrol neighbourhoods openly, underscoring the state’s limited reach.","Bodies found with gunshot wounds near a highway bridge outside Culiacan.

On Monday, he indicated his readiness to establish a new ""America Party"" should the GOP legislation succeed.""If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,"" he posted on X to his 220 million followers. ""Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.""By evening, Musk offered concrete support for Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a notable opponent of Trump's bill.

He also engaged in disagreement with Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.He expressed renewed interest in establishing a new political party whilst criticising legislators from both parties, labelling them as members of the ""porky pig party"" due to government expenditure levels.Musk's association with the Republican Party has been brief and uncertain.

An 82-year-old woman injured in a firebomb attack on a peaceful gathering in support of Israeli hostages has died from her injuries, prompting prosecutors to add a first-degree murder charge against the suspect, officials said.Karen Diamond was among a group of around 20 people participating in a “Run for Their Lives” event on June 1 at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder when a man threw multiple Molotov cocktails at the crowd. The attack left 12 people injured, including Diamond, who sustained critical burns. The Boulder County District Attorney’s Office confirmed her death on Monday.""This horrific attack has now claimed the life of an innocent person who was beloved by her family and friends,"" District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a statement. ""Our hearts are with the Diamond family during this incredibly difficult time.""The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of Colorado Springs, was arrested shortly after the attack. According to court documents, Soliman shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he hurled homemade firebombs at the group. He later told police he intended to ""kill all Zionist people.""Federal authorities have labeled the incident a terrorist attack.Soliman was indicted last week on 12 federal hate crime counts and faces over 100 state charges, including attempted murder and arson. With Diamond's death, prosecutors are now adding a charge of first-degree murder.Investigators say Soliman, an Egyptian national living illegally in the US, had been planning the attack for a year. He allegedly studied how to make Molotov cocktails online and traveled from Colorado Springs to Boulder dressed in a construction vest, posing as a gardener to approach the group without raising suspicion.At the scene, authorities recovered 16 additional unlit Molotov cocktails in a plastic container and a weed sprayer filled with petrol. Officials believe these were intended for use had Soliman not been stopped.Soliman’s attorney, David Kraut, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf in court last week. Soliman remains in custody as the legal proceedings continue. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have taken his wife and five children into custody. A federal judge has temporarily blocked their deportation.The attack and now Diamond’s death have shaken the Boulder community. Vigils have been held in her memory, and tributes have poured in from those who knew her as a dedicated community member and a passionate advocate.Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack and expressed condolences to the Diamond family, calling her death “a tragic loss born of senseless hate.”The next court hearing in the case is scheduled for July 15.","Karen Diamond, 82, was injured in a firebomb attack on a peaceful gathering in support of Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado.

"'Not a loner, wanted to be...': Grandfather of Idaho shooter Wess Roley says he had no reason to attack firefighters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-a-loner-wanted-to-be-grandfather-of-idaho-shooter-wess-roley-says-he-had-no-reason-to-attack-firefighters/articleshow/122168314.cms,"Idaho shooter Wess Roley's grandfather spoke about his childhood, family and friends.





20-year-old Wess Roley who started a brush fire deliberately and then shot at firefighters when they responded to the fire in a shockingly bizarre incident in Idaho Sunday had no reason to do that, his grandfather, Dale Roley, told CNN. Wess Roley was found dead at the site of the fire hours after he created the senseless tragedy.Though Wess Roley had a tumultuous childhood with his parents divorcing when he was 10 years old, his grandfather said he had loving family and friends. He went to vacation in Hawaii with his mother last year. Dale Roley told CNN that his grandson came from a family of arborists and had been working in the tree service industry while trying to figure out his career path.“He wanted to be a fireman – he was doing tree work and he wanted to be a fireman in the forest,” Dale Roley said. “As far as I know, he was actually pursuing it.”His grandfather confirmed that the 20-year-old owned a shotgun and a long rifle. It's not known whether the sniper ambush was carried out with these firearms.“It wasn’t like he was a loner,” Dale Roley told CNN. “We had no reason to suspect that he would be involved in something like this.”He said he was holding out hope that his grandson wasn’t actually the shooter.CNN reported that Wess Roley had previously lived in the Phoenix area. A running website said that he ran track at a high school in the area and was a member of the school’s class of 2024.Idaho Gov. Brad Little has ordered that flags in the state fly at half-staff to honor the firefighters killed in the ambush on Sunday.A major political tussle is going on X over Roley's MAGA link as his step parents were seen sporting MAGA hats but his Roley's political leanings are not known. MAGA supporters dismissed the claims and said MAGA supporters never attack first responders.","20-year-old Wess Roley started a brush fire deliberately and then shot at firefighters when they responded to the fire in a shockingly bizarre incident in Idaho Sunday.

"Flash floods sweep Pakistan’s Swat Valley, kill 32",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/flash-floods-sweep-pakistans-swat-valley-kill-32/articleshow/122146687.cms,"



MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing ever really changes,” said Khan Sher, a resident of Mingora, recalling Taliban control before the 2009 army offensive and the devastation of the 2010 floods.Heavy rain pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan, causing widespread destruction. “Flash floods caught us off-guard in Swat.We’ve retrieved 16 bodies so far from the river. Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.
