Suvendu Adhikari slams West Bengal CM:

.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “politicising” the recent floods and landslides in North Bengal, calling his remarks a political low.She said the crisis was not a time for partisan chest-thumping and urged all parties to prioritise relief and recovery efforts over political disputes.In a post on X, she wrote: ""Yes, we all condemn violence, unequivocally. But this is not the time for partisan chest-thumping. This is a time to help and heal.""She called PM Modi’s remarks “unfortunate and deeply concerning” and reminded him that he is the Prime Minister of India, not just of the BJP . His responsibility lies in nation-building, not narrative-building.Banerjee further accused the prime minister of blaming the TMC and the West Bengal government without verified evidence or proper investigation.She wrote: “It is unfortunate and deeply concerning that the Prime Minister of India has chosen to politicise a natural disaster without waiting for a proper investigation, especially while people in North Bengal are grappling with the aftermath of devastating floods and landslides.”This comes after BJP MLA Shankar Ghosh and Malda North MP Khagen Murmu were allegedly attacked while distributing relief materials in Nagrakata, North Bengal.PM Modi’s remarks came in response to the incident, criticising the TMC and the West Bengal government for the law and order situation in the state.Banerjee highlighted that while the state administration and police were fully engaged in relief and rescue operations, BJP leaders visited the affected areas with a large convoy of cars and central security forces without informing local authorities.She questioned, ""How can the state administration, local police, or the TMC be blamed for the incident?""She slammed the recent visit of PM Modi to Manipur in September, observing that he visited the ethnic violence-hit state 964 days after the crisis.The West Bengal CM accused him of engaging in “opportunistic political theatre” and criticised him for making sweeping claims without verified evidence.She added, ""The PM has blamed the TMC and the West Bengal Government outright without a shred of verified evidence, legal inquiry, or administrative report. This is not just a political low, it is a breach of the constitutional ethos the Prime Minister has sworn to uphold.""She observed that the incident occurred in a constituency represented by a BJP MLA, yet the Prime Minister attributed it to the TMC, calling such sweeping and unsubstantiated generalisations immature and unbecoming of the highest office.Banerjee also accused the BJP of trying to polarise the state along North Bengal and South Bengal lines, stressing that while violence must be condemned, the focus should remain on relief and healing.She urged unity, calling on all parties to work together to serve the people in need and leave politics aside during the crisis.As floodwaters began receding in North Bengal on Monday, eight more bodies were recovered, raising the death toll in one of the region’s worst calamities to 36.Many people remain missing. Until Sunday, 28 bodies had been recovered across the hills and plains of North Bengal, including five Nepalis.West Bengal CM who arrived in the region on Monday had announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of each deceased.West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari hit out at Banerjee after her post.In a post on X, Adhikari wrote, “You are nothing but a ‘Dictator in Denial’. Resign if you have any shame left.”He accused her of attempting to whitewash her party workers’ misconduct and criticised her for failing to act while North Bengal was affected by floods.Adhikari added that BJP leaders stepped in to help victims and said the Prime Minister’s remarks on the issue were accurate, observing that such violence was unexpected during a time of crisis.",West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “politicising” the recent floods and landslides in North Bengal.

Not being allowed to meet Wangchuk, wife tells Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to Centre and Ladakh UT on a petition filed by Sonam Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali J Angmo, challenging his detention under the stringent National Security Act, but refused to pass interim order to the authorities to give her the grounds of arrest after it was alleged they had been “served on the detenue (Wangchuk)”.Posting hearing on October 14, SC asked why she too shouldn’t be given grounds of arrest.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria that he would examine the feasibility of providing grounds of detention to Sonam Wangchuk’s family.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Angmo, contended that she was not being allowed to meet him. SC asked her to approach the authority concerned and allowed her to move court if denied. Sibal argued that detention could not be challenged if the grounds of arrest were not provided.Mehta refuted the allegation, stating that 12 people had already been permitted to meet Wangchuk. The bench remarked, “Grounds have to be supplied as per judgments of this court. Why withhold it from his wife?” Mehta said the law requires grounds of arrest to be served on the detenue, not the wife, but added, “We will examine it.No issues as such, but we don’t want them to create a new ground to challenge the detention order. ”The SG also claimed a hype was being created in the media, which Sibal strongly rebutted. The two got entangled in counter-allegations until the bench intervened, asking both not to make emotional arguments. In a lighter vein, Sibal said, “The SG kept provoking me and I fell into his trap.”Justice Aravind Kumar, smiling, remarked, “We do not know what is going on,” to which Sibal replied, “You should know what is going on.”Wangchuk was detained under NSA on September 26, days after protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh left four dead. Angmo has sought President Droupadi Murmu’s intervention for his release.","Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, UT on wife's plea.

Activist Sonam Wangchuk Arrested, Internet Snapped In Leh After Deadly Ladakh Clashes

SRINAGAR: Leh Apex Body (LAB), a grouping of religious and political organisations in Ladakh, rejected Monday government’s claims of normalcy in the region and accused authorities of harassing village heads (gobas) by summoning them for questioning“In our villages, gobas (nambardars) play a vital role. Nothing happens without their consent. When LAB began its hunger strike on September 10, village heads informed their villages about it. Now they are being summoned and questioned. We see this as an attack on our culture and will not accept it,” LAB co-chairman Chhering Dorje Lakruk said at a presser in Leh.Environmental activist and LAB member Sonam Wangchuk led the fast demanding Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh before the protests snowballed into violence on Sept 24, killing four people and injuring over 70. Wangchuk was arrested on Sept 26 and remains jailed under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In Ladakh, a goba is a village headman chosen periodically by villagers through voice vote. The system remains effective as people traditionally follow the gobas’ guidance. “Some gobas were detained earlier but released due to our intervention. It is their job to inform people about the issues and the hunger strike of LAB.They shouldn’t be harassed for it,” Lakruk said.He questioned the government’s claims of normalcy, pointing to the gobas’ questioning and continued internet suspension. “The restrictions are still in place and people are being harassed,” Lakruk said. Govt should restore internet, stop arrests, lift restrictions and rebuild public confidence if it wants to normalise the situation, the LAB co-chairman said.On Saturday, Ladakh authorities had asserted that the situation was returning to normalcy while reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to a dialogue to address the aspirations of the people. The government had lauded the people of Ladakh were known for their peace-loving nature, fierce patriotism and their contribution to nation-building in securing its frontiers.After the violence of Sept 24, the authorities had imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended internet, and arrested more than 60 people. While the administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violence, LAB and another umbrella group Kargil Democratic Alliance have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge.The two groups also withdrew from talks scheduled for Monday with a Union home ministry high-powered committee, seeking Wangchuk’s release and an impartial investigation.",Leh Apex Body (LAB) rejects Monday government’s claims of normalcy in the region.

Five of the victims were Nepalis.CM Banerjee, who arrived in north Bengal Monday, announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of each deceased. ""One member of each of the families will get job as a special home guard,"" she said after visiting Jalpaiguri's Nagrakata.Four of the eight bodies Monday were found in Nagrakata. The other four were recovered in Cooch Behar. The flood waters led to the collapse of several bridges.

The link to Mirik, disrupted by the devastation of a key bridge over Balason river, will be restored soon, she added.","Till Sunday, 28 bodies were recovered in north Bengal's hills and plains.

Coldrif tragedy: Drug to fight hooch poisoning antidote to killer cough syrup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gmch-nagpur-docs-used-anti-hooch-poisoning-drug-to-contain-damage-by-killer-cough-syrup/articleshow/124350625.cms,"Representative image

NAGPUR: A drug usually administered on hooch (spurious liquor) poisoning victims proved to be the antidote for the damage caused by the killer cough syrup, Coldrif, which allegedly killed 15 children from Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara district and severely affected several others below the age of 12 since August.When all standard treatments failed and children continued to succumb, the department of paediatrics at GMCH, Nagpur, led by Dr Manish Tiwari, held scientific discussions with reputed paediatricians and decided to administer Fomepizole — a drug generally used as an antidote in confirmed or suspected cases of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning.Lab reports from Tamil Nadu confirmed Coldrif contained 48.6% diethylene glycol (DEG), a toxic industrial solvent used in brake fluids and antifreeze.While six children from Madhya Pradesh died of renal failure at GMCH alone when the cause was unknown, six managed to survive, but are in a critical condition. ""Two have begun passing urine, but are in deep coma, while four others are still unable to pass urine. DEG concentration was 500% (48.6%) and has left them with severe brain damage too,"" said Dr Tiwari. These kids were brought to Nagpur between September 26 and October 4 and by then the role of killer syrup was established.Fomepizole, commonly administered in liquor poisoning cases, was found to be largely effective against DEG toxicity, officials said. Its timely use prevented further fatalities and showed positive outcomes among patients currently under treatment, civic health officials confirmed.The treatment protocol was promptly shared with private hospitals and Chhindwara health authorities, who were instructed to start administering Fomepizole on patients being sent to Nagpur, as it is effective if started within 18 hours of poisoning.""The sudden death of three children in August within hours of admission at Nagpur GMCH raised suspicion. GMCH immediately alerted Nagpur Municipal Corporation's Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), which directly coordinates with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). A central and state team of experts visited Chhindwara and Nagpur to conduct a detailed analysis of the reported cases and deaths in coordination with Madhya Pradesh state authorities,"" top officials told TOI.Doctors were initially perplexed when multiple clinical, environmental, and entomological samples taken by these teams and sent to NIV Pune and NEERI Nagpur for testing, did not show the cause of acute kidney injuries.Once preliminary findings ruled out common infectious diseases, doctors began searching for a common link. ""Coldrif, prescribed by the same doctor to all affected children, turned out to be the culprit. Once DEG poisoning was confirmed, the picture became clear,"" officials said.Renowned paediatrician Dr Anand Bhutada, director of New Era Mother and Child Hospital, where four children from Madhya Pradesh were treated last month, said, ""Initially, we had no specific drug for the unexplained kidney failure. Hooch poisoning involves the same contaminant as DEG. After using Fomepizole, we observed gradual improvement in the children's kidney function."" Three of these kids were discharged while one succumbed.""We cannot say with certainty, but this was the only medicine that appeared to help flush out the toxicity from the body, apart from haemodialysis. The rest was supportive care,"" Dr Bhutada added.","Fomepizole, commonly administered in liquor poisoning cases, was found to be largely effective against DEG toxicity, officials said. Lab reports from Tamil Nadu confirmed Coldrif contained 48.6% diethylene glycol (DEG), a toxic industrial solvent used in brake fluids and antifreeze.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124350624,imgsize-641512,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-99.jpg"
Jammu and Kashmir: Omar government removes officer for warning teachers against flouting PDP-BJP era social media rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-omar-government-removes-officer-for-warning-teachers-against-flouting-pdp-bjp-era-social-media-rules/articleshow/124346363.cms,"File photo: J&K CM Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR: The National Conference government in Jammu & Kashmir on Monday removed the chief education officer of north Kashmir after he issued a circular warning teachers against posting comments related to policy matters on social media.J&K education secretary Ram Niwas Sharma issued an order attaching the officer, Bashir Ahmad Shah, to the Directorate of School Education, Kashmir, pending an inquiry. In the circular issued Saturday (Oct 4), Shah had mentioned that the education secretary had raised concerns during a review meeting the previous day over the misuse of social media by teaching and non-teaching staff.The circular said any violation of the December 2017 social media guidelines could attract disciplinary action, including censure, fine up to one month’s salary, withholding of increment or promotion, demotion, premature retirement, or dismissal from service.The guidelines were not meant to discourage the constructive use of social media, the circular stated, but cautioned staff to refrain from “unwarranted debates, discussions, or posting inappropriate content”.The guidelines, issued by the then PDP-BJP dispensation, bar government employees from engaging in political discussions, criticising government policies and actions, or posting or endorsing political or communal content online. PDP legislator Waheed Parra criticised Shah’s circular, calling it “deeply concerning”. “In an already numb Jammu and Kashmir, this order warning teachers and staff against raising their voice is deeply concerning. A govt that came to office on the promise of giving people a voice is now contributing to silencing the few remaining ones,” Parra said.NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq responded that the circular was based on guidelines framed by the PDP-BJP government in 2017. However, the Omar Abdullah govt still removed the officer.","J&K education secretary Ram Niwas Sharma issued an order attaching the officer, Bashir Ahmad Shah, to the Directorate of School Education, Kashmir, pending an inquiry.

Insurrection Act: Trump signals its use to deploy more troops in Democratic-led states — Can he invoke it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/insurrection-act-trump-signals-its-use-to-deploy-more-troops-in-democratic-led-states-can-he-invoke-it/articleshow/124351244.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)

What is the Insurrection Act?







US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act “if it was necessary,” especially if courts or state and local officials obstruct his efforts to deploy the National Guard.""I’d do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn’t been necessary. But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,"" Trump said, addressing reporters in the Oval Office when asked under what circumstances he might invoke the rarely used 19th-century law.""If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that. I mean, I want to make sure that people aren't killed. We have to make sure that our cities are safe,"" he said.The Insurrection Act of 1807 grants the president authority to deploy the US military for civilian law enforcement under specific conditions and was last invoked during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, as cited by NBC News.An early version of the Insurrection Act was initially enacted by Congress in 1792 to “provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.”The law has undergone several amendments over the ensuing centuries.Before invoking the Act, the president is required to first call on the “insurgents” to disperse, according to a 2006 Congressional Research Service report. If order is not restored, the president may then issue an executive order to deploy troops.The law was designed for situations in which local and state authorities are unable or unwilling to maintain order, with the military serving as a last-resort backstop, said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, as cited by the New York Times.In general, the law prohibits using the military as a domestic police force. However, the Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy the military to suppress an insurrection if a state government requests assistance. The president also has some discretion in determining whether the unrest is interfering with the enforcement of US laws.The Act was last invoked in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots, which erupted after four white police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist.Trump’s comments on the Act come amid his plans to federalize troops to tackle crime in cities led by Democratic officials.The state of Illinois and the City of Chicago filed a lawsuit on Monday morning seeking to block the Trump administration from deploying military troops to the city.A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday also blocked the administration from sending federalized National Guard members from California or other states to Portland’s streets.",The Insurrection Act of 1807 grants the president authority to deploy the US military for civilian law enforcement under specific conditions.

With only a month left for the mayoral election, Zojran Mamdani visited the two oldest temples of the city in Flushing, Queens, where he spoke about his Hindu connection. Before his mayoral run, Mamdani was in the news for leading a hate mob in NYC that targeted Ram Mandir. On Sunday, he said the Hindu community has been showcasing what 'seva' (service) looks like for decades, oftentimes without any recognition.""I am proud that I would be the first Indian-American mayor of this city. I am proud of the fact that my mother's family is Hindu. And I grew up with a keen understanding, whilst myself being a Muslim, what Hinduism means. The stories that I learned, the tradition, the faith, the practises, whether it's Raksha Bandhan, Diwali, Holi...it's one thing that taught me many of the values that I hold so dear today,"" Mamdani said.Mamdani also said that his mother Mira Nair told him that he was named Zohran because it means the first star in the sky.""For Gujaratis, Punjabis, for Indians across the city and the world, I would not be here, were it not the family that raised me and the family that taught me the values, the ideals I hold. Those are values and ideals that make me proud to be an Indian-American,"" Mamdani said, adding that the temple safeguarded the freedom of religion not only for the Hindus of New York but all New Yorkers.The mayoral poll is now tilted in favor of Mamdani after he received endorsements from top Democrats, including former VP Kamala Harris, and the exit of Eric Adams from the race. Mamdani and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo are now the frontrunners; Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is still in the fray.","Zohran Mamdani visited the two oldest temples of the city in Flushing, Queens, where he spoke about his Hindu connection.

Context: Legal differences and family impact





A tragic end has come for Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British teenager who was released from a Dubai prison earlier this year after serving time for having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl while on holiday. Just three months after regaining his freedom, Fakana died following a police pursuit and subsequent car collision in Tottenham, north London.Marcus Fakana’s story is marked by legal troubles overseas, emotional hardship, and a sudden fatal incident back home. In 2024, while vacationing with his parents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Fakana entered a relationship with a girl who was almost 18 at the time. The relationship, which began as a “holiday romance,” was reported to authorities by the girl’s mother after she discovered messages between the two upon their return to the UK. Under Emirati law, having a sexual relationship with someone under 18 is illegal, despite the UK’s age of consent being 16. Fakana was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison in Dubai. He was later granted a royal pardon by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai’s ruler, in July 2025.Only three months after his release—from July 3 to October 3—Fakana’s life was cut short in a car accident following a police chase in London.He was a passenger in a car which failed to stop after being requested to by the Metropolitan Police. The collision occurred shortly after midnight on Pretoria Road, Tottenham, when officers attempted to stop a “vehicle of interest.” The police pursued the vehicle for about 60 seconds before losing sight of it. The car was later found on The Roundway, having collided with another vehicle. Fakana was rushed to the hospital but died in the early hours of Friday.The driver of the vehicle involved in the crash, Marwaan Mohamed Huseen, 19, from Argyle Road, Tottenham, has been charged with several offences:Huseen appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on Saturday and has been remanded into custody. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 30 at the Old Bailey. Following the incident, the Metropolitan Police’s Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) were notified to investigate the circumstances around the police chase and crash.Radha Stirling, CEO of the campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported Fakana during his imprisonment, expressed deep sorrow over his passing. She highlighted the severe emotional toll Fakana endured:“Marcus spent the majority of this year in a Dubai prison which no doubt caused him long-lasting mental anguish. It’s sad that of all of 2025, he was only free for the three months from the 3rd of July until the 3rd of October.”Stirling further noted that Fakana was “grateful for the compassion shown to him by the British public” and that his experience led him to embrace Christianity and prayer. Despite the hardships, he was hopeful about his future and thankful for his regained freedom.Raphaella Stirling, crisis manager at Detained in Dubai, echoed these sentiments on social media, saying:“Marcus had only been released from prison earlier this year. Despite everything he endured, he embraced his freedom with renewed faith, joy, and hope for the future. His loss is a painful reminder of how precious life is and how unnecessary imprisonment robs people of time they can never regain.”Friends and supporters also paid tribute to Fakana online, with many expressing heartbreak and sorrow over his untimely death. One comment reflected the frustration felt by those who had campaigned for his release: “I fought for you to be released from prison in Dubai, I did my best and this is how it ended.”Fakana’s arrest and imprisonment stemmed from differing legal standards between the UAE and the UK. While the UK permits consensual sexual relationships from age 16, the UAE enforces stricter laws where sex under 18 is illegal. Fakana and the girl involved kept their relationship secret due to her family’s strictness and had planned to continue seeing each other back in the UK.The emotional consequences of the case have been profound. Fakana’s mother and family remain supported by specialist officers after his death. His story highlights the significant impact of overseas imprisonment on mental health and the devastating loss of a young life just as it was beginning to regain normalcy.","Marcus Fakana, 19, was released from a Dubai prison earlier this year.

The Peace Prize Paradox







If Donald Trump could trademark “peace,” he would. Ahead of the Nobel Peace Prize announcement on October 10, the president is campaigning harder for Oslo’s approval than he ever did for Wisconsin’s votes. His newest pitch? A “20-point Gaza peace plan” that he claims could end one of the world’s most intractable conflicts — and win him the most coveted medal not made in Mar-a-Lago.He calls it “the greatest peace deal of all time.” The Nobel Committee is unlikely to agree.Trump’s obsession with the Nobel isn’t new. He’s been demanding it since the Abraham Accords, arguing that if Barack Obama got one for “showing up,” he should get at least two for “saving the Middle East.” This year, though, his lobbying has gone full diplomatic theatre.At the UN, he declared that “everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” Behind closed doors, his envoy Steve Witkoff has been nudging European counterparts; Marco Rubio has been reminding allies; and Pfizer’s Albert Bourla has even chimed in, praising Operation Warp Speed as Nobel-worthy. The entire MAGA machine has turned into a PR agency for peace — peace, of course, defined by Trump himself.The timing of Trump’s Gaza initiative is not accidental. Days before the Nobel announcement, he unveiled a 20-point plan that supposedly guarantees ceasefire, reconstruction, and hostage release. Hamas agreed to free all captives but insisted the rest “requires negotiation” — which, in diplomatic language, means “we’ll see after the cameras leave.”For Trump, that’s enough to sell it as a historic breakthrough. For the Nobel Committee, which prefers long-term stability to press-conference theatre, it’s a tougher call.The Norwegians find themselves in an awkward spot. Their $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund recently divested from Israeli firms, triggering fury among US Republicans. Trump has already slapped 15 percent tariffs on Norwegian imports and could easily escalate if snubbed.Nordic political culture prizes understatement. Trump’s entire personality is a federal crime in Norway. As Professor Hilde Restad notes, “Culturally, Trump is very much an antithesis for Norway.” In simpler terms, you don’t shout your way to a Peace Prize.Yet Trump’s logic is pure branding: keep shouting until someone mistakes the noise for applause. Even if he loses, he wins the narrative — the victim of a “rigged Nobel,” wronged by “global elites,” and vindicated by “real Americans.”This year’s 338 nominees include journalists’ groups, Sudan’s aid volunteers, and Yulia Navalnaya. Trump’s nomination came courtesy of New York congresswoman Claudia Tenney, who has built an international support network lobbying for his win. Ukraine’s Oleksandr Merezhko also nominated him — then withdrew, saying he’d “lost trust” after Trump ignored Russia’s attacks on Kyiv.But withdrawals don’t trend on Truth Social.Online odds place Trump third, behind Navalnaya and Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms. But Nobel betting is notoriously unreliable — last year’s favourite was Navalny himself, despite posthumous awards being banned.If he loses, expect a digital onslaught. If he wins, expect a victory rally featuring the phrase “greatest Nobel in history.” Either way, Trump’s base will celebrate — because in MAGA world, perception is policy.The Nobel Peace Prize has never been about peace alone; it’s about symbolism. When Obama won, the committee bet on hope. When Liu Xiaobo won, it bet on defiance. When Trump lobbies, he bets on intimidation. The question for the Norwegian Nobel Committee is simple: reward the world’s loudest salesman for a peace plan still in beta, or uphold its century-old ideal of moral independence. If Trump doesn’t win, he’ll call it fake. If he does, he’ll call it destiny. Either way, come October 10, Oslo will once again prove Alfred Nobel’s greatest invention wasn’t dynamite. It was irony.",The president is campaigning harder for Oslo's approval than he ever did for Wisconsin's votes. His newest pitch?

Mumbai: To draw attention to their fare revision demand and govt's inaction against aggregator cab companies, Ola, Uber, and Rapido drivers across the state will shut passenger services for a day on Oct 9, announced union leader Keshav Kshirsagar from Bharatiya Gig Kamgar Manch in a media statement on Sunday.The protesters also announced that they will participate in a ""jail bharo"" agitation across the state. Sources in aggregator firms, however, said that services may be operational on Thursday as not all drivers are with the union.Pointing out that autorickshaw and taxi drivers have been protesting against the transport department's failure to take action against aggregators since July 15, Kshirsagar said: ""We protested at Azad Maidan, continuing agitation through various methods including hunger strikes, shutdowns, and demonstrations. All three companies — Ola, Uber, and Rapido — are illegally operating bike taxis in the state, trampling govt regulations, and despite filing several FIRs, passenger services on private two-wheelers continue. """"On Oct 9, when finance experts from across the country will be coming to Mumbai for a conference, we have decided to hold a one-day shutdown to draw Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to our issues, including inaction by the state transport department,"" he added.As vehicles will not be available to citizens that day, similar to the previous shutdown in July, there could be a strain on the public transport system and citizens may face major inconvenience, Kshirsagar added.The media statement stated: ""The shutdown called by the drivers' union has been receiving a massive response from drivers across the state. In July's shutdown, 100% of drivers participated, prompting the airport administration to tweet asking citizens to arrange their own vehicles.""","Ola, Uber, and Rapido drivers across the state will shut passenger services for a day on Oct 9.

Over the course of their friendship, he allegedly invited her over and offered her a soft drink laced with sedatives.In her complaint, the woman alleged she lost consciousness, but realised she had been sexually assaulted when she came to.Confronted, the YouTuber allegedly pleaded for forgiveness and promised marriage, persuading the woman to remain silent due to fears of social stigma.The situation escalated when the accused took the actor to his family home and married her, insisting that the wedding remain a secret.The woman, according to her complaint, was then subjected to repeated sexual exploitation — including acts described as unnatural — and was pressured by the YouTuber's family to convert to Islam. She claimed that when she resisted, she was physically assaulted, coerced into reciting religious texts and consuming foods against her beliefs.The woman was allegedly forced to undergo an abortion after being given pills without her consent. The pattern of abuse included threats from the accused's family and even demands for money, both in cash and online transfers.Over time, she discovered that the YouTuber had also maintained relationships with multiple women and had two children from an earlier marriage.Fearing for her safety, the woman approached police and filed a formal complaint.""I fear that the accused might get me killed.

The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX , led by Elon Musk , five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million. The contracts are said to reinforce SpaceX’s dominance in Pentagon space contracts, despite recent public tensions between Musk and President Donald Trump. United Launch Alliance (ULA) secured the remaining two missions for $428 million.The contracts fall under the National Security Space Launch Program (NSSL), which previously selected SpaceX, ULA, and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin for 54 missions worth $13.5 billion, scheduled between 2027 and 2032. “Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security,” said Col Eric Zarybnisky of the U.S. Space Systems Command, per Air & Space Forces.“Delivering assets to the warfighter is our ultimate mission, and we rely on strong government-industry partnerships to achieve that goal.” SpaceX’s missions include launching a communication satellite, three classified payloads, and a reconnaissance satellite, with launches expected in 2027 due to the Space Force’s two-year advance planning. Meanwhile, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, a competitor to SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, remains uncertified for NSSL missions and was not assigned any launches for this cycle.Blue Origin’s next chance for a mission is in fiscal year 2027, though its upcoming NASA Mars mission—delayed from 2024 and potentially launching by month’s end—could advance its certification prospects.The awards is reported to highlight SpaceX’s lead in national security space launches, while Blue Origin continues to push for a stronger foothold in the competitive space race.","The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million.

Trump Calls Tariff His Favourite Word Amid Ongoing India Tariff Dispute





US President Donald Trump has once again claimed that he prevented a potential conflict between India and Pakistan using the power of tariffs. Responding to a question on whether he would reconsider his stance on tariffs, Trump said they were a key tool in stopping wars and maintaining global peace.US President Donald Trump addressed questions on whether he would reconsider his stance on tariffs, emphasising their importance for the United States’ economic strength and global influence.He described tariffs as a crucial tool that not only generates billions of dollars but also positions the US as a “peacekeeper” on the world stage.Trump later claimed that his use of tariffs played a role in preventing potential hostilities between India and Pakistan.Trump on Monday while speaking to reporters said, “If I didn't have the power of tariffs, you would have at least four of the seven wars raging. I use tariffs to stop wars. If you look at India and Pakistan, they were ready to go at it. Seven planes were shot down. They were ready to go at it. And then nuclear powers. I don't want to say exactly what I said, but what I said was very effective. They stopped. And that was based on tariffs.He also described tariffs as central to the United States’ role as a peacekeeper. “Tariffs are very important for the United States. We are a peacekeeper because of tariffs. Not only do we make hundreds of billions of dollars, but we're a peacekeeper because of tariffs,” he added.This is not the first time Trump has made such a claim. At a private dinner with Republican lawmakers at the White House last month, he said, “We stopped a lot of wars. And these were serious, India and Pakistan, that was going on… These are two serious nuclear countries, and they were hitting each other. You know, it seems like a new form of warfare.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also clarified in Parliament that no foreign leader influenced India’s decision to end Operation Sindoor.Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district on April 22, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists, killed 26 people.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, with the Indian Air Force targeting nine major terror hubs inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan attempted to retaliate with drones and missile strikes, which were intercepted by Indian air defence systems. The IAF responded with precision strikes on 11 Pakistani airbases, including strategic facilities at Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.",US President Donald Trump has once again claimed that he prevented a potential conflict between India and Pakistan using the power of tariffs.

Putin's Shocking Message On Charlie Kirk; 'Americans Should Know That In Russia...' | WATCH





Social media is on fire over the silence from the Republicans on 17-year-old Vincent Battiloro, a MAGA and Charlie Kirk fan, who has been charged with intentionally hitting and killing two girls. Battiloro stalked Maria Niotis for days, according to neighbors and then he hit her and her friend Isabella Salas, leading to their death.Days before this happened, Battiloro alleged on YouTube that a girl from his school was causing him legal trouble by bringing false allegations against him involving child porn.Even after their death, he came online and said there was more to the story. He said he's a nice kid with a good family by his side but some baseless allegations have been ruining everything.He said Maria mocked Charlie Kirk's murder by resharing something critical of Kirk on TikTok. “Whenever Maria sees the pizza guy come, better think of Charlie Kirk for making fun of his f--king death,” he says, according to the video. “Stupid-ass clown. Just remember that.” The pizza context was that on the livestream, he said he would order pizza to Maria's home and make her pay for it.Maria's family in a statement called Battiloro “a coward of a man, who had been plotting this attack against Maria for months, carried out this horrific act, taking not only her life but also Isabella’s.”“You should not have accused me of sending porn, and you should not have dragged me into creating a police report,” he said, referencing not just Maria but her mother by name.“You made a bad decision making a bad name of myself.”Maria's mother reported to the police numerou times that her daughter was being stalked but nothing was done, according to reports.NJ.com reported that on his livestreams and social media posts, Battiloro also expressed admiration for Andrew Tate, a controversial online influencer who is accused of running a criminal sex trafficking ring in Romania.","17-year-old Vincent Battiloro, a MAGA and Charlie Kirk fan, has been charged with intentionally hitting and killing two girls.

US shutdown: Burbank Airport unmanned for hours; ground delays expected at major US airports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-burbank-airport-unmanned-for-hours-ground-delays-expected-at-major-us-airports/articleshow/124352735.cms,"Representative photo (AP)





The Federal Aviation Administration warned that Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening, as the government shutdown leaves many airport staff working without pay.The staffing shortage was scheduled to begin at 4.15 pm and continue until approximately 10.00 pm (local time).Air traffic controllers confirmed that their responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to Southern California TRACON, an approach and departure team based in San Diego, which will communicate with pilots landing and taking off from the airport, as reported by ABC News.Officials expect minimal disruption for travelers, though the full impact remains uncertain.An FAA advisory notes that several staffing triggers have been activated, resulting in ground delays at airports in Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Phoenix.Air travel delays were widely anticipated as the government shutdown extended into its sixth day on Monday following a failed Senate vote. During the shutdown, numerous airport employees, including air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay.Control towers and airport security checkpoints continue to operate, with roughly 13,200 air traffic controllers and over 61,000 TSA employees expected to remain on duty.California Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the staffing shortage at Burbank Airport to US President Donald Trump.“Thanks, @realDonaldTrump! Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4.15 pm to 10.00 pm today because of YOUR government shutdown,” Newsom said through a post on X.During the 35-day government shutdown in 2019, absences among air traffic controllers and TSA officers increased as employees missed paychecks, leading to longer checkpoint wait times at some airports. Air traffic in New York was slowed as a result, putting additional pressure on lawmakers to resolve the standoff quickly.The current shutdown comes amid existing staffing shortages at both the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration, including a deficit of roughly 3,000 air traffic controllers. If the system cannot manage the scheduled flights, the FAA may slow landings and takeoffs, leading to increased delays and cancellations for passengers, as cited by ABC News.Meanwhile, as the US government shutdown entered its sixth day on Monday, the Senate once again rejected funding proposals from both parties. The Democratic plan failed 45–55, and the Republican measure was defeated 52–42, with both falling short of the 60 votes needed for approval.",Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening. The staffing shortage was scheduled to begin at 4.15 pm and continue until approximately 10.00 pm. Air traffic controllers confirmed that their responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to an approach and departure team based in San Diego.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124352799,imgsize-303047,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-photo-ap.jpg"

""I call him Puff Daddy, [he] has asked me for a pardon.""Combs was sentenced on Friday to over four years in prison.He will receive credit for the 12 months he has already served at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his arrest in September 2024, and will be fined $500,000.Combs' lawyers, who spoke exclusively with ABC News on Friday, stated they are considering an appeal, arguing that the judge unfairly imposed a sentence four times longer than requested and that it was based on unproven allegations not included in the conviction.""The jury made it very clear in their verdict that they acquitted him of the sex trafficking and the RICO counts,"" lead attorney Teny Geragos said at the time. ""Not guilty means not guilty.""According to a letter from his legal team, Combs has requested to serve his sentence at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey that houses about 4,000 inmates and offers a drug treatment programme known as RDAP, the Residential Drug Abuse Programme.""In order to address drug abuse issues and to maximise family visitation and rehabilitative efforts, we request that the Court strongly recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr Combs be placed at FCI Fort Dix for RDAP purposes and any other available educational and occupational programmes,"" defence attorney Teny Geragos said in the letter on Monday.Trump's comments followed a question about another possible pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell , a former associate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Maxwell's appeal challenging her sex trafficking conviction, without providing an explanation. ""I'll take a look at it,"" Trump said. ""I will speak to the Justice Department,"" he added. Maxwell is currently serving a prison sentence for her role in assisting Epstein to recruit, groom and abuse underage girls as part of a sex trafficking scheme.","Donald Trump says Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has asked him for a pardon.

A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning, leaving her ex-senator husband, Arnold Goodstein, and two other family members hospitalized.Goodstein's four-bedroom, four-bath $1,155,200 home, stretching up a three-story property on Edisto Beach, was engulfed in flames around 11.30 am as stunned neighbors looked on. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause, while dramatic drone footage captured the inferno consuming the residence.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is investigating the fire, a spokesperson confirmed. Although Goodstein was not present at the time, multiple family members, including her ex-senator husband Arnold Goodstein, were at home. South Carolina Chief Justice John Kittredge stated that the fire resulted from an ""apparent explosion,"" Daily Mail reported""Judge Goodstein was walking on the beach when the fire started. Her husband, Arnie, was in the house with children and perhaps grandchildren. The family had to escape by jumping from a window or balcony. I’m told there were injuries from the fall, such as broken legs,"" Kittredge said.Of the three family members hospitalised, Arnold Goodstein is reported to have leaped from the burning building after assisting other family members to escape.""Arnie’s injuries may have been the most serious, for he was airlifted to the hospital,"" Kittredge added.He sustained multiple broken bones in his hips, legs and feet, according to reports. Another hospitalised individual is reported to be Goodstein's son, Arnold Goodstein II.Their current condition remains unclear.Kittredge mentioned that SLED chief Mark Keel stated he would stay in touch and inform if there is any evidence of arson. ""At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Chief Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security,"" he added.Goodstein had reportedly been receiving death threats in recent weeks. ""She's had multiple death threats over the years,"" a judge close to Goodstein told the outlet. In early September, she was involved in a controversial case regarding whether voters' personal information in South Carolina could be handed over to the government.Goodstein issued a temporary restraining order in early September, stemming from a lawsuit challenging the South Carolina Election Commission's ability to provide voters’ data to the Department of Justice, The Gazette reported.However, the order was later overturned after a six-page opinion from the Supreme Court criticised Goodstein's process in barring the state from complying. The Supreme Court, signed by all five justices, criticised Goodstein for not detailing the damage that would occur from the release of voters' personal information, specifically that of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the suit to prevent her information from being disclosed to the federal govt.","A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown and asked them to ""open our government tonight.""

At the center of the dispute are expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, with Democrats seeking their extension while Republicans are pushing for a “clean” funding bill without what they describe as policy riders.This shutdown could have far-reaching consequences compared with previous ones. Unlike past temporary disruptions, the Trump administration is reportedly using the crisis to reshape the federal workforce, with agencies instructed to prepare “reduction-in-force” notices, effectively laying off employees in programs that do not align with the president’s priorities.The standoff could furlough up to 750,000 federal workers, disrupt essential services, and inflict significant damage on the US economy.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

"'Gratitude is due ...': Pakistan takes a U-turn; after Dar's objection, PM Shehbaz hails Trump's Gaza peace plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gratitude-is-due-pakistan-takes-a-u-turn-after-dars-objection-pm-shehbaz-hails-trumps-gaza-peace-plan/articleshow/124307025.cms,"‘They Back This 100%’: Trump Hails Pakistan’s Strong Stand on Gaza Deal





A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is heading Pakistan’s delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, has been detained by Israeli forces after they boarded the vessel, Dawn reported citing Pakistan Palestine Forum.In a post on X, the Pak Palestine Forum said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.”The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate Syed Uzair Nizami was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.”Flotilla's several vessels were stopped and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.“Already several vessels of the Hamas-Sumud flotilla have been safely stopped and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port. Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,"" the ministry said on X.The Global Sumud Flotilla, involving around 45 ships carrying over 500 politicians and activists, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg , had left Spain last month aiming to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza and send urgent humanitarian aid to the territory ravaged by starvation due to Israel’s military offensive.The organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla stated they were “illegally intercepted and boarded"" by Israel in international waters. “Around 8:30 pm Gaza time (1730 GMT), several vessels of the Global Sumud Flotilla, including the Alma, Sirius and Adara, were illegally intercepted and boarded by Israeli occupation forces in international waters,"" the flotilla said.Several countries condemned the Israeli interception. Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced he will expel all remaining Israeli diplomats over the interception. Turkey’s foreign minister called it “an act of terrorism that constitutes the most serious violation of international law and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.""Ahead of the interception, Spain and Italy, which sent naval escorts after the flotilla was struck with stun grenades and irritants in international waters off Greece, urged the ships to halt before entering Israel’s declared exclusion zone off Gaza. They called on the flotilla to “stop now"" and asked them to abandon its mission, but the activists said their decision was an attempt to “sabotage"" their endeavours.",Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan detained by Israeli forces after they boarded the vessel.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.
