'Security issue': Bangladesh halts visa services in India; tensions high amid violence against minorities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/security-issue-bangladesh-halts-visa-services-in-india-tensions-high-amid-violence-against-minorities/articleshow/126417947.cms,"(Photo credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in India to temporarily suspend visa services.

Sawaal poochhne ka waqt kab ka nikal chuka hai.

History might disagree, at least in the cinematic verse. Everything repeats, and the return of angry young men on screen is one such phenomena. And so is the hyper nationalistic movies.Half a century ago, that line fromdidn’t just earn applause — it gave voice to a generation’s anger. Today, that anger is back in Indian cinema, louder, bloodier and far more profitable. Withstorming the box office and rewriting records week after week, the return of the angry young man is no longer a creative coincidence. It is a cultural moment. But this time, the anger isn’t quite pointing in the same direction.Released on December 5,has only begun to slow down in its fifth week after a month-long, record-breaking run. The Ranveer Singh-led film, featuring Arjun Rampal, R Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt and Akshaye Khanna, has crossed the lifetime collections ofand. It has stayed remarkably strong despite competition from Hollywood spectacleand Hindi releases such asand. Its success is not just about scale or star power — it signals how deeply the angry male protagonist has re-entered the mainstream imagination.From here, Indian cinema’s relationship with anger, power and masculinity tells a story that is as political as it is cinematic.The template was set in the 1970s against the backdrop of Emergency. In, Amitabh Bachchan’s Vijay Khanna tells the system exactly where it stands. In, when asked to choose between law and loyalty, he delivers one of Hindi cinema’s most enduring lines: “Mere paas maa hai.” It wasn’t bravado. It was a moral position.The angry young man of that era was shaped by a country struggling with inflation, unemployment, labour unrest and widespread corruption. Films like(1975),(1979) and(1981) were steeped in a sense of betrayal. The state had promised dignity and justice; instead, it delivered scarcity and indifference.These protagonists were anti-establishment by design. They didn’t trust institutions because institutions had failed them. When Bachchan growled, “Aaj khush toh bahut hoge tum,” it was a class confrontation. Film scholars often describe this phase using Antonio Gramsci’s idea of counter-hegemony: cinema became a site where the working class could symbolically push back against dominant power structures.Violence existed, but it was rarely celebratory. The angry young man was tragic, burdened by his choices, aware that justice came at a cost.Fast forward to the last decade, and the angry man is back—bigger, louder and more commercially potent than ever. Films likeandhave drawn massive audiences across languages.But listen closely to what these men are angry about.In, the protagonist declares, “Jo mera nahi ho sakta, woh kisi aur ka bhi nahi ho sakta.” His rage isn’t directed at a broken system but at a woman who refuses to conform. In, Ranbir Kapoor’s character boasts, “Papa ke liye main kuch bhi kar sakta hoon,” as familial obsession morphs into unchecked violence. The films don’t question these impulses—they aestheticise them.Even in, when Allu Arjun swaggers through the forest declaring, “Pushpa naam sunke flower samjhe kya? Fire hai main,” the line captures the shift. Pushpa doesn’t dismantle corruption; he perfects it. His rebellion is not against power, but against exclusion from power.Similarly,’s Rocky doesn’t dream of reform. He dreams of domination. His worldview is summed up in the idea that power must be seized and held at any cost, not questioned or redistributed.This is the crucial difference between the angry men of the 1970s and today. Earlier heroes fought corrupt systems because those systems denied dignity. Today’s heroes often aspire to control the system itself.Film theory helps explain this turn. Where earlier cinema channelled collective anger, contemporary films reflect a more individualistic worldview. Neoliberal masculinity—where success is personal, dominance is virtue, and empathy is weakness—has found a powerful visual language in popular cinema.The audience response is telling. Viewers cheer not because the hero questions authority, but because he exercises it without restraint. Anger has shifted from resistance to entitlement.Running parallel to this trend is the rise of overtly pro-state films. Titles such asandhave framed the state as decisive, morally upright and beyond scrutiny.In, the line “How’s the josh?” became a national catchphrase—not of protest, but of affirmation. The cinema of anger, once suspicious of power, now often works in sync with it.Political communication scholars note that popular culture doesn’t merely mirror public sentiment—it helps shape it. When rage is directed outward at designated enemies rather than upward at systems of power, it reinforces the status quo rather than challenging it.Since Dhurandhar divided people over whether to appreciate the filmmaking of it or criticise the propaganda of it, Hindi film industry actor Hrithik Roshan put it the right way: “I may disagree with the politics of it, and argue about the responsibilities us filmmakers should bear as citizens of the world. Nevertheless, can’t ignore how I loved and learnt from this one as a student of cinema. Amazing.”Andhadhun actor Radhika Apte too, recently expressed concern over the rise in violence in Indian cinema.""I'm deeply disturbed by the violence at the moment that is selling as entertainment,"" said Apte in an interview with the Hollywood reporter. She did not shy away from calling out violence against women in films.""I find it disturbing that actresses are doing films that demean women,"" she said, calling for collective responsibility. ""I think we need to collectively stop doing them. They might be throwing money at you, but you're rich already. We need to stop because this is very harmful.""The angry men are back. They dominate box office charts, shape popular culture and command extraordinary influence. But unlike their predecessors, they no longer ask uncomfortable questions of power.The angry young man of the 1970s emerged from social fracture and spoke to collective injustice. Today’s angry man thrives on certainty—certain of his right to control, to punish, to dominate. His rage does not unsettle the system; it often reinforces it.Ascontinues its theatrical run, it prompts a larger question for Indian cinema: Is this a revival of rebellion, or has authority simply been repackaged in the language of anger?Well, Naseeruddin Shah's character inputs it right:","Released on December 5, has only begun to slow down in its fifth week after a month-long, record-breaking run.

"Medical college row: Omar says Jammu’s loss, blames protesters for ‘destroying’ students’ future; BJP & Hindu groups celebrate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-college-row-omar-says-jammus-loss-blames-protesters-for-destroying-students-future-bjp-hindu-groups-celebrate/articleshow/126401866.cms,"SRINAGAR: BJP and Hindu groups on Wednesday celebrated the National Medical Commission’s decision to withdraw permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi, Jammu, to run an MBBS course from 2025-26 academic session, while J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.As activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti — a conglomerate of Hindu social and religious organisations that led an agitation against the admission of non-Hindu students to the shrine board-run medical college — held victory marches in Jammu, burst crackers and danced, Omar on Wednesday evening said it was unfortunate that people were celebrating the “closure of a medical college”. “In other parts of the country people fight to get such institutions,” he said. “If you are happy to destroy the future of our children, then go ahead and burst crackers.”The Sangharsh Samiti had been protesting since Nov against the admission of 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, in the first batch of 50, with only seven Hindus and one Sikh among the selected candidates. Its contention was that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students and those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi.CM Omar said within two years, the institute’s intake capacity would have risen to 400, of which about 250 would have come from Jammu. “Now, no one will get those seats because the college has been closed in the name of religion,” he said. Students who fail to secure admission in medical colleges in future should remember the role played by the Sangharsh Samiti in closing this institute, he added.On Tuesday, barely an hour before the NMC order, the CM had said the medical college was not worth running given the religious politics played around it, and had suggested shutting it down. “In the given scenario, I don’t feel the students themselves would like to study there. We request GoI and the health ministry to adjust these children in other colleges. Had I been a parent of these students, I wouldn’t send them there,” Omar had said.Although NMC stated that the Letter of Permission was being withdrawn as an inspection found non-compliance with minimum standards, the Sangharsh Samiti claimed it was a result of its prolonged agitation. “This is our first major victory,” its representatives said at a news briefing, adding, “Our current protest has ended but there are more issues, like the Shrine Board Act which needs amendment.”BJP’s J&K president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma, too, welcomed the NMC decision, and thanked LG Manoj Sinha and Union health minister J P Nadda, for withdrawal of permission while safeguarding the interests of selected students.Kashmir-based parties, however, slammed the decision, terming it Jammu’s loss, and blamed BJP. NC minister Javed Rana said admissions in educational institutions shouldn’t be sought on the basis of religion. He accused BJP of “communalising” the issue of admissions in SMVDIME.PDP called it “a ruthless setback” for Jammu region, and blamed BJP. “People of Jammu must wake up to the reality that religious polarisation only sabotages their future. This entire episode was cynically engineered by BJP for narrow political gains in the name of religion, and it is Jammu that has been made to pay the price,” PDP youth wing president Aditya Gupta said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

NEW DELHI: Pushing for expansion of NDA in Tamil Nadu, BJP is crafting a high-pitched campaign to position the alliance as a natural choice for anti-DMK voters amid emergence of actor Vijay-led TVK as the third force in the state's traditionally bipolar politics.AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami's meeting with home minister Amit Shah, a keen votary of widening the NDA tent in the poll-bound state, on Wednesday covered a range of issues related to the alliance's growth and agenda.That the PMK faction led by Anbumani Ramadoss was welcomed into NDA by EPS, as Palaniswami is commonly known, in Chennai hours before he met Shah in Delhi was as much about timing as about consolidating the alliance.However, EPS, the declared leader of NDA, has drawn a red line on including O Panneerselvam and Sasikala back into AIADMK or the alliance. In comments to media on Thursday, he reiterated his stand against them but offered no direct answer on TTV Dhinakaran, another former AIADMK functionary being spoken of as a prospective NDA member.BJP has long been of the view that the return of those once associated with AIADMK and its late leader J Jayalalithaa will send out a message of unity after the reverses it has suffered in elections.However, people familiar with the issue said BJP will ultimately go with EPS as it has already named him as leader of the alliance and believes an AIADMK-led front remains the best bet to defeat the DMK-Congress-Left combine.What has thrown up an imponderable in the poll equation is the emergence of TVK, which has gained in attraction for local satraps disaffected with their parent party or drawn by higher profiles on offer.With AIADMK under EPS ceding some space over the years, some functionaries have crossed over to TVK amid buzz that Panneerselvam and Dhinakaran may also move to the new outfit.A BJP functionary likened the attention and crowds Vijay is drawing to the buzz poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor had generated in Bihar, before his party came a cropper in the polls.Sources added that BJP would like to bring together all political forces, including TVK, opposed to the DMK-led front, but Vijay's projection of himself as the CM candidate and criticism of BJP's ideology have made such a prospect improbable. In fact, TVK has called Congress a natural ally amid a section of the national party openly indicating their unhappiness with DMK's refusal to share power and warm up to TVK.With issues far from settled in the state's governing alliance, NDA is planning to tie up the loose ends and shape the poll agenda by building a high-octane campaign around alleged corruption and misgovernance.",BJP is crafting a high-pitched campaign to position the alliance as a natural choice for anti-DMK voters in Tamil Nadu.

He was transferred to Srinagar, against which he unsuccessfully appealed in Central Administrative Tribunal.

Nagpur: A senior lecturer at a Maharashtra govt-run educational institute in Nagpur has been included for election duty on Jan 15, even though she has a chemotherapy session scheduled on that date, reports Abhishek Choudhari. The 56-year-old cancer patient's college officially wrote to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Dec 26, seeking cancellation of poll duty, citing health reasons. However, she again received a call on Jan 7 to attend a poll training workshop.After the civic body registered FIRs against four academics for refusing poll duty, the cancer patient was worried and scurried to the corporation office to get her name struck off. Till a week ago, at least 514 govt servants were issued show-cause notices in Amravati for remaining absent at training sessions. ""I don't want to lose my job or forego retirement benefits due to an adverse entry,"" the lecturer said.""My next chemotherapy session is on Jan 15, due to which we appealed for cancellation.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday kicked off the Somnath Swabhiman Parv, sharing pictures from his visit to the Somnath temple in 2001 and describing the year-long celebrations as a tribute to country's civilisational resilience.In a post on X, the Prime Minister said the Somnath Swabhiman Parv is about remembering “the countless children of Bharat Mata, who never compromised with their principles and ethos,” even in the most challenging times.“Jai Somnath! Somnath Swabhiman Parv begins today. A thousand years ago, in January 1026, Somnath faced its first-ever attack. The attack of 1026 and the subsequent attacks couldn't diminish the eternal faith of millions, nor break the civilisational spirit that rebuilt Somnath time and again,” PM Modi wrote.He added, “#SomnathSwabhimanParv is about remembering the countless children of Bharat Mata, who never compromised with their principles and ethos. However daunting the times were, their resolve remained unshaken and their commitment to our ethos unwavering.”The Prime Minister also shared glimpses from a programme held at Somnath on October 31, 2001, when the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the Somnath temple was commemorated.“I am also sharing with you some glimpses of a program organized in Somnath on October 31, 2001.

In 1951, that historic ceremony was held in the presence of the then President Dr. Rajendra Prasad Ji. The efforts of great personalities including Sardar Patel and KM Munshi Ji in the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple were extremely commendable,” he said.PM Modi noted that the 2001 programme was attended by several senior leaders, including then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and then Home Minister L. K. Advani.“In this program of the year 2001, the then Prime Minister Atal Ji and Home Minister Advani Ji and many dignitaries had participated.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a full forensic examination of a controversial 48-minute audio recording that allegedly shows former Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh 's involvement in the 2023 ethnic violence. The court directed the National Forensic Science University (NFSU) in Gandhinagar to analyze both the complete audio and Singh's admitted voice samples, with results to be submitted in a sealed cover, as reported by PTI.“The entire 48 minutes of the conversation in question along with the admitted voice recordings of the former Manipur CM are available... All the voice recordings furnished to the respondents by the learned counsel for the petitioner shall also be included therewith and forwarded to the National Forensic Science University Gandhinagar,” ordered the bench ordered.The case, which has been listed about 10 times, gained new momentum when lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights (KOHUR) Trust, presented the complete transcript. The state government, through Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, only recently received the full recording.This fresh examination comes after earlier controversy when the NFSU initially gave a clean chit, claiming the audio clips were tampered with. The court had expressed concern in December that only selected portions were previously analysed instead of the complete recording.The petition alleges that Biren Singh played a key role in violence against the Kuki-Zo community.According to lawyer Bhushan, the recorded conversation suggests state machinery's involvement in the ethnic clashes that killed over 260 people and displaced thousands since May 2023.The violence erupted after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' protested the Manipur High Court's order on Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status. Singh, who resigned as chief minister in February 2024 amid political pressure, is accused by KOHUR of orchestrating violence against Kuki-dominated areas.",Supreme Court orders full forensic examination of 48-minute audio recording.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list. An email from its representative and former US ambassador Paul W Jones to US diplomat Elizabeth K Horst on May 14, 2025, sought a meeting with Eric (Garcetti, US ambassador to India) to ""discuss and hear his perspectives to move the relationship forward"".The email read: ""Squire Patton Boggs is a registered agent of the govt of Pakistan. We'd very much appreciate your feedback on the attached one-page outline of ways forward in US-Pakistan relationship - Did we miss anything or would anything sound off-key in Washington? Separately, do you think we could try again to schedule a meeting with Eric to discuss and hear his perspectives on how best to move the relationship forward? Finally, I'd appreciate the opportunity to speak with you or a member of your team on FATF, in order to better understand the lay of the land. ""The firm is said to have circulated documents in diplomatic circles on behalf of Pak ""appreciating constructive role played by US and President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of J&K"".

Candace Owens Targets Macrons Again: 'Brigitte Puts On A Fake Wig, Lipstick And Declares War On...'

Candace Owens explains why she believes Ben Shapiro and The Daily Wire keep following her career





Candace Owens is again speaking out against her former workplace, The Daily Wire, and its co-founder Ben Shapiro. On January 8, 2026, Owens posted on X and accused the company of using clips from her old podcast to publicly target her. She said Ben Shapiro legally owns the show, but she believes the clips are now being used in a hostile way. Candace Owens wrote that the reused clips show her “defending myself against their repeated attacks against me over the last two years.” She added a clear message to her followers, saying, “This is real life. The Daily Wire is using my old podcast to attack me.”This post came just days after Owens again talked about her fallout with the company on her own podcast. She said the situation feels ongoing, not finished, even though she was fired nearly two years ago. Candace Owens was officially fired from The Daily Wire in March 2024 after months of public tension. Since then, she says she expected a clean break. Instead, she believes her former employer continues to follow her work and resurface old content linked to her name.On the January 6, 2026 episode of her podcast, Candace Owens shared new details about what she noticed online.She said listeners told her that her old Daily Wire YouTube channel had suddenly reappeared after being private for a long time. Along with that, a trailer filmed in 2021 was posted again.Candace Owens said similar things happened on Instagram, where an old promotional video from her early days at the company was reposted. She made it clear that she does not believe these moves were accidental.During the episode, Owens said being fired should mean both sides move on. She claimed that did not happen. Instead, she said her former employer continued to watch her career, affect speaking events, and apply pressure behind the scenes.Candace Owens described the situation in personal terms. She said, “I truly am not trying to be dramatic here. It felt like a crazy ex-stalker. Like if I cannot have you, nobody can have you.”She also said she believes the old clips are connected to a new show she feels is meant to mock her, though she did not present independent proof of that claim.The Daily Wire has not publicly responded to Owens’ January 8 post as of press time.Candace Owens joined The Daily Wire in 2021 and became one of its most visible hosts. According to CNN reporting dated March 22, 2024, her firing followed backlash over comments she made about Israel after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. Ben Shapiro called those remarks “absolutely disgraceful.”In later months, Candace Owens said being fired brought her more attention than ever. By November 2025, reports noted her podcast had become the number one show globally.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises New Questions About Charlie Kirk After Revealing A Never Before Seen Image With No Visible Blood",Candace Owens accuses Ben Shapiro of using her old podcast to publicly attack her after Daily Wire fallout.

Sean Strickland explains his stance on legality and the death of Renee Nicole Good

Public backlash grows as Renee Nicole Good's case remains under investigation

Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland ignited significant backlash online for his emotional response to the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.The occurrence took place during an ICE operation on early Wednesday morning and quickly became extremely controversial and, to some degree, an example of social media blowing up due to both the circumstances of Good's death and Sean Strickland's emotionally riddled reply.Shortly after the news broke, Sean Strickland made his feelings known by posting on social media the words ""Darwinism in full effect."" His post went viral almost immediately, with many individuals applauding Strickland's support for the safety of law enforcement officers, while many others criticized him for being insensitive in light of Ms. Good's death.As a result, Sean Strickland's actions caused him to be placed front and center of the ongoing national debate regarding law enforcement use of lethal force and the social responsibilities of citizens.Sean Strickland responded to very negative backlash for comments about Renee Nicole Good that he had made on social media. He made a further clarification through social media in which he stated that when someone runs over a police officer, it could create a lethal circumstance for the officer because he has no other choice but to use lethal force.Sean Strickland further clarified regarding his original statements. Sean stated that he did not consider the police officer's use of force to be morally acceptable, even if the law permitted it. Sean even stated that even though the law could support the officer's actions, the loss of life is a tragedy, and it does not take away from the fact that Renee Nicole Good died.In addition, Sean stated that he understands the tremendous mental strain that ICE agents face and that law enforcement officers go through many dangerous and very stressful situations throughout their careers. Sean also referred to the situation involving Renee Nicole Good as part of a larger issue regarding the nature of enforcement, as opposed to the individual officer's response to a particular incident.Sean Strickland's statements resulted in public outrage that grew during the course of the investigation into the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good. Several people have expressed that Sean does not possess any compassion for the loss of life of Renee Nicole Good or for her family.Other people have questioned the validity of Sean Strickland's statement that there would be no charges against the police officer involved and implied that the investigation would ultimately establish whether the officer had a legal right to use lethal force against Renee Nicole Good.Also Read: Professional mixed martial artist Sean Strickland has ""24/7"" mental breakdown as his reaction to Charlie Kirk's death goes viral.","Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland ignited significant backlash online for his emotional response to the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

What police say about Marshon Lattimore’s arrest in Ohio

What the Washington Commanders and NFL have said so far

Washington Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore was arrested in Ohio on charges related to carrying a concealed weapon and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, according to police records. The incident occurred earlier this week in Lakewood, Ohio, and the case is now pending further legal review. At this stage, authorities have not released extensive details surrounding the circumstances of the arrest.Lattimore, a veteran defensive back and former Pro Bowler, was taken into custody and later released, with the matter expected to proceed through the local court system.According to Lakewood police records, Lattimore was booked on two charges: carrying a concealed weapon and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle. Both charges fall under Ohio weapons statutes and are typically assessed based on how a firearm is stored, transported, or disclosed during a traffic stop or encounter with law enforcement.Officials have not indicated whether the case will be pursued as a misdemeanor or elevated further, as that determination is generally made following a prosecutor’s review. No additional details regarding the traffic stop or the events leading up to the arrest have been made public as of publication.The Washington Commanders have acknowledged awareness of the situation and indicated they are gathering more information. The team has not provided further comment on the matter, and no disciplinary action has been announced.The NFL has also not issued a public statement regarding Lattimore’s arrest. In similar situations, the league typically monitors developments before determining whether the personal conduct policy applies.Under Ohio law, a charge of carrying a concealed weapon generally relates to whether a firearm was properly disclosed or permitted under state regulations. Improper handling of firearms in a motor vehicle often concerns how a weapon is stored or accessed while driving, including whether it was secured, loaded, or within reach.The severity of these charges can vary significantly depending on the facts of the case, prior history, and prosecutorial discretion. At this stage, an arrest does not indicate guilt, and the legal process will determine next steps.This arrest is separate from a previous weapons-related case involving Lattimore in Ohio several years ago, which was resolved through the legal system at that time. There is no indication that the two matters are connected, and the current case will be evaluated independently based on its own facts.Also read - Fans accuse Travis Kelce of money laundering as his foundation comes under scrutiny","Washington Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore was arrested in Ohio on charges related to carrying a concealed weapon and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle.

PANAJI: Kargil War veteran and South Goa MP, Capt Viriato Fernandes, received a notice from Election Commission as part of SIR of electoral roll to appear with documents to prove his identity, prompting state chief electoral officer (CEO) to blame the BLO for dereliction of duty leading to auto generation of the notice.Goa CEO Sanjay Goel said a showcause notice will be issued to the BLO to see whether he made attempts to get the details from the MP.“I’m told that in his enumeration form, the MP did not mention the assembly constituency and the part number of the 2002 electoral roll, on the basis of which mapping is done. The BLO should have scrutinised this and sought the details from him. It was a lapse on the BLO’s part,” he said.“The system automatically generates notices to unmapped voters. At that stage too, it was missed... It’s not too late... the details will be sought from the MP and his name will not be deleted,” Goel added.Fernandes said the notice came despite EC subjecting LS poll candidates in 2024, including him, to the highest level of scrutiny.“If an MP can be subjected to this scrutiny, wonder about the state of a common man. It confirms concerns raised by opposition parties and NGOs/citizens about SIR being carried out by EC to delete names of legitimate voters and prevent them from participating in the democratic process of voting,” Fernandes said.The Lok Sabha MP added that he has voted since 1989 and has travelled to Goa multiple times from his military postings during his 26-year tenure in the Indian Navy just to cast his vote.The EC notice received by Fernandes notice states, “In view of no match/likely incorrect match with the electoral roll prepared during previous SIR, you are requested to appear before the undersigned on Jan 27, 2026, from 9am-12pm.... along with original documents prescribed by EC to retain your name in final electoral roll.”","Kargil War veteran and South Goa MP, Capt Viriato Fernandes, received a notice from Election Commission as part of SIR of electoral roll.

Charlie Kirk has also appeared publicly after the time Candace Owens referred to.Candace Owens used this photo while explaining why she said she does not trust Terryl Farnsworth and Tyler Bowyer. Her words caught attention fast, but many people also questioned the accuracy of her statements.While speaking on her show, Candace Owens said the photo showed Charlie Kirk from behind with no visible blood after the alleged shooting.Pointing to the image, she said the only blood seen was on his hand.Candace Owens said, “This doesn’t make sense to me. It doesn’t make sense to the narrative. Doesn’t make sense to anybody that knows anything about guns. Charlie was in pretty good shape except for where he had the wound on his neck that we all saw.”She also mentioned a viral video that she claimed showed the moment Charlie Kirk was shot. That video was shared many times on social media, but there is no verified source confirming it shows a real shooting.During episode 242 of her YouTube channel, Candace Owens spoke about a man named Tyler Robinson, who she claimed was wrongly blamed. She said Tyler Robinson drove from Orem to Panguitch, Utah, and stopped at Cowboys Smokehouse on North Main Street. According to her observation, an employee recognized him and contacted authorities.Candace Owens questioned why someone would plan an attack but then use a credit card at a public place. She also claimed federal pressure was placed on Utah authorities. However, there are no official police statements or court records supporting these claims.Since then, Candace Owens has continued to speak about this topic, sharing different theories. Some people support her views, while others strongly criticize them. Even members of Charlie Kirk’s family have publicly asked her to stop spreading these claims.Also Read: “It’s So Stupid It Hurts”: Candace Owens Blasts CIA Narrative After Charlie Kirk Assassination Sparks Fresh Public Outrage","Candace Owens shared what she said was a never-before-seen photo and talked about it during an episode of her show.

Who is Machado?

The rare defiance

Where is Maria Corina Machado?





US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he expected to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who was in hiding during captured president Nicolas Maduro's rule.""I understand she is coming in next week sometime. I look forward to saying hello to her,"" Trump told broadcaster Sean Hannity in an interview on Fox News that aired Thursday night.Machado returned to global focus after Trump on Saturday declared that Venezuela’s long-time leader, Nicolas Maduro, has been “captured” after large-scale American strikes on the South American nation.Hours after the announcement, Machado hailed the capture of Maduro by US forces, declaring that Washington had “fulfilled its promise” and signalling what she described as the beginning of a democratic transition in the country.In a statement, Machado said Maduro would now face “international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations”, adding: “The HOUR OF FREEDOM has arrived!” She argued that Maduro’s refusal to accept a negotiated exit had left the United States with no alternative. “Given his refusal to accept a negotiated exit, the government of the United States has fulfilled its promise to uphold the law,” she said.She insisted the moment vindicated years of opposition struggle. “We have fought for years, we have given everything, and it has been worth it. What had to happen is happening,” Machado said, casting the capture of Maduro as “the hour of the citizens” who, she said, had “risked everything for democracy on 28 July”.Machado had previously voiced strong support for Trump’s aggressive approach toward the Maduro regime and has openly backed external pressure, including military intervention, to end what she describes as communist rule in the country.However, at a press conference hours after the attack, Trump said: “I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader.”“She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.”But Machado said in an appearance earlier this week on the same Fox News program that she wanted to meet with Trump and present him with the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. The US president has openly said he believed he deserved to be honored with the award.“I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe — the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people, want to give it to him and share it with him,” Machado said, according to Bloomberg.Machado emerged as the global face of Venezuela’s opposition after winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025, an honour that Trump himself was also reportedly seeking. Her rise has coincided with Washington’s escalating actions against Caracas, including a US military buildup in the Caribbean, strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats and a blockade on tankers carrying Venezuelan oil.Earlier, Machado travelled to Oslo in Norway, where she received her Nobel Peace Prize. The trip marked her first public appearance after spending more than a year in hiding in Venezuela under constant threat from state authorities.Her departure from the country was itself dramatic. Media reports in the United States said Machado’s escape involved wearing a disguise, including a wig, and travelling from a small Venezuelan fishing village by wooden boat to the Caribbean island of Curacao, before boarding a private plane to Norway. The operation was later described in detail by Bryan Stern, a US special forces veteran and founder of the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, who told the BBC that he led the extraction mission.Stern said the journey, dubbed Operation Golden Dynamite, involved disguises, two boats navigating choppy seas and a flight out of the region.“The seas are very rough. It's pitch black. We're using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary; lots of things can go wrong,” Stern said, adding that the “formidable” Machado did not complain once during the operation.Machado had travelled to Norway in defiance of a decade-long travel ban imposed by Venezuelan authorities. She arrived too late to attend the official Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, with the award being received on her behalf by her daughter.In earlier interviews, Machado has made no secret of her admiration for Trump’s posture toward Caracas. In December, she told CBS News that she was “absolutely” supportive of his strategy.“We, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere,” Machado said about Trump.Machado has long argued that sustained external pressure was the only way to end Maduro’s rule, and Trump’s actions appear to align closely with her long-held stance.Last year, Machado, when she was in Norway, had planned to return to Venezuela regardless of whether Maduro was ultimately removed from power. Her comments came hours after she appeared in public for the first time in 11 months, following her arrival in the Norwegian capital.“I think that the actions of President Trump have been decisive to reach where we are now, where the regime is significantly weaker,” she told reporters. “Because before, the regime thought it had impunity …. Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.”“I would return to Venezuela when we believe the security conditions are right, and it won’t depend on whether or not the regime leaves,” she had said.",Maria Corina Machado hailed the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro by US forces. She said it was the beginning of a democratic transition in the country.

Asmongold’s comments about the Minneapolis shooting fuels controversy







Twitch streamer Zack “Asmongold” has once again made headlines after he shared his opinions about the deadly shooting in Minneapolis. Reports claimed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed a driver during an immigration raid. The incident quickly became a major topic online.According to the Associated Press, the victim was a 37-year-old woman who was shot in the head in front of a family member. On the same day, a short clip from Asmongold’s livestream began circulating on X. In the video, the Texas-based streamer openly defended the officer’s actions. His comments drew heavy criticism, making the situation even more explosive.In the viral clip, Asmongold argued that people calling the incident a murder were wrong. He suggested that the woman should not have been near the officer’s vehicle. He claimed critics would never change their views and said trying to explain the situation was pointless. According to him, authorities should respond with overwhelming force rather than sympathy. He added that after using force, officers should show dominance instead of trying to justify themselves. He insisted that people who oppose such actions are not interested in understanding another point of view.When viewers asked why police did not shoot the car’s tires, Asmongold strongly rejected the idea. He said damaging the tires could make the vehicle dangerous and harm innocent bystanders. He argued that if someone ignores police orders and tries to escape, officers should respond directly. His tone remained aggressive, which further fueled backlash.The controversy grew after political commentator Steven “Destiny” weighed in. Destiny claimed that creators like Asmongold were celebrating the shooting. Asmongold responded on social media by saying the woman was told to exit the car, but instead reversed and tried to run over an officer. He stated that following police instructions is critical and said this context was being ignored. He added that another camera angle made the situation clearer.Tesla CEO Elon Musk also entered the discussion. He backed Asmongold’s stance by saying that when law enforcement orders someone to stop, they must comply. Musk added that using a vehicle as a weapon against an officer justifies self-defense.The incident continues to divide opinions online. While some support Asmongold’s view, many others believe his comments crossed a line.Also Read: Why Zack “Asmongold” comments about white liberal women triggered massive backlash?

Stephen A. Smith questions ICE shooting of Renee Nicole Good while criticizing Kristi Noem’s explanation

Stephen A. Smith is speaking out after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. The longtime ESPN commentator said the ICE agent who fired the shot was likely legally justified, but he also made it clear that the moment raised deep moral questions. Smith said the agent did not have to kill her and could have shot the tires instead. The shooting happened in Minneapolis on Tuesday, January 7. Federal investigators later said the agent acted in self-defense. They claimed Renee Nicole Good tried to hit an ICE agent with her car. That explanation has not ended the debate.On his show, Smith said viewers should not expect charges against the agent. Still, he asked Americans to think about what kind of country they want to live in. His words added fuel to a national conversation already filled with anger, grief, and fear.As details came out, Renee Good’s family also spoke. Her mother described her as kind, loving, and deeply caring. With emotions running high, the case now sits at the center of a larger talk about law enforcement, judgment, and human life.Stephen A. Smith did not hold back when talking about the Minneapolis shooting. From a legal view, he said the agent will likely face no charges.He told viewers, “From a lawful perspective, as it pertains to a law enforcement official, don’t expect him to be prosecuted. He was completely justified.”But Smith quickly shifted his tone. He said being legal does not always mean being right. Smith questioned why deadly force was used when other options may have been possible. He said, “From a humanitarian perspective, however, why did you have to do that? If you could move out of the way, that means you could have shot the tires.”Smith explained his point further. He said Renee Good was not speeding toward the agent. “She wasn’t driving down the road coming at you 90 miles an hour. She was parked in the middle of the street,” he added.Smith also said he did not agree with how DHS Secretary Kristi Noem explained the shooting. He warned that Americans may soon need to ask hard questions about the country they are living in.Renee Nicole Good was 37 years old and lived in Minneapolis. Federal investigators said the shooting was self-defense. They claimed she tried to run over an agent before she was shot.After her name was released, Star Tribune spoke with her mother, Donna Ganger. She said Renee lived with her partner in the Twin Cities. Ganger was told about her daughter’s death on Wednesday, January 8.Ganger also pushed back on claims about protests. She said Renee was not part of any ICE protest. She told the paper, “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known. She was extremely compassionate. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”Renee was once married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., who died in 2023. They shared one child, now six years old. Family members also said Renee had two other children who live with extended family.Also Read: “Darwinism In Full Effect”: Sean Strickland’s Reaction To The ICE Agent's Fatal Shooting Of Renee Nicole Good Ignites Outrage",Stephen A.

US federal agents shot two people in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon, according to police. The incident came a day after a separate shooting in Minneapolis that left a 37-year-old woman dead, further escalating tensions.""Two people are in the hospital following a shooting involving federal agents. We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,"" police chief Bob Day was quoted as saying by Reuters.Portland police confirmed that the shooting on Thursday involved US Border Patrol agents and not Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers (ICE).The agents were carrying out a “targeted vehicle stop” when one agent fired a shot after the driver allegedly attempted to run them over, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said, as cited by the New York Times.The spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said the agents were targeting an immigrant described as being in the country illegally. She alleged that the individual was a member of Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison and has been a frequent focus of US President Donald Trump.No immediate evidence of the alleged gang affiliation was provided.Officials said the shooting occurred sometime after 2.00 pm (local time) near Adventist Health Portland, a hospital and cluster of health clinics in southeast Portland, about eight miles from the city centre.The driver fled the scene after agents fired at the vehicle, and police later found two people with gunshot wounds a short distance away.Emergency medical technicians transported the victims, a man and a woman, to nearby hospitals. Emergency radio communications indicated that both were Spanish speakers. The woman sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, while the man was reported to have suffered two gunshot wounds.At an impromptu news conference near the shooting site, Nathan Vasquez, the district attorney for Multnomah County, which includes Portland, said the FBI and the city’s police department were present at the scene. He declined to specify which agency was leading the investigation.Local leaders called for calm, particularly in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday. “Please keep protests peaceful,” senator Jeff Merkley, D-Ore, said in a statement. “Trump wants to generate riots. Don’t take the bait.”Portland Mayor Keith Wilson issued a statement saying the city is now confronting violence at the hands of federal agents.“We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” the statement read.Wilson urged ICE to suspend all operations in Portland until the investigation is complete.","US federal agents shot two people in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon, according to police.

Greenland Capture To Begin? Karoline Leavitt DISCLOSES Trump’s ‘Final’ Plan: ‘US Troops Rushed...'





As Donald Trump nears one year into his second presidential term, the US has pursued an increasingly aggressive military posture across multiple regions, even as Trump has intermittently spoken of ""peace. "" In a New York Times interview, Trump went further, asserting that his ""own morality"" is the only constraint on his power to order military action anywhere in the world.Trump’s remarks to The New York Times came days after he launched a strong military operation to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, alongside issuing threats against a host of other countries and the autonomous territory of Greenland.“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” Trump told the newspaper when asked whether there were any limits on his global powers.“I don’t need international law,” he added. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”The Republican president then said that “I do” need to abide by international law, but qualified it by adding that “it depends what your definition of international law is.”On China and Taiwan, Trump was asked about President Xi Jinping ’s view of Taiwan as a separatist threat to China. Trump responded, “That’s up to him, what he’s going to be doing. But, you know, I’ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he’ll do that.I hope he doesn’t.”Referring to recent tensions between China and Taiwan, including threats to choke off the island, Trump said he believes the Chinese president would not take such steps while he remains in office. “He may do it after we have a different president, but I don’t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said.Explaining why he felt the United States needed to possess Greenland, Trump told the NYT, “Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document.”Turning to Europe, Trump said, “I think we’ll always get along with Europe, but I want them to shape up. I’m the one that got them to spend more on the, you know, more GDP on Nato. But if you look at Nato, Russia, I can tell you is not at all concerned with any other country but us. I’ve been very loyal to Europe. I’ve done a good job. If it weren’t for me, Russia would have all of Ukraine right now.”The US is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes war crimes, and has repeatedly rejected rulings by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations ’ top judicial body.Trump himself has had multiple run-ins with domestic law. He has been impeached twice, faced a series of federal charges, including conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, which were later dropped after his re-election, and was convicted for covering up a hush money payment to a porn star.Even as he proclaims himself a “peace president” and seeks the Nobel Prize, and so far made open demands about it.Trump has launched a string of military operations during his second term.In June, Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s nuclear program, and over the past year he has overseen strikes on Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, Yemen -- and most recently, Venezuela, taking custody of Maduro.Following Maduro’s capture, a more emboldened Trump has threatened several other countries, including Colombia, as well as Greenland, which is administered by Nato ally Denmark.When asked whether his priority was preserving the Nato military alliance or acquiring Greenland, Trump told the Times: “it may be a choice.”Some members of Congress, including a small number of Republicans, have sought to rein in Trump’s powers.On Thursday, the Senate advanced a measure aimed at limiting presidential military action in Venezuela. However, even if it reaches his desk, Trump would likely veto it.The billionaire president, who built his fortune as a property developer, also said that US ownership of Greenland is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”Trump separately said he had no issue with his family conducting foreign business deals since his return to office.“I prohibited them from doing business in my first term, and I got absolutely no credit for it,” Trump told the daily. “I found out that nobody cared, and I’m allowed to.”","US President Donald Trump says his ""own morality"" is the only constraint on his power to order military action anywhere in the world.

Trump’s ICE Agent KILLS Woman; ‘GET THE F**K OUT!’: Minneapolis EXPLODES After Shock Crackdown





US President Donald Trump on Thursday defended an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent just hours after a 37-year-old woman was shot and killed during a federal operation in Minneapolis.Speaking to reporters, Trump said he did not want to see anyone get shot, but added that he also did not want to see officers being run over. He claimed the woman had tried to drive into the ICE agent.“She behaved horribly,” Trump said. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over,” he said, as quoted by New York Times.When asked whether firing into a vehicle was acceptable, Trump repeated that the situation was “vicious” and asked an aide to pull up surveillance footage on a laptop.As the slow-motion video played, Trump called it “a terrible scene” and said he hated watching it. . “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it,” he said.The woman who was killed was Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US-born citizen. She was sitting inside her car during a large ICE operation when an agent fired multiple shots at close range, killing her.Witnesses told Minnesota Public Radio News that ICE agents gave Good conflicting instructions.Some said she was told to leave the area, while another officer tried to open her car door.As she attempted to move her car away, an agent shot into the vehicle. Several witnesses said they did not see her car hit any officer before shots were fired.Federal officials said the shooting was justified and announced an investigation, but senior Trump administration figures quickly defended the agent’s actions.Local leaders disputed the federal account. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city, while Minnesota governor Tim Walz said the operation showed the risks of aggressive federal enforcement.","The woman who was killed was Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US-born citizen.

Minneapolis: ICE Vehicles Attacked, Protests Erupt After Immigration Agent Kills American Woman

What is happening in Minneapolis?







An ICE officer in its major immigration crackdown fatally shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in South Minneapolis on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator.""The deadly confrontation escalated the intensity of situation in what was already heated-up immigration raid on Minnesota and its immigrants by Donald Trump administration. The administration confirmed the shooting and also informed that the woman was a rioter who in her vehicle attempted to run over law enforcement officers.A video of the incident immediately surfaced widely over social media, showing a Honda SUV apparently blocking unmarked law enforcement vehicles as they attempt to drive down a street that was covered with snow.The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door, prompting one agent to fire three shots as the vehicle pulled off.In the video, an officer is heard ordering the driver to get out of the car and attempting to open the door, after which the driver slowly reverses and then moves forward as if trying to flee. An officer positioned at the front fires three shots, and the SUV travels a short distance at point-blank before crashing into a parked car.The woman was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Minneapolis police chief.Trump, who has ordered nationwide anti-immigration raids, accused the woman of trying to “viciously” run over the agent. Trump reacted to the event, taking to his Truth Social, he wrote: ""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.He further added in the post, ""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""ICE's federal agents have played a central role in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and deportation push, despite objections from some local officials.Last summer, the department of homeland security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment drive to add 10,000 ICE agents to its existing force of about 6,000, drawing criticism that newly deployed officers lacked adequate training.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but described the incident as “domestic terrorism,” alleging that Good had been stalking and obstructing ICE operations throughout the day. She said Good later “weaponized her vehicle.”The incident took place during protests against immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, in the midwestern state of Minnesota.DHS, which oversees ICE, said in a post on X that the woman had attempted to run over an officer, who then fired what it described as ""defensive shots.""The administration deployed hundreds of agents to the city on Wednesday in what officials described as the largest crackdown since a Minnesota welfare fraud case drew national attention. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said he was aware of the shooting involving an ICE agent and called for federal immigration officers to leave the city “immediately.”“The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city,” Frey said in a statement on social media. “We’re demanding ICE leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who withdrew from the governor’s race following the welfare controversy, said his office was working to “gather information on an ICE-related shooting this morning.”","US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator"" The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126405732,imgsize-1181996,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Japan’s nuclear safety regulator has reported the loss of a work-issued smartphone containing highly sensitive contact details after an employee misplaced the device during a personal trip to China, according to Japanese media and international news agencies, raising fresh questions about security practices within the country’s nuclear oversight system.According to AFP, the phone belonged to an employee of the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) and contained confidential names and contact details of staff responsible for nuclear security. Such information is not made public due to the sensitive nature of their work.An NRA official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that the smartphone was issued for use during disasters such as major earthquakes and was primarily used for calls and text messages. The official said the device did not provide access to nuclear facility data.The incident was reported in November to Japan’s Personal Information Protection Commission, which oversees the handling of personal data. Citing unnamed sources, Kyodo News reported that the phone was likely lost on November 3 while the employee was removing items from carry-on luggage during a security check at an airport in Shanghai.The loss was noticed three days later, but the device could not be recovered despite inquiries with airport authorities.Kyodo also reported that remotely locking or erasing the data on the phone was not possible because the device was out of range.Major Japanese media, including the Asahi Shimbun, said the phone contained contact details of personnel in the NRA’s nuclear security division, which is responsible for protecting nuclear materials from threats such as terrorism and theft. “As a rule, the identities and direct contact details of personnel involved in nuclear security are kept confidential to minimize security risks,” the Japan Times reported.AFP noted that China has been increasing pressure on Tokyo following comments by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in November suggesting Japan may respond militarily if Taiwan were attacked. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force. The disclosure also comes as Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) moves to restart the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, the world’s largest, later this month. The NRA is currently evaluating TEPCO’s application, AFP reported.Japan shut down all nuclear reactors following the 2011 Fukushima disaster triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami. However, the resource-poor country is now seeking to revive nuclear energy to cut reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet rising power demand, including from artificial intelligence, according to AFP.",The phone belonged to an employee of the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) It contained confidential names and contact details of staff responsible for nuclear security.

Minneapolis: ICE Vehicles Attacked, Protests Erupt After Immigration Agent Kills American Woman

Who was Renee Nicole Good ?





A woman was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent during the crackdown operation in south Minneapolis on Wednesday.Officials said the shooting occurred amid a tense confrontation as unmarked law enforcement vehicles moved through a residential neighbourhood during the operation.Video footage circulating online showed officers ordering the woman, who was driving an SUV, to get out of the vehicle and attempting to open her door. As the vehicle moved, an ICE agent fired three shots. The SUV then travelled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.The woman was taken to Hennepin County Medical Centre, where she was pronounced dead, according to Minneapolis police. The Department of Homeland Security said the agent acted in self-defence after the woman attempted to run over officers, a claim disputed by city leaders and civil rights groups, who have called the killing preventable and demanded an independent investigation.The incident quickly drew national attention and triggered protests across Minneapolis. Hundreds of people gathered near the site of the shooting and later attended a vigil. Mayor Jacob Frey urged federal immigration officers to leave the city, stating that their presence was “causing chaos” and putting residents at risk.The woman killed in the shooting was identified as Renee Nicole Good. She is a 37-year-old poet and writer who lived just a few blocks from where she was shot.Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the family was informed of her death late Wednesday morning.“That’s so stupid that she was killed,” Ganger said, after learning some of the circumstances from a reporter. “She was probably terrified.”Ganger said her daughter lived in the Twin Cities with her partner and was not involved in violent activity or efforts to obstruct ICE agents.“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” she said. “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”Good was the mother of a six-year-old child and also had two other children who, according to family members, lived with extended relatives.She had previously been married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr, who died in 2023. Macklin’s father said he was shocked by the news and expressed concern for his grandchild. “There’s nobody else in his life,” he said. “I’ll drive. I’ll fly. To come and get my grandchild.”The Instagram account of Good described her as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” from Colorado who was “experiencing Minneapolis,” according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.In 2020, while studying creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia, she received the university’s undergraduate poetry prize. A brief biography posted by the university described her as someone who loved writing, reading and making art.Friends, neighbours and community leaders remembered Good as a caring and peaceful presence. At a vigil attended by hundreds, speakers described her as a good neighbour who was trying to look out for others.“She was peaceful, she did the right thing,” said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN. “She died because she loved her neighbours.”","Renee Nicole Good, 37, was fatally shot by an ICE agent during a crackdown operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

‘Will Shoot First, Ask Later’: NATO Troops ‘Ready For War’ If Trump Orders Greenland Invasion |Watch

Europe scrambles to push back

'$10,000 to $100,000 per person'





Denmark has warned that its troops are under standing orders to ""shoot first and ask questions later"" if Greenland comes under attack, as anxiety grows in Europe over the United States under President Donald Trump openly weighing military action to seize the Arctic territory.The country's defence ministry said a Cold War-era rule obliges soldiers to respond immediately to any foreign invasion without waiting for political clearance or formal orders. Speaking to Danish newspaper Berlingske, the ministry said the directive requires forces to ""immediately take up the fight"" if attacked and remains fully in force.The rule, introduced in 1952, states that in the event of an invasion, troops must act “without waiting for or seeking orders, even if the commanders in question are not aware of the declaration of war or state of war”. Danish officials said the provision applies regardless of who the invading force may be.The warning comes as European leaders struggle to frame a response to repeated statements by Trump, who has refused to rule out the use of force to annex Greenland. The White House has said Trump is still considering all options, heightening unease among Denmark’s allies.European governments have rallied behind Copenhagen, with calls for a coordinated response to any US move against Greenland.French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he would discuss the issue with his German and Polish counterparts, emphasising the need for collective action.“We want to take action, but we want to do so together with our European partners,” Barrot told France Inter radio.He added that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “discarded” the idea that Greenland could face an intervention similar to the recent US assault on Venezuela aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro. Despite those assurances, Denmark’s reaffirmation of its shoot-first doctrine underscores how seriously it is preparing for the possibility of escalation.The Trump administration is considering a plan to offer direct cash payments to Greenlanders in an effort to persuade them to break away from Denmark and move closer to the United States, according to multiple sources cited by news agency Reuters.US officials have talked internally about offering lump sum payments of between $10,000 and $100,000 per person to residents of Greenland. The island nation is currently a semi-autonomous Danish territory with a population of about 57,000 and has an abundance of useful natural resources. The idea remains at a preliminary stage and details are still unclear. Aides have discussed figures that could amount to nearly $6 billion in total, sources said.Another option being discussed is a Compact of Free Association, an agreement the US already has with some Pacific island nations. Under such deals, the US provides financial aid and defence protection in return for military access. Greenland would likely have to become independent from Denmark first, and payments could be used to encourage public support for that step or for a future agreement.Polls show most Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark, but surveys also indicate they do not want to become part of the United States.",Denmark warns troops to'shoot first and ask questions later' if Greenland comes under attack.

'Unlawful actions': Russia accuses US of forceful seizure of vessel; calls it maritime law breach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unlawful-actions-russia-accuses-us-of-forceful-seizure-of-vessel-calls-it-maritime-law-breach/articleshow/126425650.cms,"AP image

The Transport ministry also condemns seizure

How did the US seize the tanker?





Russia’s foreign ministry has accused the United States of “unlawful actions” after US forces seized the Russian-flagged oil tanker Marinera in international waters. Moscow said the seizure violates international maritime law and risks further escalating already strained Russia–US relations.In an official statement issued on Thursday, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called on Washington to respect established principles of international maritime law and immediately halt actions against the Marinera and other civilian vessels operating on the high seas. This comes after US forces seized the tanker on January 7.The statement read, “Alongside the US administration's disregard for the accepted norms of international maritime navigation, Washington's readiness to provoke acute international crises, including in Russian-American relations, which are already severely strained, is both regrettable and alarming.”According to the ministry, the incident involving the Marinera could lead to a further escalation of military and political tensions in the Euro-Atlantic region and lower the threshold for the use of force against civilian shipping.“The Marinera incident can only lead to a further escalation of military-political tensions in the Euro-Atlantic region and a dangerous lowering of the threshold for using force against civilian shipping.Encouraged by Washington's irresponsible example, other actors may feel emboldened to take similar actions.”The ministry also accused the United Kingdom of involvement, claiming British authorities had openly acknowledged their role in the US military operation in North Atlantic waters.Russia maintained that the Marinera, formerly known as Bella 1, had been temporarily authorised to sail under the Russian flag on December 24, in accordance with both Russian and international law. The vessel, it said, was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Atlantic en route to a Russian port.The ministry stressed that US authorities had been repeatedly informed of the tanker’s legal status and civilian nature. “There could have been no doubt regarding this fact, nor any basis for alleging that the tanker was sailing ‘without a flag’ or ‘under a false flag’,” the statement said.Citing international maritime law, Russia argued that only the flag state has jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas.“International maritime law explicitly grants the flag state exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas. Stopping and inspecting a vessel in international waters is permitted only under narrowly defined circumstances, such as suspected piracy or slave trading - neither of which apply to the Marinera. In all other cases, such actions require the consent of the flag state, which in this instance is Russia,” the statement further read.The ministry added that Russia had refused to grant consent and had formally protested to US authorities in recent weeks over the continued pursuit of the vessel by a US Coast Guard ship.Under these circumstances, the ministry said, “the boarding and de facto seizure of a civilian vessel on the high seas by US military personnel, along with the detention of its crew, can only be viewed as a gross violation of fundamental principles and norms of international maritime law and the freedom of navigation.”Russia also raised concerns about the safety of the crew, which includes citizens of several countries, and warned of environmental risks due to the seizure being carried out in severe weather conditions.Rejecting US references to domestic sanctions laws, the Russian foreign ministry said unilateral sanctions imposed by Washington and its allies have no legal foundation under international law and cannot justify the seizure of vessels on the high seas.“Suggestions from certain US officials that the seizure of the Marinera is part of a broader strategy to establish Washington's unlimited control over Venezuela's natural resources are profoundly cynical. We categorically reject such neo-colonial ambitions,” the statement added.In a post on social media platform X, the ministry wrote: “We call on Washington to immediately cease its unlawful actions against the Marinera and other vessels engaged in lawful activities on the high seas. We reiterate our demand that the US ensure appropriate treatment of the Russian citizens on board.”Russia’s transport ministry on Wednesday said that the US had no legal right to use force against a vessel lawfully registered under another country’s jurisdiction.In a statement posted on Telegram, the ministry said the Marinera was boarded by US naval forces in international waters, after which contact with the ship was lost.“In accordance with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation applies in high seas waters, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered in the jurisdictions of other states,” the statement read.The seizure followed a weeks-long pursuit by the US Coast Guard. The tanker, originally called Bella 1, had been sanctioned by the US in 2024 for operating as part of a so-called “shadow fleet” transporting illicit oil linked to Iran and Venezuela.Last month, US authorities attempted to seize the vessel while it was operating under the Guyana flag and heading toward Venezuela. The crew refused boarding and abruptly changed course into the Atlantic. The ship was later renamed Marinera and re-registered under the Russian flag.According to US officials, military assets were repositioned to the UK ahead of the operation. The tanker was eventually seized around 190 miles south of Iceland in the North Atlantic Ocean.US European Command said the operation was carried out under a federal court warrant for violations of US sanctions, with support from multiple US agencies. UK defence officials confirmed they assisted the US following a request for help.","US forces seized the Russian-flagged oil tanker Marinera in international waters on January 7.

A street in the US state of Michigan has been renamed in honour of late Begum Khaleda Zia, the three-time former prime minister of Bangladesh and chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).The Hamtramck City Council has approved a proposal to rename a section of Carpenter Street, between Joseph Campau Avenue and Conant Street, in recognition of Khaleda Zia.Four councillors of Bangladeshi origin currently serve on the Hamtramck City Council and played a key role in securing approval for the street renaming, the BNP said through a post on social media.Members of the expatriate community said the move goes beyond a symbolic change of name, describing it as international recognition of Bangladesh’s political struggle, as cited by BSS News.The community also noted that this is not the first instance of a street in the United States being named after a Bangladeshi leader. Earlier, a street in Chicago was named in memory of martyred Bangladeshi President Ziaur Rahman Hamtramck has the highest proportion of immigrants in Michigan, the state’s largest Bangladeshi immigrant community and the second-highest concentration of Arab residents after Dearborn.Over the past three decades, the city has become a key destination for Arab and Asian immigrants, particularly from Yemen and Bangladesh.Census data show that more than 40 per cent of Hamtramck’s population is foreign-born, while nearly 70 per cent of residents are Muslim, including the mayor, the police chief and all members of the city council, according to the Detroit Free Press.","The Hamtramck City Council has approved a proposal to rename a section of Carpenter Street, between Joseph Campau Avenue and Conant Street.

Senate pushes back on Trump's military threats against Venezuela with war powers vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-pushes-back-on-trumps-military-threats-against-venezuela-with-war-powers-vote/articleshow/126425302.cms,".





WASHINGTON: The Senate advanced a resolution Thursday that would limit President Donald Trump's ability to conduct further attacks against Venezuela, sounding a note of disapproval for his expanding ambitions in the Western Hemisphere.Democrats and five Republicans voted to advance the war powers resolution on a 52-47 vote and ensure a vote next week on final passage. It has virtually no chance of becoming law because Trump would have to sign it if it were to pass the Republican-controlled House. Still, it was a significant gesture that showed unease among some Republicans after the US military seized Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid over the weekend.Trump's administration is now seeking to control Venezuela's oil resources and its government, but the war powers resolution would require congressional approval for any further attacks on the South American country.""To me, this is all about going forward,"" said Missouri Sen Josh Hawley, one of the five Republican votes. ""If the president should determine, 'You know what? I need to put troops on the ground of Venezuela,' I think that would require Congress to weigh in.""The other Republicans who backed the resolution were Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Todd Young of Indiana.Trump reacted to their votes by saying on social media that they ""should never be elected to office again"" and that the vote ""greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security.""Democrats had failed to pass several such resolutions in the months that Trump escalated his campaign against Venezuela. But lawmakers argued now that Trump has captured Maduro and set his sights to other conquests such as Greenland, the vote presents Congress with an opportunity.""This wasn't just a procedural vote. It's a clear rejection of the idea that one person can unilaterally send American sons and daughters into harm's way without Congress, without debate,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.Lawmakers' response to the Venezuela operation Republican leaders have said they had no advance notification of the raid early morning Saturday to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, but mostly expressed satisfaction this week as top administration officials provided classified briefings on the operation.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who forced the vote on the resolution, said he believes many Republicans were caught off guard by the outcome. He said that Trump's recent comments to The New York Times suggesting U.S. oversight in Venezuela could last for years - combined with details revealed in the classified briefings - prompted some lawmakers to conclude that ""this is too big to let a president do it without Congress.""The administration has used an evolving set of legal justifications for the monthslong campaign in Central and South America, from destroying alleged drug boats under authorizations for the global fight against terrorism to seizing Maduro in what was ostensibly a law enforcement operation to put him on trial in the United States.Republican leaders have backed Trump.""I think the president has demonstrated at least already a very strong commitment to peace through strength, especially in this hemisphere,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. ""I think Venezuela got that message loudly and clearly.""A vote on a similar resolution in November narrowly failed to gain the majority needed. Paul and Murkowski were the only Republicans voting in favor then.Young in a statement said he supported the operation to capture Maduro, but was concerned by Trump's statements that his administration now ""runs"" Venezuela.""It is unclear if that means that an American military presence will be required to stabilize the country,"" Young said, adding that he believed most of his constituents were not prepared to send U.S. troops to that mission.House Democrats were introducing a similar resolution Thursday.The rarely enforced War Powers Act Trump criticized the Senate vote as ""impeding the President's Authority as Commander in Chief"" under the Constitution.Presidents of both parties have long argued the War Powers Act infringes on their authority. Passed in 1973 in the aftermath of the Vietnam War - and over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon - it has never succeeded in directly forcing a president to halt military action.Congress declares war while the president serves as commander in chief, according to the Constitution. But lawmakers have not formally declared war since World War II, granting presidents broad latitude to act unilaterally. The law requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces and to end military action within 60 to 90 days absent authorization - limits that presidents of both parties have routinely stretched.Democrats argue those limits are being pushed further than ever. Some Republicans have gone further still, contending congressional approval is unnecessary altogether.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally who traveled with the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday, said he would be comfortable with Trump taking over other countries without congressional approval, including Greenland.""The commander in chief is the commander in chief. They can use military force,"" Graham said.Greenland may further test the limits Graham's comments come as the administration weighs not only its next steps in Venezuela, but also Greenland. The White House has said the ""military is always an option"" when it comes to a potential American takeover of the world's largest island.Republicans have cited Greenland's strategic value, but most have balked at the idea of using the military to take the country. Some favor a potential deal to purchase the country, while others have acknowledged that is an unlikely option when Denmark and Greenland have rejected Trump's overtures.Democrats want to get out in front of any military action and are already preparing to respond. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego said he expected soon to introduce a resolution ""to block Trump from invading Greenland.""Greenland belongs to a NATO ally, Denmark, which has prompted a much different response from Republican senators than the situation in Venezuela.On Thursday, Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, met with the Danish ambassador to the United States, Jesper Moller Sorensen. Also in the meeting were the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and the head of Greenland's representation to the U.S. and Canada, Jacob Isbosethsen.""There's no willingness on their part to negotiate for the purchase or the change in title to their land which they've had for so long,"" Wicker, R-Miss., said afterward. ""That's their prerogative and their right.""Wicker added that he hoped an agreement could be reached that would strengthen the U.S. relationship with Denmark.""Greenland is not for sale,"" Isbosethsen told reporters.","Democrats and five Republicans voted to advance the war powers resolution on a 52-47 vote.
