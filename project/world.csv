During a rally in Arizona on Thursday, Trump not only reiterated his false accusations that immigrants are stealing and consuming pets but also added geese to the mix.“Haitian immigrants have descended upon Springfield, Ohio, and are destroying their way of life,” Trump told the crowd.“A recording of 911 calls shows residents reporting that the migrants are walking off with the town’s geese. They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake. And even walking off with their pets.”However, the actual disruption in Springfield came from a bomb threat at City Hall, which led to early school closures and evacuations. According to The Haitian Times, the local Haitian community is facing property damage and heightened safety concerns, unrelated to Trump's sensational claims.Contrary to Trump's narrative, a local Springfield CEO recently praised Haitian immigrants as hard-working and reliable. The narrative about geese, based on a single 911 call, has been widely discredited.Trump’s rally speech also took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting without evidence that her events draw “zero” attendees. This claim came as Harris spoke to a crowd of about 17,000 in North Carolina’s Greensboro Coliseum, according to her campaign.Additionally, Trump made an unusual pivot to discussing voter demographics, hinting that he might blame older voters if he loses the election. “My audiences, they’ve gotten younger and younger,” he observed. “Don’t worry, I still like the old people the best. I don’t care!” He added that he remains loyal to his longtime supporters despite the shifting crowd dynamics.","Former President Donald Trump claimed that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating geese in Springfield, Ohio.

Debate fallout: Trump accuses ABC News of bias as Harris campaign pushes for rematch; Mark Penn calls for investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/debate-fallout-trump-accuses-abc-news-of-bias-as-harris-campaign-pushes-for-rematch-mark-penn-calls-for-investigation/articleshow/113306638.cms,"In the wake of a contentious debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, controversy has erupted. Critics from Trump's camp are alleging bias on the part of ABC News , suggesting that Harris may have received debate questions in advance. Moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate has faced scrutiny from Trump and his allies, who argue that the moderators were unfairly critical of the former president and showed favoritism towards Harris.Mark Penn , former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton, has also called for an internal investigation by ABC News into the perceived bias of the debate moderators.Penn suggested an independent review of the moderators' texts and emails to determine if there was any effort to ""rig the outcome"" of the debate. He criticised the media coverage as ""laughable"" and highlighted the need for impartiality in future debates.Further scrutiny has been directed at the relationship between Harris and ABC News. ABC News journalist Linsey Davis, a co-moderator and member of the same sorority as Harris, has faced criticism for potential bias. Additionally, connections between Harris and Dana Walden, co-chairman of Disney (which oversees ABC News), have raised questions about impartiality. The New York Times reported that Walden and Harris are neighbors and that Walden has donated to Harris’s political campaigns.The drama intensified with claims from a MAGA supporter on X (formerly Twitter), who alleged an ABC whistleblower would reveal an affidavit about the debate. Conservative accounts, boasting over a million followers combined, echoed these claims, accusing the Harris campaign of having prior knowledge of the questions and the moderators of promising to ""fact-check"" Trump.In response, Harris' campaign has challenged Trump to a rematch, with Fox News offering to host. Trump has declined, asserting in a Truth Social post that Harris' push for another debate signifies his victory in their first encounter. Harris, however, emphasized the importance of another debate, stating, “I believe we owe it to voters to meet again.”Political commentators, including Doug Schoen and Noah Pollak, have criticized the moderators for their handling of the debate, with accusations of one-sided fact-checking and bias. Despite the fallout, Trump's reluctance to agree to another debate suggests that the initial confrontation may be the only opportunity for voters to see the candidates face off before the November election.The debate, drawing over 67 million viewers, was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Harris. It followed a tumultuous period for Trump, whose previous debate against Biden had led to calls for his exit from the race. With Biden's withdrawal and Harris's endorsement as his successor, the stakes were high.","Critics from Trump's camp are alleging bias on the part of ABC News.

Case against British Indian woman for Hindu prayers on beach collapses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/case-against-british-indian-woman-for-hindu-prayers-on-beach-collapses/articleshow/113240340.cms,"BRIGHTON: An Indian-origin woman and her husband are celebrating after charges that would have criminalised her Hindu prayers on the beach were thrown out of court.Sheila Jacklin (61), a British Telugu designer born to parents from Andhra Pradesh, was charged with harassment for chanting Sanskrit mantras and performing mudra gestures on the beach near her home in Normans Bay, a remote hamlet near Brighton, after neighbours who bought a second home next to them in 2014 said the gestures were offensive and made around 100 complaints to police.Sheila’s husband Nigel Jacklin (62), a statistician, was charged with assault and harassment. A three-day trial was scheduled to start on Tuesday at Brighton magistrates’ court.However, on the first day the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) applied to get the case adjourned. This was refused by the magistrates. The prosecution then offered no evidence and the trial collapsed. The couple were told by the magistrates they were ""free to go.""It was the second time a harassment case against Sheila over her Hindu prayers on the beach had reached court. The trial had collapsed the first time in 2019 too. On both occasions complaints were made by Stephane Duckett and his American partner Norinne Betjemann, who converted a workshop next to the Jacklins in 2014.The couple were charged this time with pursuing a course of conduct amounting to harassment against Betjemann by staring into her property, loitering, and intimidating behaviour which caused distress. They both denied all the charges against them.“I have been praying on the beach all over the world since the 1980s. I am a hippy. I am not interested in looking at my neighbour’s house,” Sheila told TOI outside court.She said she had been doing Hindu prayers on the beach for 22 years before the couple moved next door, pointing out there was no temple nearby and it was common to do Hindu prayers in the open air. She said it was important to practice in the same “ashram”. “To conflate one of the many mudras with an offensive gesture is a serious insult to Hinduism,” she said, referring to one complaint that her Aakash mudra was an “offensive” V-sign.“I should have the right to practise my religion freely in the UK. The idea I was going to be taken to court for harassment for praying is absurd,” she said.Nigel added: “We feel this is racist and Hinduphobic.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We requested an adjournment in this case in order to discharge our disclosure obligations following late submissions by the defence. Unfortunately, this request was refused by the court and we were regrettably left with no option but to offer no evidence.”However Nigel said the defence submissions were submitted on time and were not late.A Sussex Police spokesperson said they “conducted a thorough, impartial investigation into multiple reports of harassment, and one reported assault”. It said “enquiries were conducted without prejudice” and both suspects were interviewed. “Evidence was submitted to the CPS, which approved charges of harassment and assault by battery, before no evidence was offered after magistrates declined a request for adjournment from the CPS,”Sussex police said, adding it would continue to do all it could “to protect our communities and secure justice for victims of crime”.","Sheila Jacklin was charged with harassment for chanting Sanskrit mantras and performing mudra gestures on the beach near her home in Normans Bay, a remote hamlet near Brighton.

How quick action by Alaska Airlines pilot prevented near-collision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/quick-action-by-alaska-airlines-pilot-prevents-near-collision-with-southwest/articleshow/113306902.cms,"Alaska Airlines plane aborts takeoff to avoid potential collision

An Alaska Airlines jet on Thursday was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.Alaska Airlines confirmed that their pilots spotted ""a potential traffic conflict on the runway"" and applied the brakes immediately to prevent the situation from getting worse. No injuries were reported, but the extreme heat from the sudden stop caused the tires on the Boeing 737 Max , scheduled to depart for Seattle, to go flat.The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) is investigating the incident at the Nashville International Airport which occurred at around 9.15 am (ET), according to Chair Jennifer Homendy. ""We are clearly very concerned about this (incident) and others we are investigating,"" Homendy told reporters.The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) is also looking into the incident, which involved Southwest Airlines Flight 2029, a Boeing 737-700 , that had been cleared to cross the end of the same runway as an Alaska Airlines plane, as reported by AP.The Alaska Airlines flight was carrying 176 passengers and six crew members. The airline arranged for another plane to transport the passengers to Seattle by Thursday night while inspecting the affected aircraft. Alaska Airlines expressed gratitude for the pilots' quick response, saying, ""We’re grateful for the expertise of our pilots who immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating.""According to tracking website Flightradar24, the Alaska plane was traveling at a speed of 104 knots (120 mph, 193 km per hour) on the runway before slowing down.Southwest stated that they are in contact with the NTSB and FAA and will cooperate with the investigation. Alaska Airlines reported that maintenance technicians in Nashville are currently inspecting the aircraft involved in the incident.There have been several close calls, or ""runway incursions,"" in recent years, raising concerns about the safety of US air travel. NTSB chair Homendy had mentioned last November that while these incidents are ""incredibly rare"" compared to the number of flights, they indicate the aviation system is under stress.Recent incidents include a close call in Austin, Texas, where a FedEx jet flew over a Southwest jet taking off in foggy conditions, and a collision between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway in Atlanta. No injuries were reported in these incidents.Alaska Airlines also made headlines in January when one of the door panels blew out on a plane flying from Portland and bound for Ontario. The plane's pilot first Officer Emily Wiprud on Thursday recalled her experience of operating the flight. Her initial indication of the unfolding crisis was a deafening blast that reverberated in her ears, accompanied by a sudden rush of air. The severity of the situation was immediately apparent to her, although the presence of a breach in the aircraft's fuselage remained unknown until the plane touched down.""I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,"" Wiprud said. ""I knew something was catastrophically wrong."" Further complicating matters, her headset, along with the phones of two passengers and various airplane parts, had been forcibly ejected from the aircraft during the incident.","An Alaska Airlines jet was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.

Harris, on the other hand, called for a second debate against Trump, saying ""we owe it to the voters.""Following their heated televised debate earlier this week, Trump took to social media to declare himself the winner, dismissing Harris' call for another face-off.He said: ""THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!"", referring to the recent face-off with Harris and a previous debate with Joe Biden in June, which had pushed Biden out of the race.""When a prize fighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are 'I want a rematch',"" Trump wrote.Trump boasted about his performance, stating, ""Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris,"" despite snap polls suggesting Harris performed better in front of an audience of over 67 million viewers.In response, Harris reiterated her commitment to transparency. “This election and what is at stake could not be more important,” she told the Charlotte crowd, stressing that voters need another chance to compare her vision of the future with Trump’s policies.She urged for another debate during a rally in North Carolina saying voters “deserve another debate” to see the candidates clearly.""Two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate, and I believe we owe it to the voters to have another,"" she said, emphasizing the importance of the upcoming election.The two candidates faced off in a heated debate in Philadelphia earlier this week, hosted by ABC News. While both sides claimed victory, polling suggests Harris may have gained the upper hand. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after the debate shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42% among registered voters—a five-point margin that slightly increased from her previous four-point lead in August.However, the polls don’t entirely back up Trump's claims. According to the Reuters poll, 53% of voters thought Harris won the debate, compared to just 24% who believed Trump performed better. A CNN flash poll showed similar results, with 60% of respondents favoring Harris’ performance.The post-debate polls, along with Harris' increased national support, reflect her growing momentum. In addition to the Reuters poll, a CNN poll found that about 52% of voters felt Trump faltered during the debate, leading to a stronger showing for Harris.While Harris continues to push for a second debate, it remains uncertain if Trump will reconsider. The vice presidential debate between GOP Senator JD Vance and Democratic Governor Tim Walz is still on the calendar for October 1, but for now, the Harris-Trump debate saga seems paused.","Former President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he would not participate in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.

Los Angeles hit by dozens of aftershocks from 4.7 Malibu earthquake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-hit-by-dozens-of-aftershocks-from-4-7-malibu-earthquake/articleshow/113306290.cms,"Hours after an earthquake of 4.7 magnitude rattled the Los Angeles area on Thursday morning, aftershocks were reported the following day.After the initial quake hit the area, over two dozen aftershocks, including two of magnitude 3.4, were felt with more aftershocks possible in the hours and days ahead, AP news agency reported.The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centred 4 miles (7 km) north of Malibu and was about 7 miles (11 km) below the surface.The quake happened as the region has been dealing with three major wildfires burning east of Los Angeles that torched dozens of homes and forced thousands to evacuate. The blazes erupted during a blistering heat wave that has just subsided.The earthquake's epicentre was closest to the Malibu fault, but also in proximity to the Anacapa fault, as stated by Lucy Jones, a seismologist from the California Institute of Technology. Earthquakes with magnitudes below 5.0 are too small to be conclusively linked to large faults that are mapped at the earth's surface.""It's a garden-variety Southern California earthquake,"" Jones said.The 115-year-old Santa Monica Pier, located approximately 12 miles (19 km) from Malibu, experienced several seconds of intense shaking during the quake, as captured by a live camera. Several morning newscasts also recorded the earthquake live as cameras shook in television studios.KTLA-TV reported that a crew was working on clearing large boulders that had rolled onto Malibu Canyon Road, near the epicentre.Bruce Silverstein, a Malibu Councilmember who has lived in the community for 13 years, described this quake as the hardest yet, but noted that nothing broke, reported AP news agency.""Our house shook for about two or three seconds. I was concerned the windows were going to pop,"" Silverstein said.At The Country Kitchen breakfast place in Malibu, manager Rene Vasquez said the shaking lasted a few seconds and kitchen staff ducked outside as a precaution.""It wasn't that bad,"" Vasquez said. ""Thank God nothing fell.""Several celebrities and other people took to social media to post that the jolt awakened them.Hotel heiress and media personality Paris Hilton wrote on X, ""That #Earthquake was scary."" Reality TV star Khloe Kardashian posted: ""Damn that was a big one.""Some residents reported being alerted by the state's earthquake early warning system.","4.7 magnitude earthquake rattled Los Angeles area on Thursday morning.

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?” her team asked in a pointed post-debate statement.Trump, meanwhile, has wavered on whether he’s game for another debate, calling the push for a second round a sign of desperation from the Harris camp. However, he’s left the door open depending on the host network.As the dust settles, the next major clash will be between the vice presidential nominees—Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—who are scheduled to debate on October 1, setting the stage for yet another high-stakes political face-off.","A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump.

Georgia Judge dismisses two charges in Trump's election case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-judge-dismisses-two-charges-in-trumps-election-case/articleshow/113303050.cms,"A Georgia judge on Thursday dismissed two criminal charges against former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election interference case. Additionally, a separate count targeting Trump’s allies was removed. Despite these dismissals, the core charges, including racketeering, remain in place.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled that prosecutors had exceeded their authority by bringing charges related to filing false documents in federal court.Specifically, the charges of conspiracy to commit filing false documents and filing false documents against Trump were dismissed. A third charge, targeting Trump's allies for criminal attempts to file false documents, was also quashed. McAfee's decision was influenced by a 19th-century Supreme Court ruling that prevents states from prosecuting perjury or false filings in federal court.While some charges have been dropped, Trump still faces eight remaining counts, with the racketeering charge being a major component of the case. The accusations involve an alleged effort by Trump and his co-defendants to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia as part of a broader attempt to challenge the election results. Both Trump and 14 others have pleaded not guilty.The legal proceedings have been delayed as Trump's team appeals Judge McAfee’s decision to keep Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as the lead prosecutor. Oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for December, and the case is unlikely to progress before the 2024 election. Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, praised the ruling, asserting that Trump and his team had ""prevailed once again,"" according to the New York Post.","A Georgia judge on Thursday dismissed two criminal charges against former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election interference case.

In some cases, their houses and families have been targeted.This is the first instance in Pakistan of uniformed personnel on a sit-in and blocking an inter-provincial highway for four consecutive days.

Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.
