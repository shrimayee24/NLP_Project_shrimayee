'White collar terror module': ED raids Al-Falah University; searches at 25 locations across Delhi-NCR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-car-blast-central-agency-raids-al-falah-university-in-faridabad-probe-intensifies/articleshow/125399642.cms,"Multiple IEDs, 32 Vehicles: Agencies Uncover Plan For Serial Car Explosions In Delhi Blast Probe

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate launched raids against the Al-Falah University in Faridabad along with its office in Okhla and the university's promoters on Tuesday morning, PTI reported citing sources. Initial probe reveal discrepancies regarding UGC and NAAC recognition.The central agency has been conducting raids since 5am at 25 different places across the national capital, intensifying the Delhi car blast probe, ANI reported citing sources.Nine shell firms connected to the group, each registered at the same address, are now under scrutiny. Preliminary inquiries have revealed several red flags typical of shell operations, such as: no actual office space or noticeable utility usage at their listed locations; the same phone number and email ID being used for multiple companies and accounts; no EPFO or ESIC filings despite the scale of business they claim; repeated overlap in directors or authorised signatories with poor KYC documentation; very limited salary payments made through formal banking channels and no HR records; and a pattern of companies being incorporated in a coordinated manner using identical contact details, the news agency reported.The investigation focuses on a “white-collar” terror network that appears to involve both medical professionals and individuals connected to the university. Authorities have recovered key evidence, including a vehicle tied to the blast and significant amounts of explosive material, pointing to a deeper, more organised operation.This comes a day after the brother of the Al-Falah University chancellor was arrested from Hyderabad in connection with 25-year-old fraud cases.Al Falah University has come under scrutiny after the arrest of several doctors in connection with the November 10 high-intensity blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, which killed 13 people and injured many others.The prime accused, Dr Umar Un Nabi, was a former student of the university. In response, the institution issued a statement condemning the attack and affirming its commitment as a responsible educational body aligned with national interests.As part of the investigation, Delhi Police have issued two summons to the university’s chancellor, citing the need to resolve inconsistencies in the institution’s functioning and clarify the roles of certain individuals linked to it.Investigators are probing possible connections between the university and multiple suspects associated with the blast, including examining institutional records, financial transactions, and administrative decisions as part of a broader inquiry into the alleged Faridabad terror module.","The Enforcement Directorate launched raids against the Al-Falah University in Faridabad along with its office in Okhla.

Telangana govt to send team to Saudi to coordinate relief

Eighteen members of a family were among at least 45 Umrah pilgrims from Hyderabad charred early Monday in a bus inferno triggered by a highway collision with a fuel tanker while travelling from Mecca to Medina in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed Shoeb, the lone pilgrim to survive, escaped because he was seated beside the driver when the bus burst into flames after ramming into the tanker around 1.30am (11pm IST). Both men broke through a window and jumped.Hyderabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the 46 passengers were part of a 54-member group that flew from the city to Saudi Arabia on Nov 9. They were to return on Nov 23 after visiting Islam's holiest site. ""Four members of the group hired a car to travel to Medina after completing Umrah rituals. Another four stayed back in Mecca,"" Sajjanar said.The victims include 22 women and 11 children. Shoeb, whose brother also travelled to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage but wasn't on the bus, remains in intensive care at Saudi German Hospital with injuries to his arms and legs.""I spoke to Shoeb. Going by what he said, some passengers were asleep during the crash.He was lucky to be in the cabin with the driver,"" his sibling, Mohammed Sameer, told TOI over phone.""It is unclear if the tanker hit the vehicle while it was moving or was stationary.”Sameer and his family landed in Jeddah three days after the rest of the pilgrims and are yet to finish their Mecca rituals.

Announcing ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of those who died, the govt said it would help arrange the funerals of the deceased in Saudi in accordance with traditions. Two members of each affected family would be flown to Saudi, it said. “The bodies were charred beyond recognition. DNA tests are also likely to be conducted to identify the victims,” said Azharuddin, adding a control room had been set up at Haj House (numbers 79979 59754/99129 19545) to provide more information to families of victims. The minister reaffirmed the state govt, in coordination with the foreign ministry and Saudi authorities, was making all possible efforts to provide assistance, guidance, and necessary support to the families. Police and govt officials, who are in contact with authorities in Saudi, said the Al-Makkah Travels-owned bus was about 25km short of its destination when the fatal crash occurred.Saudi authorities have started investigating the circumstances that led to the accident. In a 2023 report, the UN pointed out that Saudi had a high road fatality rate compared to other high-income countries. Transporting worshippers around Saudi’s holy sites has frequently proven dangerous, particularly during Haj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams, sources said.","At least 45 Umrah pilgrims from Hyderabad charred early Monday in a bus inferno triggered by a highway collision with a fuel tanker.

The counsel for the officer countered her plea and sought time to file a response. The court thereafter granted the lawyer three weeks' time. CBI filed an application in 2023 for lifting the stay order passed by the apex court in 2018.

BENGALURU: Metro services on the Yellow Line were disrupted for over 30 minutes Monday morning after a group of passengers halted a train at RV Road station, demanding that BMRCL start operations at 5am on the newly opened corridor.The incident occurred at 6am, when 10-15 commuters allegedly stood between the doors of a departing train, preventing them from closing and allowing the train to leave the station.Based on a complaint from BMRCL, an FIR was registered against unidentified passengers for obstructing services. While operations on Purple and Green Lines begin around 4.30am Mondays, Yellow Line — connecting RV Road to Bommasandra — currently starts its first service at 6am.Officials said this mismatch left early officer-goers frustrated and airport-bound commuters waiting at RV Road station. When train ID02 arrived at 5.55am, a group of passengers is said to have confronted staff, questioning why the service hadn't commenced earlier. Despite explanations that Yellow Line services cannot operate before 6am due to limited availability of trainsets, passengers continued to argue.Instead of boarding, they stood between the coach doors, preventing them from closing each time the loco pilot attempted to start the train. This led to a cascading delay of nearly 35 minutes, affecting subsequent schedules and inconveniencing hundreds of passengers during early-morning rush.A senior official said BMRCL is currently operating Yellow Line with all available trainsets, leaving no spare rakes to be deployed for earlier services. ""Passengers disrupted operations, causing delays across multiple trains. We had to call police to resolve the situation,"" the official said.Later to make up for the disruption, BMRCL ran a short-loop service up to Silk Board.In an official release, the corporation warned that obstructing Metro operations is a punishable offence under Metro Railway (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, and could attract imprisonment, fines, or both. ""Such actions compromise safety and inconvenience thousands,"" the statement read.It also highlighted recent improvements since Nov 1 — after adding the fifth trainset, Yellow Line start time was advanced from 6:30am to 6am, and peak-hour headway was reduced from 19 minutes to 15. More improvements are expected as additional trains are inducted into the service, it said.","Metro services on the Yellow Line were disrupted for over 30 minutes Monday morning.

India Sends Strong Warning To Pakistan As Army Chief Says The Real Movie Begins After Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday delivered a strong message to Pakistan and terror outfits operating from its soil, declaring that India’s recent counterterror offensive, Operation Sindoor , was “just a trailer” and that the country is fully prepared for future challenges.His clear warning to Pakistan comes days after a car blast in the vicinity of historical Red Fort in New Delhi.Addressing the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, the Army chief said India would deal equally with terrorists and those backing them. ""When a country encourages state-sponsored terrorism, it becomes a matter of concern for India. India talks about progress. If someone creates obstacles in our course, then we will have to take some action against them.""""When we talk about the new normal, we have said that talks and terror can't go together. All we are asking is to adopt a peaceful process, which we will cooperate with. Until then, we will treat terrorists and their sponsors alike. We will respond to those who encourage terrorists. Today, India is so accomplished that it is not scared of any blackmail attempts,"" he said.Speaking about Operation Sindoor, he added, ""Operation Sindoor was just a trailer which ended in 88 hours.We are prepared for any circumstances in future. If Pakistan gives a chance, we will teach it how to behave responsibly with a neighbouring nation...""The Army chief further noted that modern conflict requires coordination across several platforms, saying, ""In today's time, battles are multi-domain. We cannot say how long it will last. We have to ensure we have supplies to last long.""Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the Pakistan-backed Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which claimed 26 lives in Anantnag district, Jammu and Kashmir. India later launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, destroying multiple terror hubs and air bases across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The standoff eased only after Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations initiated talks for a peace agreement.

An integrated draft electoral roll will be published on Dec 27, followed by the filing of claims and objections from Dec 27 to Jan 22, 2026. These will be disposed of by Feb 2, and the final roll will be published on Feb 10.Explaining the rationale behind not ordering a SIR in Assam, a senior EC functionary said the legal criteria to determine citizenship, including the cutoff date, is different for Assam vis-a-vis the rest of the country. Also, while a national register of citizens (NRC) was prepared for Assam in 2019, the final data is yet to be published, and Supreme Court is seized of the matter. Conducting a SIR at this juncture would have led to a conflict between SIR and NRC data. In any case, over 10,000 citizenship challenges are still pending before foreigners tribunals, the functionary said.On use of the nomenclature ""special revision"" and not the usual ""annual or special summary revision"", the EC officer said that Section 21(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, terms any roll revision by EC with a different procedure as ""special"" revision. EC also avoided the term ""summary"" revision as it signifies a non-serious exercise not necessarily covering H2H verification. ""This exercise will require the mandatory three H2H visits by BLOs to get the forms signed by each elector,"" said the officer.During the field verification, BLOs will be given a pre-filled register listing the existing electors. They will collect information on voters who are dead, registered at multiple places or permanently shifted, as well as roll corrections in Statement 1, on unenrolled eligible citizens in Statement 2, and on prospective electors in Statement 3.","Assam due for assembly polls next year, with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date. The SR will involve mandatory house-to-house (H2H) verification. It will not seek documentation from any elector to prove their eligibility to vote.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125395423,imgsize-845479,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

"Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death, Dhaka reiterates extradition call; India non-committal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/death-penalty-for-hasina-dhaka-wants-her-back/articleshow/125398370.cms,"Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights

.

.





Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

QTCinderella reveals the real reason some streamers don’t get nominated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/qtcinderella-reveals-the-real-reason-some-streamers-dont-get-nominated/articleshow/125394908.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“problematic”

“blackballed”

Why some streamer communities fail to influence nominations the way they expect

“Somebody said, ‘Are problematic people blackballed from getting nominated?’ No! They’ve just never nominated.

Turns out, their audience doesn’t show up. Audiences will complain every year that they weren’t nominated and then not do nominations on stream or not tweet… they’ll give nothing.”





QTCinderella has addressed a recurring controversy surrounding the Streamer Awards, clarifying why certain creators, often labeledby the community, consistently fail to appear on nomination lists. For years, online debates have suggested that these personalities are deliberately excluded orfrom the event. But according to QTCinderella, the truth has nothing to do with backstage politics and everything to do with audience participation. Her explanation comes amid another wave of complaints from fans of overlooked streamers frustrated by the annual results.In a recent stream, she pushed back on claims that any creator is blocked from eligibility, emphasizing that the nomination and voting system is overwhelmingly fan-driven. She explained that while some communities loudly criticize the award outcomes, they rarely take part in the process that actually determines nominees. Streaming audiences that don’t show up for nomination streams, social media campaigns, or voting rounds leave their favorite creators at a natural disadvantage, regardless of popularity or controversy. QTCinderella noted that this pattern repeats every year, and the misconceptions persist just as consistently.QTCinderella made it clear that the system itself is not designed to exclude anyone. Instead, she said the lack of engagement from certain fanbases is the real issue,The Streamer Awards operates on a structure where 70% of the outcome is determined by fans and 30% by panelists. This means that if a community doesn’t actively participate, whether through sharing voting links, hosting nomination discussions, or mobilizing on social media, their favorite streamer is statistically unlikely to rise into contention. In contrast, creators with highly engaged, mobilized audiences consistently dominate the nomination lists, even when they aren’t the largest streamers overall.As QTCinderella reiterated, the issue isn’t about drama, character, or reputation, it’s simply about numbers.QTCinderella’s explanation highlights a long-standing reality of the Streamer Awards: engagement, not controversy, decides visibility. As long as some fanbases continue to be passive during nomination season, the pattern of missing or overlooked streamers is likely to continue, regardless of how loud the complaints grow afterward.Also Read: Misogynistic hate mob targets QTCinderella amid Streamer Awards controversy — Here’s what happened","QTCinderella has addressed a recurring controversy surrounding the Streamer Awards.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights





Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday slammed the International Crimes Tribunal’s decision to sentence her to death on charges of “crimes against humanity”.In a statement, Hasina claimed that the ruling, linked to the student-led protests of August 2024, was “biased and politically motivated.”""The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,"" Hasina said. ""They are biased and politically motivated. Its guilty verdict against me was a foregone conclusion.""She acknowledged the government had lost control of the situation at the time but maintained that the unrest did not amount to a ""premeditated"" assault on civilians.""We lost control of the situation but cannot characterise what happened as premeditated assault on citizens,"" Hasina said.Criticising the verdicts, Hasina described the process as “rigged” and alleged that the drive for a death sentence was a calculated effort by hardline officials to sideline her and undermine her party, Awami League.Also read: Bangladesh's ousted PM Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death; key takeaways from verdict ""In their distasteful call for the death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim government to remove Bangladesh’s last elected prime minister, and to nullify the Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina added.She defended her record in office, citing Bangladesh’s accession to the International Criminal Court, the sheltering of Rohingya refugees, major gains in electricity access and education, and significant economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.""We led Bangladesh to join the International Criminal Court in 2010, gave refuge to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar, expanded access to electricity and education, and presided over a 450% GDP growth over 15 years, lifting millions out of poverty. These achievements are a matter of historical record,"" Hasina said.She said these achievements demonstrate her government’s commitment to human rights , adding that her critics, including Yunus (chief adviser) can claim ""no achievements that are remotely comparable.""Hasina was sentenced to death on Monday by the International Crimes Tribunal in Dhaka, which found her guilty of “crimes against humanity” in connection with last year’s student-led protests that precipitated the fall of her Awami League government.Also read: No real evidence against me, says Sheikh Hasina ahead of crucial verdict Meanwhile, Bangladesh's interim government has described the death sentence handed down to Sheikh Hasina as a “historic verdict.” It also urged the public to remain calm, exercise restraint, and act responsibly in the wake of the decision.According to the charge document, the tribunal stated, ""Sheikh Hasina has committed crimes against humanity. Six protesters at Chankharpul were killed using lethal weapons on August 5. By issuing orders and through the inaction of Sheikh Hasina, the then home minister, and the IG of police, the students were killed.

Protests erupted in Bangladesh following ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina' death sentence over 'crimes against humanity'. Demonstrators clashed with security forces while trying to pull down the remaining parts of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s house. The Rapid Action Battalion moved in to block the attempt, using batons, sound grenades and tear gas to drive the protesters back. Police told the Daily Star that at least six sound grenades went off on Mirpur Road.“Several sound grenades were used to disperse the protesters,” said Masud Alam. Both protesters and police were injured as bricks were thrown and officers carried out baton-charges.Even after being pushed away once, some protesters gathered again near Square Hospital on Panthapath, where police fired more tear gas. Traffic on Mirpur Road and nearby areas stopped completely, and most shops shut their shutters.Police had controlled both sides of Mirpur Road earlier in the day, but around 2:45pm they stepped back as protesters pushed forward. By about 3:05pm, the army, police and Rab moved in together with batons and sound grenades and took back control of the area, the agency reported.The protesters had brought two excavators before the protests broke out, showing they planned to dismantle the house.Parts of the building had already been damaged in a protest in February. Police set up barricades at the front gate and have not allowed anyone inside since.Witnesses said crowds began gathering from around 11:30am, marching towards Dhanmondi 32 and shouting slogans against the deposed prime minister.They chanted “Delhi na Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka!”; “Bottrish na Chhottrish? Chhottrish, Chhottrish!”; “Dalali na Mukti? Mukti, Mukti!”; and “Khuni Hasinar Fashi Chai,” the Daily Star reported.Earlier in the day, Bangladesh’s interim government called the death sentence given to Sheikh Hasina a “historic verdict”. It has also urged people to stay calm, show restraint and act responsibly after the ruling.The court said she was responsible both for giving orders and for failing to stop the killings during the unrest.However, the former PM responded, ""the verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate.”She also called the ruling ""biased and politically motivated.”",Protests erupted in Bangladesh following ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina' death sentence over 'crimes against humanity' Demonstrators clashed with security forces while trying to pull down the remaining parts of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s house.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125385767,imgsize-193244,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Elon Musk under fire for claiming Americans can't do challenging physical work amid H-1B row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-under-fire-for-claiming-americans-cant-do-challenging-physical-work-amid-h-1b-row/articleshow/125387130.cms,"Elon Musk has now said Americans can't do challenging physical work.

First while collar jobs, now blue collar jobs







Elon Musk has triggered a fresh controversy amid the already raging H-1B war as he claimed that America has a major shortage of people who can do challenging physical work. He said Americans don't even wish to train for this. Musk made the comment as he reacted to Ford CEO Jim Farley's latest alarm that Ford is struggling to fill 5000 mechanic positions with a $120,000 pay per year. But the timing of the comment is crucial as too many people are telling Americans that they are lacking in something or the other.President Donald Trump said in a recent FOX News interview that America needs certain talents from outside countries and hence his administration would not stop the H-1B visa program. As an example, Trump cited the battery workers from South Korea who were raided recently. Trump said such type of work needs expertise that Americans don't have.This triggered a fresh H-1B row as the Donald Trump administration appears not to have found out what it wants to do with foreign workers. It imposed a hefty fee of $100,000 for companies that would hire foreigners on H-1B making it difficult for them but it won't stop H-1B as it's believed that Silicon Valley companies need high-skilled STEM employees.And Americans are not good at that.Now Elon Musk, who has been a staunch advocate for the H-1B as his companies rely majorly on this, said Americans are not interested in challenging physical work either.Elon Musk's comment drew flak as social media users observed that Elon's comment is coming from the same place of underestimating Americans. Users commented that this is how the CEOs first stole white collar jobs, claiming that Americans are not good at STEM and now they are pushing the narrative that Americans are not good at physical labor either.""Do you know how many young kids would gladly be a mechanic for 120k a year? All you have to do is invest in them and actually teach them. But we all know you don't want to do that, because labor is the biggest expense for every company, so you will just lie about it and import foreigners for tax breaks and to pay less,"" one wrote replying to Elon.""Correction: we can’t find American workers to do challenging physical work at suppressed wages for employers who have no loyalty to them, therefore we must import cheap foreign labor with no exit options or bargaining power,"" another wrote.","Elon Musk has triggered a fresh controversy amid the already raging H-1B war as he claimed that America has a major shortage of people who can do challenging physical work.

Sleuths probe 'shoe bomber' angle

NEW DELHI: Intensifying its probe into the Red Fort suicide bombing, NIA on Monday arrested another Kashmiri resident in the case and revealed that the module was planning to carry out Hamas-style terror attacks using drones. The Jaish module was also in the process of making small rockets that were to be used in the serial blasts planned by the group.The second suspect has been identified as Jasir Bilal Wani alias Danish, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district in J&K. TOI had reported on Monday that he was detained and being interrogated. Calling him a key associate of suicide bomber Umar, NIA said that Danish was arrested from Srinagar by its team that was in the Valley to probe the case.""NIA's investigation has revealed that Wani had provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast,"" the probe agency said in a statement.The drones were to be equipped with a camera and battery. Small but powerful bombs were supposed to be fitted in them for triggering blasts at crowded places but the sinister plan was foiled as the module was busted.Such attacks are carried out by terror groups like Hamas & IS in Syria, Iraq, Israel & Afghanistan, and attempts were being made to replicate that model here, sources said.Similar to the Hamas-style drone attack plan, a terror strike using drones was carried out by Pakistan-based terrorists at the Jammu air force station in 2021. Two low-flying drones were used to drop two improvised explosive devices, which was the first of its kind.Wani, officials said, was an 'active co-conspirator' in the attack and had worked closely with Umar un Nabi to plan the terror carnage. ""Several teams of the anti-terror agency are pursuing multiple leads, and are conducting searches across states to identify every person involved in the attack. NIA continues to explore various angles to unravel the conspiracy behind the bombing,"" said a senior NIA officer.Danish's name had surfaced during the interrogation of arrested doctors as one of the alleged members of the module. During questioning, Danish, a political science graduate, told investigators that he first met the doctor module last October at a mosque in Kulgam, TOI had reported on Monday. Umar had asked him to come to his rented accommodation linked to Al Falah University in Faridabad to participate in the terror attack, Danish reportedly disclosed.Also read: Delhi car blast case: Shaheen & Parvez's travels abroad hold key to terror plot On Sunday, NIA had arrested Kashmiri resident Amir Rashid Ali in whose name the i20 car involved in the attack was registered. A resident of Pampore, Ali was arrested from Delhi.Meanwhile, investigators are trying to ascertain if Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist Umar Un Nabi operated as a 'shoe bomber. This line of inquiry emerged after sleuths made a crucial recovery at the blast site: a shoe found beneath the driving seat, near the right front tyre of i20 car.The discovery points towards a pattern chillingly similar to the infamous Dec 2001 attempt by Richard Reid, who tried to detonate a TATP (triacetone triperoxide) explosive hidden in his shoes on an American Airlines flight. Forensic teams examining the recovered shoe found a metallic substance inside, which is currently being scrutinised to determine if it functioned as a trigger mechanism for the explosive device.Further substantiating the theory of an attempted 'shoe bomb' explosion, traces of TATP have also been identified and recovered from both the tyre and shoe at the blast location, sources said. In addition to the evidence pointing towards a personal explosive device, investigators have also confirmed finding traces of explosives in the area beneath the car's rear seat, suggesting the potential involvement of multiple explosive components in the plot.","Jasir Bilal Wani alias Danish, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district in J&K, has been arrested.

BENGALURU: A routine temple visit turned costly for a software engineer whose shoes, worth Rs 16,000, were stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple in Banashankari III Stage, south Bengaluru.When cops were initially reluctant to file an FIR for footwear theft, the techie insisted they do so because he claimed it's a common occurrence outside temples.The Girinagar resident told police his shoes, bought just six months back, were stolen between 7.20pm and 7.25pm on Nov 6. Wearing his branded shoes (Asics), the complainant visited the temple on his motorcycle. He parked his bike and left his shoes in front of the temple where other devotees had left their footwear.After offering prayers, he walked out of the temple within five minutes only to find his shoes missing. He then approached the temple management and priest. ""I learned that it was a common problem in the temple. The thieves have not even spared the priest. His slippers were stolen twice in the past. Many devotees too shared incidents of losing their footwear. But none of them had filed a complaint with police. I didn't want to ignore such incidents,"" the complainant told TOI.The CCTV camera installed at the temple entrance caught the thief walking barefoot, posing as a devotee, and leaving with the complainant's shoes.A couple of footwear thieves were caught in the past, and they revealed that they usually sold the stolen footwear for Rs 20 to Rs 50 to buy liquor.""If small thefts are ignored, the same person will commit bigger crimes, so they should be taught a lesson and reformed,"" said the complainant.A senior police officer said a case has been registered under the BNS section 303 (theft), CCTV footage have been collected and efforts are on to nab the thief.","Software engineer's shoes, worth Rs 16,000, stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple.

Multiple IEDs, 32 Vehicles: Agencies Uncover Plan For Serial Car Explosions In Delhi Blast Probe

NEW DELHI: Dr Umar Un Nabi, the man behind the deadly Red Fort blast on November 10, had recorded a bone-chilling video in which he calmly discussed the concept of suicide bombing.During the investigation into the Delhi bombing, officers recovered an undated video showing Umar sitting alone in a room, speaking with disturbing ease about suicide attacks.He says that what is commonly described as a suicide bombing is, in his view, a “martyrdom operation”, a term he claims is known in Islam.In the video, Umar claims that what is commonly referred to as a suicide bombing is “not understood correctly.”He argues that many “contradictions and objections” have been raised against it, but insists that the act is a deliberate operation carried out by someone who believes they will certainly die at a specific place and time.“One of the biggest misunderstandings is what people label as suicide bombing,” Umar says in the footage.“When a person believes he is definitely going to die at a particular time or a particular place, he goes against the presumption that he is going to die in a particular situation. If not, we don't have a situation.""The video intended to brainwash and radicalise others, as Umar was considered the most ideologically extreme member of the so-called “white-collar” Faridabad terror module behind the attack.In the undated footage, Umar elaborates on his definition of a “martyrdom operation,” saying it involves a person assuming with certainty that they will die in a particular situation—an idea he attempts to distinguish from suicide, despite both leading to the same fatal outcome.The high-intensity blast ripped through a bustling street near the Red Fort, shattering shopfronts and triggering panic across Old Delhi, leaving 15 dead and 28 injured.","Dr Umar Un Nabi, the man behind the deadly Red Fort blast on November 10, had recorded a bone-chilling video in which he calmly discussed the concept of suicide bombing.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein. The release of the latest documents has revived scrutiny over the depth and duration of their relationship.","Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, in a 24-page opinion, said the record showed a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” and raised the prospect of government misconduct that warranted an “extraordinary remedy,” according to CBS news.Fitzpatrick said prosecutors and at least one FBI agent displayed a “cavalier” attitude toward the legal rights of Comey and others and criticised Trump-appointed prosecutor Lindsey Halligan for what he called “fundamental misstatements of the law” to the grand jury, The Washington Post reported.Fitzpatrick ordered disclosure of the full grand jury transcripts and audio recordings to Comey’s defence team, saying that, while grand jury material is normally secret, the exceptional concerns in this case justified disclosure.Late on Monday, however, the federal district judge overseeing the prosecution temporarily stayed Fitzpatrick’s order at the Justice Department’s request. US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would review the magistrate’s decision and rule in the coming days, according to CBS news.The magistrate warned that procedural and substantive flaws in pre-grand jury conduct and in how evidence was collected and presented “may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr.Comey.""Comey is charged on two counts alleging that he made false statements in testimony to Congress. He has pleaded not guilty and has sought dismissal on multiple grounds, including the grand jury irregularities Fitzpatrick described, arguments over the legality of Halligan’s appointment and alleges that the prosecution amounts to an improper extension of US President Donald Trump’s personal animus, The Washington Post reported.","US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, in a 24-page opinion, said the record showed a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” and raised the prospect of government misconduct.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

'Plan To Rule...': Trump’s Gaza Plan Stuns Netanyahu; U.S.-Led Force To ‘Seize Strip’?





The United Nations Security Council on Monday approved a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump ’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, giving the proposal a binding international mandate after two years of conflict.The resolution received 13 votes in favour with zero vetoes, while Russia and China abstained. It authorises the creation of an International Stabilisation Force, or ISF, which the US said that several unnamed countries have expressed willingness to join.The force would be tasked with entering Gaza, overseeing demilitarisation, securing key areas and supporting the delivery of humanitarian assistance. It would also coordinate its operations with Israel and Egypt, Gaza’s southern neighbour.However, Hamas has rejected the resolution, arguing that it does not address Palestinian rights and imposes an unwanted external authority on the territory. In a statement on Telegram, the group said the plan “imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,” and added that giving the stabilisation force a mandate to disarm resistance groups “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation”, news agency Reuters reported.The draft resolution states that the ISF would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” including Hamas, which would be required to surrender its weapons under Trump’s proposal.The draft also calls for the creation of a newly trained Palestinian police force to eventually take over policing responsibilities in Gaza, replacing the Hamas-run force currently in place.US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the council that the stabilisation force would be “tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians.” He described the initial ceasefire phase, which began on 10 October with the exchange of hostages and detainees, as a “fragile, fragile first step. ”The plan also proposes the establishment of a Board of Peace, which Trump is expected to head, and a World Bank-supported trust fund to support Gaza’s reconstruction.The vote took place as global actors sought to maintain the fragile ceasefire following the war that began with Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s subsequent offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.","US-drafted resolution endorsed President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

Around 2,000 people joined the protest that took place on Sunday in Crowborough, East Sussex, against government plans to accommodate 540 single male asylum seekers at a disused army camp on the edge of the town.During the protests, mothers led chants of “Starmer out” as marchers carried Union Jacks, St George’s crosses, and handwritten placards with slogans including “Protect Us. Protect our children” and “Our children’s freedom gone, so they can have theirs,” The Times reported.This comes after a heated public meeting on Thursday, where private security guards intervened when local politicians were chased out of the community centre hall. Some residents said they were installing panic alarms in their homes and raised concerns about access to local GP services, which are already in high demand, the BBC reported.The government announced in October that the asylum seekers would be accommodated at the disused army camp, as part of efforts to end the use of hotels for migrant accommodation. A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC that the move aims to provide “more suitable accommodation” while public safety remains the first priority.Kim Bailey, chairwoman of Crowborough Shield, a grassroots organisation formed to challenge home secretary Shabana Mahmood, claimed that the plans were “absurd"" Highlighting potential risks for asylum seekers with PTSD living near a police firearms training centre and public shooting range, she said “It’s absurd what they are doing. Vulnerable men from war-torn countries, to Crowborough?She added that the men are “unvetted” and that the rural location could make it difficult for authorities to respond if crime occurs. The campaign has raised more than £12,000 to fund legal action against the Home Office.Wealden District Council, controlled by an alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrat, and Green councillors, criticised the Home Office for an “information vacuum” around the plans, which it said fuelled community tension and threats against local politicians. Crowborough, along with Cameron Barracks in Inverness, were the first military sites identified to accommodate a total of 900 asylum seekers, The Times reported.The Home Office said all residents will undergo mandatory security checks and that “as part of their induction process, clear expectations are set out to asylum seekers staying at the site about their expected behaviour while on and off the site.” Kerrie Knight, an organiser of the Pink Ladies campaign, told The Times the protests were “not about race or religion” but about “risk and safety” and “common sense.”","Around 2,000 people joined the protest that took place on Sunday in Crowborough, East Sussex, against government plans to accommodate 540 single male asylum seekers.

"Did FBI remove Trump’s name from Epstein files? Report claims review of 100,000 documents, 300GB of evidence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-fbi-remove-trumps-name-from-epstein-files-report-claims-review-of-100000-documents-300gb-of-evidence/articleshow/125394873.cms,"In a recent twist, a report has emerged indicating that Donald Trump's name may have been omitted from the FBI's files on Jeffrey Epstein, igniting a fresh wave of debate. Initially downplaying the gravity of the situation, Trump has now pivoted, calling on House Republicans to unveil the documents in a bid for transparency.

Epstein Files’ Unexpected TWIST: Trump Tells Republicans to Release The Documents Amid GOP Revolt1





An old report has brought back a question Donald Trump ’s team hoped would disappear: did the FBI work through the night to remove his name from the Jeffrey Epstein files before saying there was nothing left to release? The timing is important as Trump has suddenly reversed his stance on making the documents public.Trump announced on Truth Social: “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.” It marked a sudden U-turn after months of resisting pressure from both parties. His shift only came once it became clear that the House was preparing to move forward without him.The move was surprising given that Trump had previously dismissed the Epstein issue as a Democratic “hoax” despite having campaigned on transparency in 2024. Bloomberg reported in August this year that an FBI FOIA team had already blacked out Trump’s name from the documents during an exhaustive internal review.Sources familiar with the process told Bloomberg, “We know from news reports that Trump’s name was in the Epstein files. But what hasn’t been reported is that an FBI FOIA team redacted Trump’s name and the names of other prominent public figures from the documents.”The review involved up to 1,000 FBI agents and staff working through more than 100,000 documents.The White House referred questions about the redactions to the FBI. The FBI declined to comment and the Justice Department offered no response. In July, DOJ and the FBI said they had collected more than 300 gigabytes of Epstein-related evidence but concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The decision angered Trump’s base, with Joe Rogan accusing the administration of “trying to gaslight” its own supporters.The fight over the files also caused serious political fallout. After Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene signed the discharge petition, Trump called her a “ranting Lunatic” and withdrew his endorsement.The House is now expected to back the release of the files, though the Senate will require 60 votes. At the same time, Trump has urged Republicans to refocus on economic issues, warning that Epstein is a “trap.” And that Democrats are trying to distract Americans from the shutdown, he said last week.","A report has emerged indicating that Donald Trump's name may have been omitted from the FBI's files on Jeffrey Epstein.

Probe reveals Trump shooter Thomas Crooks’s links to ‘furry’ porn; MAGA says ‘kid was programmed’ to kill president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/probe-reveals-trump-shooter-thomas-crookss-links-to-furry-porn-maga-says-kid-was-programmed-to-kill-president/articleshow/125393725.cms,"Emerging revelations about Thomas Crooks, the suspect in the alleged Trump shooting, showcase a dual life dominated by 'furry' artwork and extremist dialogues. Investigators have traced anonymous profiles tied to niche cartoon fetish content and chilling violent discourse.

'We have more guns than they do'





Trump shooter Thomas Crooks’s trans “furry” fantasies have surfaced as investigators and online researchers uncover more of his hidden digital life. New findings suggest the would-be assassin spent years posting under anonymous accounts linked to cartoon fetish art and extremist conversations, according to the Daily Mail.According to the Daily Beast, Crooks final search before shooting POTUS was porn.Donald Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2024. Online accounts under the names “epicmicrowave” and “theepicmicrowave” on the site DeviantArt are now being connected to him. The platform hosts pornographic “furry” material involving human-animal hybrid characters. Activity on the accounts showed the use of “they/them” pronouns and an interest in cartoon figures with exaggerated male physiques and female heads.The information follows a detailed investigation presented by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, who examined Crooks’s online activity, his past political views and a shift from supporting Trump to embracing violent far-left rhetoric.One of the most chilling revelations is Crooks’s interaction with a Norwegian user called “Willy_Tepes”. Carlson says the name appears on a foreign Antifa website linking the user to the Nordic Resistance Movement, which the United States has designated a terrorist organisation.FBI has not publicly mentioned the user, though Carlson said investigators would be aware of the account.Crooks’s online exchanges with Tepes touched on political violence. On 4 August 2020 Tepes wrote: “If a gun and a badge is all that is needed, then authority obviously comes from the barrel of a gun. We have more guns than they do ;)” He added: “There is no way we can avoid a war at this point, so you just better get used to the idea.”In another message he said: “The more guns that are out there, the less likely a gun confiscation will be possible. Nope, guns do not guarantee a victory anymore than jet fighters, tanks and drones do. It is the fighting spirit and brains that wins.” He continued: “We have nothing to lose and everything to win... and the alternative, a global police state, is unacceptable. Nothing in life is simple but that is no argument against doing it :)”After these interactions, Crooks’s YouTube comments came to an abrupt end.Separate comments from early 2020 suggest a political shift. Carlson’s team reports that Crooks mocked Trump supporters as a “cult” and criticised the US president for his “stupidity”. He allegedly described ways to attack government buildings, writing: “the only way to fight the [government] is with terrorism style attacks, sneak a bomb into an essential building [and] set it off before anyone sees you”.MAGA figures reacted to Carlson’s findings. Congressman Tim Burchett suggested Crooks was manipulated by intelligence agencies, telling Benny Johnson: “They programmed this kid. You got a kid who’s got access to guns or has some simple knowledge of a firearm, he was programmed.”Kash Patel responded separately, saying the FBI had gathered extensive data. Patel wrote: “The investigation, conducted by over 480 FBI employees, revealed Crooks had limited online and in-person interactions, planned and conducted the attack alone, and did not leak or share his intent to engage in the attack with anyone.”The FBI maintains that Crooks acted alone and that no evidence links him to foreign direction.","Investigators trace online profiles tied to cartoon fetish content.

While the MAGA world is divided over Tucker Carlson's interview of Nick Fuentes, President Donald Trump 's verdict on the issue spelled more trouble as Trump refused to condemn Carlson. Tucker, the former Fox News host, recently interviewed white nationalist Nick Fuentes who said he admired Hitler. Giving the Holocaust denier a mainstream platform made Tucker Carlson the villain in the MAGA base but Donald Trump said people can't dictate to Carlson who he should interview.Trump said he does not know much about Nick Fuentes, but if Tucker Carlson wants to interview him, so be it. Fuentes responded on X, ""Thank you Mr. President!"" with a video of the president's remarks.Conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation is at the center of a major controversy as several of its staff members quit after its president Kevin Roberts supported Tucker and said the call to cancel him is being made by a ""venomous coalition"". Then Roberts apologized for his statement and said he madea mistake and also the speech endorsing Tucker was written by a staff.But Roberts did not withdraw his earlier statement. On Monday, legal scholar Robert P. George announced his resignation from the Foundation's board, saying he could not stay unless Roberts retracted the video.""Although Kevin publicly apologized for some of what he said in the video, he could not offer a full retraction of its content,"" he wrote in a post shared to Facebook.""So, we reached an impasse.""The MAGA split comes with a 2028 opportunity with Israel supporter Ted Cruz.

Does FBI protect Congressmen?





Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell reacted to the report of FBI director Kash Patel deploying SWAT team members for girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' security and said he does not wish ill for either Patel or his girlfriend, but the FBI director did not pay any heed to Swalwell's request for security. ""It’s just F’d up that he REFUSES to protect me and my kids from MULTIPLE specific death threats. Same for other Dem colleagues. Can only conclude he wants us dead,"" the Democrat leader said.A report by MS NOW claimed that Wilkins' security detail is made up of the elite FBI agents who are usually assigned to SWAT team in the FBI field office in Nashville. The FBI has not commented on the claim, while MAGA activists started adding fuel to the fire, wondering whether Alexis Wilkins is Kash Patel's spouse.A director's wife gets high-profile security, considering she stays with the FBI director, but Alexis Wilkins does not stay with Patel. It is their staying apart that put Patel in a fix and he was accused of flying frequently to meet Alexis on a government jet. The FBI earlier set the record straight and confirmed that director Patel broke no rules by doing that he always pays advanced reimbursement before taking out the government jet for personal travel.FBi directos are not allowed to fly commercial.Generally, the FBI does not provide routine protection for Congressmen. The US Secret Service and US Capitol Police are responsible for the safety of Senators and Representatives.Swalwell earlier wrote to the Justice Department complaining about the threats and noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi promised to step up the protection of elected officials after the murder of Charlie Kirk. ""We have a number of direct specific threats to me and my kids that have not been prosecuted, and we were sent letters saying they would not be prosecuted,"" Swalwell complained. ""I don't want to be treated any better or worse than anyone else, but my fear at this point is that because I have been a critic, and I am someone who holds the president accountable, is that the DOJ is simply not going after people who threaten me.

A late-night chat about chickens took a bizarre turn in Florida after a man known as “Farmer Pete” allegedly opened fire outside a bar during an argument over egg production. Police say no one was injured, but several arrests followed, reports the New York Post.Port St. Lucie police said the incident happened earlier this month outside a pub. Officers were alerted when 44-year-old Peter Riera, who was actually the culprit, called 911 claiming he had been robbed and was being chased by two men and a woman. When officers arrived, the trio told a very different story.According to the police report, Brandon Pace, his girlfriend Kayla Damiani and their friend Tyler McHargue, said they had only met Riera that night and had been chatting casually after being introduced to him as “Farmer Pete”. Their conversation somehow drifted to chickens and how many eggs they can lay. Witnesses said Riera suddenly became paranoid and began accusing them of trying to “jump” him and attempting to “con” him.Police say Riera then pulled out a gun and fired four shots as the group ran away. Body camera footage obtained by CBS 12 later showed Riera being arrested outside the pub wearing jean overalls and apparently without shoes.The victims also ended up in trouble. Pace was arrested for allegedly obstructing officers and kicking two of them. Damiani was detained for resisting without violence and later released on a $500 bond. McHargue cooperated and was not charged.Riera remains in custody on a $435,000 bond and faces several charges, including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm in public.","Peter Riera, 44, called 911 claiming he had been robbed and was being chased by two men and a woman.
