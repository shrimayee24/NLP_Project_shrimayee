US presses for new nuclear architecture



Push for three-way talks with China



Trump had hinted at testing earlier

NEW DELHI: The United States has accused China of conducting a covert nuclear explosive test on June 22, 2020, just days after the deadly Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, saying the allegation underscores the need for a new global arms control framework following the expiry of the New START treaty.On June 15, 2020, a week before the alleged nuclear test, the Indian and Chinese troops clashed in Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, while reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 35.US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.""China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons… China has used decoupling – a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring – to hide its activities from the world. China conducted one such yield producing nuclear test on June 22, 2020,"" DiNanno said in a post on X.The date cited by the US official comes a week after the June 15, 2020, Galwan Valley face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clashes, while intelligence reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 30.DiNanno’s remarks came as the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, formally expired this week, leaving the world’s two largest nuclear powers without binding limits on their strategic arsenals for the first time in more than five decades.""New START was signed in 2010 and its limits on warheads and launchers are no longer relevant in 2026 when one nuclear power is expanding its arsenal at a scale and pace not seen in over half a century and another continues to maintain and develop a vast range of nuclear systems unconstrained by New START’s terms,"" DiNanno said.He said the treaty imposed uneven constraints on nuclear powers.""…almost all of the U.S. deployed nuclear forces were subject to New START while only a fraction of Russia's much larger stockpile was… exactly zero Chinese nuclear weapons were covered by New START,"" he said.DiNanno said alleged covert testing by China, alongside Russian violations and the growth of global nuclear stockpiles, made it necessary to pursue a new arms control framework suited to present-day threats.""This confluence of factors – serial Russian violations, growth of worldwide stockpiles, and flaws in New START’s design and implementation – gives the United States a clear imperative to call for a new architecture that addresses the threats of today, not those of a bygone era,"" he said.He added that Washington was now in a position to strengthen deterrence while remaining open to meaningful negotiations.""No longer constrained by the political-military circumstances of 2010 and the treaty they yielded and in response to the destabilizing behavior of these other countries, the United States can now finally take steps… to strengthen deterrence on behalf of the American people and our allies,"" DiNanno said.The US has renewed calls for three-way nuclear arms control talks involving China and Russia following New START’s expiration. Washington has said any future agreement must include Beijing, a demand China has firmly rejected.China has denied the US allegations of covert nuclear testing and has said it will not participate in disarmament negotiations at this stage, arguing that its nuclear arsenal remains far smaller than those of the United States and Russia.US President Donald Trump had previously hinted at similar accusations without offering details. On October 31 last year, Trump said Washington would begin nuclear testing ""on an equal basis"" with Moscow and Beijing, without elaborating on the nature of such tests.Analysts have warned that the end of New START marks a turning point in global nuclear stability, with the absence of formal limits increasing the risk of a renewed arms race amid rising geopolitical tensions and mistrust.","US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.

CHANDIGARH: Senior AAP leader Anurag Dhanda on Saturday accused the BJP government in Haryana of stopping about 37,000 players' diet allowance in the state for the past 10 months.He further slammed the ruling party for allegedly citing ""absurd"" reasons to refuse pension payments to over 75,000 elderly people in Haryana.Speaking to mediapersons here, AAP's national media in-charge Dhanda said Haryana has always been the land of sports, and most of the players who have raised the country's tricolour high in the Olympics, Commonwealth and Asian Games have come from this soil.""But today, those same players are asking whether the value of their hard work and medals is limited only to garnering applause on election platforms,"" Dhanda said.He attacked Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and said the players shed their blood and sweat on the field all day, and their parents, who earn their livelihood through hard work, work to help them win medals.Dhanda alleged that the state government had not paid the diet allowance of 37,000 players who practise in sports nurseries in the state for the past 10 months.The purpose of the sports nurseries was to enable grassroots players to get good training and nutrition so they could compete at the national and international levels, he said.He further claimed that the coaches training these players have not received their salaries either for 10 months.""Should the players focus on arranging their meals or preparing for their sport?"" the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader questioned.Dhanda alleged that the state government was closing the nurseries for two months every year. ""Does any athlete prepare for international medals by taking a two-month break?"" he asked.On the alleged suspension of pension payments to over 75,000 elderly people, he said, ""If a farmer receives Rs 1.50 or Rs 2 lakh in their account for their crop, they are being told that they have an income of Rs 3 lakh and therefore, they cannot receive pension. This means the Nayab government considers a farmer who sells crops worth Rs 3 lakh to be wealthy,"" he claimed.In some cases, pensions are being stopped by citing the total family income in the Parivar Pehchan Patra (family ID) and in some cases, due to mismatches in name, surname or age, he claimed.At many places, the entire family's income is being considered, even though the elderly person's income has no connection to the family's income, he added.Hundreds of elderly people and women are queuing up at government offices across Haryana, asking why their pensions have been cut, the AAP leader said.","Senior AAP leader Anurag Dhanda accused the BJP government in Haryana of stopping about 37,000 players' diet allowance in the state for the past 10 months.

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has issued an eight-point safety framework to prevent Janakpuri-like accidents where a biker died after falling into a DJB dug pit, and sought a list of excavation sites in the city within three days.Taking a ""very strong"" view of the tragic accident reported in the Janakpuri area of west Delhi on Friday, the chief minister has ordered immediate, time-bound action across all departments and executing agencies to prevent any recurrence of such an incident, a Delhi CMO statement said.""Expressing deep concern over lapses in safety arrangements at excavation and digging sites, the chief minister has directed strict enforcement of safety norms and fixed clear accountability on officers and contractors,"" it said.The chief secretary, on the directions of the chief minister, has issued a memorandum listing an eight-point safety framework to be followed without exception at all construction, repair and maintenance works involving digging or excavation of roads, footpaths and underground utilities across the city.According to the eight-point directive, all work sites must display proper and adequate warning signage prominently and sufficiently in advance from all approaches.Reflector lights, blinkers and luminous tapes are to be mandatorily installed around excavated areas and barricades, especially during night hours and in low-visibility conditions.Asserting that loss of life due to negligence is unacceptable, Gupta asserted that public safety cannot be compromised under any circumstances. Accountability will be fixed, and strict action will follow wherever lapses are found, she said in the statement.""The chief minister has made it clear that the safety of citizens is paramount. No department or contractor will be allowed to cut corners, and enforcement on the ground will be closely monitored,"" the statement read further.The directive applies to all departments and agencies under the administrative control of the Delhi government, including Public Works Department (PWD), Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), power distribution companies (DISCOMs) and all other executing agencies and contractors.The chief minister has also ordered that strong, continuous and clearly visible barricading be ensured around the entire work site by all departments to prevent accidental access by pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles.Barricades must be erected in a manner that eliminates the risk of accidents and ensures that no excavated material or open digging is visible to passersby or causes dust pollution.The directive fixes clear responsibility for compliance on both the concerned field officers and the executing agencies or contractors, the CMO said.Engineers-in-charge and field engineers have been instructed to conduct regular inspections of all such work sites and ensure that prescribed safety measures are maintained throughout the execution period.In a time-bound move, all departments and organisations have been ordered to carry out an immediate review of all ongoing and recently undertaken excavation and digging works within Delhi. A consolidated report detailing the locations of such sites, safety measures in place, and corrective steps taken wherever deficiencies are noticed must be submitted to the chief secretary's office within three days.The chief minister has made it unequivocally clear that any violation, laxity or non-compliance with these instructions will be viewed seriously, the statement noted.In the event of any accident, injury or loss of life attributable to negligence, strict disciplinary action will be initiated against responsible officers and agencies in accordance with rules, in addition to any other legal action that may be warranted.All departments have also been directed to immediately issue instructions to subordinate offices, field officials and executing agencies and to ensure regular monitoring and strict enforcement of these safety measures at all work sites, the statement added.","Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has issued an eight-point safety framework to prevent accidents.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said that Sangh is was not founded as reaction or in opposition to any organisation and it does not seek power or popularity.While speaking at a program held as a part of the RSS centenary celebrations in Mumbai, Bhagwat said that those who want to know about RSS, must come should come within the organisation and observe it from close quarters.""The Sangh has not emerged in competition with any other institution or organization, nor as a reaction or in opposition to anyone. The Sangh does not seek popularity. The Sangh does not seek power. Whatever good deeds are being done in the country—may they be done well; the Sangh exists to help make that happen,"" RSS chief said.""If you want to know Sangh, come inside and see it for yourself,"" he added.Bhagwat claimed that more than one lakh thirty thousand small and big seva works re carried out by RSS volunteers across the country.""More than one lakh thirty thousand small and big seva works are carried out by Swayamsevaks without taking any government money, spending their own funds with the cooperation of society. In the history of our country, no Sangh like work occurred after Tathagat Buddha,"" He said.""The work of the Sangh is meant for the entire nation — Bharatvarsh,"" he added.Talking about the situation in the country that preceded the RSS's birth in 1925, Bhagwat the British founded the Indian National Congress as a “safety valve”, but the Indians transformed it into a powerful instrument in the struggle for independence.Referring to RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Bhagwat described the difficult circumstances of his childhood including the death of both his parents due to the plague at age 13 and the financial hardship he suffered subsequently.Hedgewar actively participated in various movements during the freedom struggle, including the Vande Mataram agitation in his school days, Bhagwat said.When he cleared the matriculation examination with a first class, some people in Nagpur raised funds to send him to Calcutta (Kolkata) for medical education, where he came in contact with revolutionary groups, Bhagwat said.Recalling an anecdote from that period, Bhagwat said Hedgewar operated under the code name ""Koken"", inspired by the name of a person called Kokenchandra. Once a police team which had arrived to arrest Kokenchandra instead detained Hedgewar, an incident documented in a book by Rash Behari Bose, he said.During the ceremony, noted guests such as film actor Salman Khan , Subhash Ghai and Prasoon Joshi were also present.The two-day lecture series titled '100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons' seeks to reflect on the journey of RSS, its role in society, and the ideas and perspectives shaping its future.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said that Sangh is was not founded as reaction or in opposition to any organisation.

'Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar': Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 metro station gets new name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shree-ram-mandir-mayur-vihar-metro-station-mayur-vihar-pocket-1-gets-new-name/articleshow/128035820.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 Metro station in East Delhi has been renamed to Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar. The station is located on the Pink Line of the Delhi Metro The renamed station connects several key parts of the capital, including Anand Vihar Railway Station, Rajouri Garden, Lajpat Nagar and Delhi Cantonment, making it an important transit point for daily commuters.Explaining the reason behind the name change, Sanatan Dharm Sabha Mayur Vihar President RP Agarwal said that the demand had been pending for years.“Our committee has been working on this for the past three years. We had sent a letter to Virendra Sachdeva, who forwarded it to the Chief Minister. This is an important achievement for us. When the metro train moves forward from Mayur Vihar Phase 1, the announcement will be made that the next station is ‘Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar’. This will increase the popularity of our Ram temple,” Agarwal said.Highlighting commuter convenience, Sanatan Dharm Sabha patron and Delhi Senior Citizen Welfare Association Vice President Govind Singh Pawar said that the earlier name often caused confusion.“People used to get confused between Mayur Vihar Phase 1 and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1. The BJP government, which promotes Sanatan Dharma, has corrected this.The people are very happy with this decision,” he said.The renaming fits into a broader policy of revising metro station names to better reflect local identity and reduce confusion for passengers.Last year, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta announced the renaming of three metro stations to enhance passenger convenience. Pitampura Metro Station on the Red Line was renamed to Madhuban Chowk Metro Station, while two stations on the under-construction RK Puram–Janakpuri corridor will be called North Pitampura–Prashant Vihar Metro Station and Haiderpur Village Metro Station.Addressing the public at the time, Gupta said the changes were linked to local history and identity. She later wrote on X that the renaming was being done “for the convenience of passengers” and to clearly define neighbourhoods.","The station is located on the Pink Line of the Delhi Metro.

I will go straight to the Court. I will not go to the police station. If they want, they can house arrest me. The Court has called me. Police reached here in civil uniform like criminals.

'Can't be compelled': SC allows termination of minor's 30-wk fetus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minor-has-right-over-reproductive-choice-supreme-court/articleshow/128008025.cms,"Minor has right over reproductive choice: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: It was difficult for Supreme Court to decide - protect the interests of a 30-week pregnant minor girl who did not want an illegitimate child and seek termination of pregnancy or save the unborn child who, as a 30-week fetus, has a beating heart. But the scale of justice tilted in favour of the girl and SC allowed termination of pregnancy, saying she can't be compelled to give birth to a child.Finding itself in the tricky situation as it was asked to prioritise the competing interests, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan admitted it was not easy for it to decide the case. The court finally allowed the plea of the pregnant girl's mother.NEW DELHI: A minor's mother sought Supreme Court's permission for termination of her daughter's pregnancy, taking into consideration that the child would be illegitimate and the girl had to live her life with mental trauma and social stigma. The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 allows abortion up to 20 weeks based on the opinion of one registered medical practitioner, and up to 24 weeks for specific categories of women (including rape survivors and minors) with the opinion of two doctors.Contending that she did not want to give birth to the child, the petitioner sought abortion on the grounds that continuing with pregnancy and giving birth would cause her trauma.Maharashtra govt however, told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart and termination at this stage would result in premature birth of a child who would face the risk of abnormality. The lawyer for the state, Devanshi Singh, contended that the baby could be handed over to an orphanage.The bench asked the state whose interests it was trying to protect. The lawyer responded that it was for the court to take a call. She also brought to the notice of the bench an earlier order passed by SC in 2017, when termination of more than 30 weeks pregnancy was allowed as the girl was only 13 and a rape survivor.Considering the totality of the situation, the court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide. ""It is an illegitimate child. We don't want to comment on the relationship. They cannot get married and she has to carry the stigma for the rest of her life. We have to consider her mental aspect. Can the court ask her to continue with the pregnancy and deliver the child? If we do, then people would not come to court to seek permission and they would go to quack and illegal centres for abortion and life and health would be put at risk,"" the bench said.""Whose interest would prevail is the question. It is very difficult to decide,"" the SC bench said.With any delay likely to complicate the situation further, the bench directed termination of pregnancy. ""We direct the JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, to conduct the procedure of medical termination of pregnancy of the daughter of the appellant herein by bearing in mind all medical safeguards,"" the bench said.The mother had moved SC, through lawyer Shantanu Adkar, after her plea was rejected by Bombay HC, which had held that a forced termination would amount to feticide as the ""fetus is healthy and viable"". It had directed that the teen be provided comprehensive medical and psychological support until her delivery and the child be given away to a registered orphanage.According to the petition, the pregnancy was the result of the girl's relationship with a friend. The mother alleged that the friend had forced the girl into a physical relationship after promising to marry her and FIR had been filed against him.",The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy. Maharashtra govt told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart. The court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128008111,imgsize-182462,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor-headed Jan Suraaj Party on Friday was criticised by the Supreme Court for filing a writ petition seeking annulment of recently concluded Bihar assembly elections on the ground that the poll-eve Rs 10,000 dole to women was a corrupt practice that altered the level-playing field.""How many votes did your party get? People rejected you in the elections. Now you want to use the judicial platform to garner popularity,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi. JSP contested 238 seats and failed to win a single seat mustering a poor 3.4% of the votes. The party got less votes than NOTA in 68 constituencies.JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna, amounting to a total of Rs 15,600 crore, during the period when the model code of conduct for election was in force amounted to corrupt practice. Terming the doles as freebies, Singh said Bihar is one of the top five fiscal deficit states, and spending such a huge amount from exchequer without economic planning would further impact its financial health.The SC bench said, ""There is a difference between legal and constitutional questions and fiscal policy. If a governing political party is causing harm to the state through its economic policy, then it is for the people to vote it out.We cannot entertain such petitions. It is an omnibus election petition seeking to annul the entire election.""""You file an election petition for each constituency and prove that because of the corrupt practice the candidate has won. Otherwise, if a candidate has won by a margin of 10,000 votes and there were only 1,000 women who got the dole, why should his election be set aside,"" the bench asked.When the counsel continued to persuade the court to examine the legality and constitutionality of election-eve freebies, the bench said it would seriously examine the issue in the pending petitions but not at the instance of a political party which lost the election badly. ""All political parties indulge in the same freebies game once they come to power,"" the bench said.""Why did you not challenge it when the announcement was made about giving Rs 10,000 to each woman in Bihar by the govt,"" the SC bench said.It told the party to move Patna high court. ""You withdraw the petition and file a petition in the HC. We will have the benefit of HC's view,"" the bench said. JSR withdrew its petition.","JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna amounted to corrupt practice.

What the data says

No gangs, priority to children

Political sparring





NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Friday said claims of a sudden surge in missing girls and children in the capital were being amplified through paid promotions, warning of strict action against those “creating panic for monetary gains”.In two posts on X over the last 24 hours, the police rejected what they called rumour-driven narratives. On Thursday evening, Delhi Police appealed to citizens “not to fall victim to rumours of a sudden rise in cases of missing children”, cautioning that those misrepresenting statistics to spread fear would face legal action.On Friday morning, the force went a step further, saying that after following multiple leads, it had found the “hype” around missing girls being pushed through paid promotion.The police assertion is backed by official data released the same day, which shows that missing-person cases in Delhi have remained largely stable over the past decade, with a marginal decline in recent months.According to Delhi Police, the city recorded a 2% drop in missing-person cases in 2025, a downward trend that has continued into early 2026. In January 2026, 1,777 cases were reported — lower than the 2025 monthly average of 2,042 and slightly below the 1,786 cases recorded in January 2024.Police said Delhi maintains a per-capita missing-person rate of 122.5 per 1,00,000 population, which it claims is lower than comparable figures in the UK and the US. Since 2016, 1,80,805 missing persons have been traced, reflecting a cumulative recovery rate of about 77%.Senior officers stressed that high reporting numbers should not be mistaken for a rise in long-term disappearances. “Delhi follows a digital-first, transparent reporting system. Even short-duration absences — a child delayed from school, a teenager temporarily unreachable due to connectivity issues, or precautionary complaints by anxious parents — are immediately recorded,” an officer said. Many such cases, police added, are resolved within hours but remain on record if families do not formally report the person’s return.The pace of recovery has also accelerated. In 2016, 23,409 people were reported missing, of whom 20,029 were eventually traced — an 85% recovery achieved over nine years. In contrast, 2025 saw 24,508 missing-person reports, with 15,421 traced within the same calendar year itself, indicating a 63% recovery rate in a much shorter time frame. Police said these figures will continue to improve as ongoing investigations conclude.Delhi Police PRO Sanjay Tyagi said there was “no need for fear or panic”, particularly regarding children. “Compared to the past, there has been no increase in missing-person reports in Delhi. In January 2026, there was a drop compared to the same period last year,” Tyagi said in a video message.He emphasised that missing children cases are prioritised under standard operating procedures, with dedicated district-level missing-person squads and the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of the Crime Branch working round the clock. Missing persons can be reported at police stations, online, or through ERSS-112.Importantly, Tyagi said no organised gangs have been found involved in missing children or kidnapping cases in the capital. “We appeal to people not to pay heed to rumours. Appropriate action will be taken against those spreading them,” he said.Officers working on the ground said many recovered children had left home willingly. Senior Constable Monika of the AHTU explained that younger children often go missing because they do not know their address or parents’ contact details, while teenagers are sometimes lured by strangers or influenced by social media. “With technical surveillance and CCTV analysis, we trace such children,” she said.Head Constable Seema Tyagi added that academic pressure, family disputes and personal issues are common triggers among teenagers. “Many provide false details after leaving home. Sometimes families hesitate to report immediately due to fear of social stigma,” she said.The police clarification comes amid a political row after former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal raised concerns over safety, citing reports of 807 missing persons in the first 15 days of 2026.“In Delhi, 807 people have gone missing in just 15 days, most of them women and children. These circumstances are extremely frightening,” Kejriwal posted on X, questioning law and order under BJP rule.Delhi Police, however, maintained that such figures, when seen without context, can be misleading. “Transparent and accessible reporting often leads to higher immediate numbers, but that reflects responsiveness — not a breakdown of safety,” a senior officer said, reiterating that panic-driven narratives, especially those pushed through paid campaigns, would not be tolerated.","Delhi Police rubbishes'missing' girls theory after Arvind Kejriwal raises concern.

Portugal chooses between a moderate and a populist in runoff presidential election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/portugal-chooses-between-a-moderate-and-a-populist-in-runoff-presidential-election/articleshow/128059806.cms,"Presidential candidates Antonio Jose Seguro, of the center-left Socialist Party, right, and Andre Ventura, of the populist Chega party, shake hands before a television debate ahead of the Feb. 8 presidential election, in Lisbon, Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026. (AP Photo/Armando Franca)





LISBON: Center-left Socialist candidate Antonio Jose Seguro is heavily favored to defeat hard-right populist Andre Ventura in Portugal's runoff presidential election Sunday in a vote that will test the depth of support for Ventura's brash style of politics.Recent opinion polls say Seguro will collect twice as many votes as Ventura in the head-to-head between the two top candidates in last month's first round of voting, when none of the runners captured the more than 50% of the vote required for victory.But making it through to the runoff is already a milestone for Ventura and his Chega (Enough) party, which has quickly grown into a significant force in Portuguese politics during a wider European shift to the right.Seguro, a longstanding Socialist politician, has positioned himself as a moderate candidate who will cooperate with Portugal's center-right minority government, repudiating Ventura's anti-establishment and anti-immigrant tirades.In Portugal, the president is largely a figurehead with no executive power. Traditionally, the head of state stands above the political fray, mediating disputes and defusing tensions.However, the president is an influential voice and possesses some powerful tools, being able to veto legislation from parliament, although the veto can be overturned. The head of state also possesses what in Portuguese political jargon is called an ""atomic bomb,"" the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections.In May, Portugal held its third general election in three years in the country's worst bout of political instability for decades, and steadying the ship is a key challenge for the next president.Ventura, an eloquent and theatrical politician, has rejected political accommodation in favor of a more combative stance. One of his main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration, as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years.""Portugal is ours,"" he said.During the campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country saying, ""This isn't Bangladesh"" and ""Immigrants shouldn't be allowed to live on welfare.""Although he founded his party less than seven years ago, its surge in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal's parliament in the May 18 general election.In March, the winner will replace center-right President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the limit of two five-year terms.",Center-left Socialist candidate Antonio Jose Seguro is heavily favored to defeat hard-right populist Andre Ventura.

Fergie’s ‘Secret Epstein Messages’ Ignite Crisis As Expert Warns Of Congress Showdown | WATCH

Crown Princess’s son denies rape charges





Norway’s royal family faced renewed scrutiny this week as charities reviewed or cut ties with Crown Princess Mette-Marit over her past contact with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , while critics questioned her suitability as Norway’s future queen.The Crown Princess issued a “profound apology” to Norwegians after it emerged she had exchanged messages with Epstein for three years.""I also apologise for the situation in which I have placed the Royal House, especially the King and Queen,"" she said in a palace statement.Hundreds of emails exchanged between Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014 were revealed in files released by the US Justice Department last week.Some messages discussed plans to meet in person and showed that the crown princess spent four days at Epstein’s Palm Beach home in Florida while he was reportedly not present.Emails sent in 2012 from “H K H Kronprinsessen” — Norwegian for “Her Royal Highness The Crown Princess”, show Mette-Marit referring to Jeffrey Epstein as “sweetheart” and “soft hearted,” as cited by CNN.In another exchange the same year, she described Epstein as “very charming,” and wrote: “Is it inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my 15-year-old sons wallpaper?”A separate 2012 conversation records Epstein saying he was on a “wife hunt,” adding: “Paris is proving interesting but I prefer scandinavians (sic).”Mette-Marit replied that Paris was “good for adultery” and that “Scandis better wife material.”The tone of the correspondence surprised many in Norway, and the messages indicate she was aware Epstein had served a jail term in 2008. In an October 2011 email, she wrote: “Googled u after last email… Agree didn’t look too good.”The palace initially issued a statement last week in which the crown princess expressed regret and acknowledged “poor judgment”, but it faced pressure to clarify the nature of her relationship with Epstein.In a further statement on Friday, the palace said she was “deeply saddened” that she had not realised earlier what kind of person Epstein was. It added that she wanted to provide a more detailed explanation but was in a “very difficult situation” and needed time to “gather herself.”Another controversy surrounding Norway’s royal family centres on Crown Princess Mette-Marit’s 29-year-old son, Marius Borg Høiby, who broke down in tears during his first day of testimony this week as he denied four counts of rape in an Oslo court.Høiby is not in the line of succession, having been born before Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.Ahead of the trial beginning on Tuesday, Crown Prince Haakon issued a rare statement reaffirming Høiby’s status as a private citizen, saying his stepson was “not a member of the Royal House of Norway and is therefore autonomous.”","Hundreds of emails exchanged between Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014 were revealed in files released by the US Justice Department last week.

As the issue of 'Indian takeover' of Frisco rocked the council meeting Tuesday, pushed by influencers on social media, Frisco council's first Indian-origin member Burt Thakur spoke about the issue and said Indians who came to America upheld American Dream because American Dream needs participation.“Somewhere along the way Indians came to America, and then they became Americans, and then they helped to reinforce the American Dream because the American Dream requires participation,” Thakur said. “People are upset. And I suppose what I’m trying to say to you is this. Look to the left of you and look to the right of you. This is Frisco. … Together we can do amazing things,"" Thakur said as he spoke about the first Indians who came to the US, the Punjabis who settled in California, and Indians who served the US.Dallas Observer reported that a dozen speakers flaunting America First hats spoke at the city council chamber and raged against the alleged H-1B visa and the 'Indian takeover'.

Epstein files fallout: Why UK PM Keir Starmer is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/epstein-files-fallout-why-uk-pm-keir-starmer-is-under-fire/articleshow/127927777.cms,"Epstein files earthquake in US but tremors in UK - Is UK PM Keir Starmer's job under threat? (AP photo)

Mandelson-Epstein Scandal Rocks UK Parliament; Starmer Under Siege Over Russian Spy Claims, Judgment

Leadership challenges add to pressure on Starmer





The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is threatening the political future of a world leader — but not the one many might expect.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure connected to the wider fallout of the case. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. As political tensions grow in Britain, Epstein victims continue to push for further accountability in Washington.The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders. While British institutions focused on scrutiny and accountability are actively probing links tied to the scandal, Trump’s influence over the Justice Department and strong backing within the Republican-controlled Congress have limited political fallout for him. At the same time, the reach of the Epstein files continues to expand globally, with implications now touching countries including Norway and Poland, nearly seven years after Epstein’s death.In the United Kingdom, public anger over any association with Epstein has been intense. King Charles III stripped his brother, former Prince Andrew, of royal titles and removed him from royal duties due to his links with Epstein.In contrast, the United States has not seen similar political or institutional consequences for figures connected to Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges involving underage girls.One of the most prominent figures to face professional consequences was former US treasury secretary Larry Summers. The former Harvard University president stepped back from public roles last year after emails revealed he had exchanged sexist remarks and sought personal advice from Epstein. Summers later said he was “deeply ashamed.”Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to move past renewed scrutiny after the US Department of Justice said there would be no further prosecutions tied to the case. Authorities have not charged Trump or anyone else named in newly released files, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president. Some references to Trump in the documents are routine, while others include newly surfaced, unverified sexual assault allegations and accounts from some Epstein victims describing encounters with the future president.Starmer’s political crisis, however, has deepened. His leadership came under further strain after unrest among Labour Party lawmakers added to ongoing challenges facing his government.During a tense parliamentary session, Starmer acknowledged he was aware of the relationship between former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Epstein before appointing him ambassador to Washington.Starmer dismissed Mandelson last year after earlier Epstein documents showed Mandelson maintained ties with Epstein after his 2008 sex offense conviction in Florida. The controversy intensified this week following newly released files suggesting Mandelson may have shared sensitive, market-moving information with Epstein during the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson is now under criminal investigation and has resigned from both the House of Lords and the Labour Party.“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer told parliament.The political fallout in Britain is being driven not only by Epstein’s crimes but by deeper, ongoing tensions in British politics. Starmer is facing pressure less than two years after winning a landslide election victory, with speculation growing about potential leadership challenges within the Labour Party.British prime ministers face constant internal party pressure in a system where leadership challenges can emerge quickly. The current crisis comes after more than a decade of political instability that saw the UK cycle through multiple prime ministers.The Epstein scandal has also revived scrutiny of Mandelson’s long and controversial political career. Once a key architect of Labour’s transformation in the 1990s alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson helped move the party toward the political center. However, repeated controversies — often linked to his connections with wealthy and influential figures — have overshadowed his legacy.The scandal has also revived debate about the British royal family, particularly Prince Andrew’s association with Epstein and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abuse after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew denied wrongdoing and made no admission of liability or guilt, but the settlement intensified public criticism and contributed to his removal from royal duties.While Epstein-related developments have created turbulence in US politics, they have not posed a direct threat to Trump’s presidency. He has not been accused of any crimes related to the case, though his past association with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.Trump remains politically resilient despite ongoing controversies, from immigration policies to disputes over election integrity. His political strategy often involves overwhelming public discourse with multiple issues simultaneously, reducing the impact of any single controversy.","UK PM Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure.

Tony Hawk has issued a detailed public rebuttal after online speculation claimed one of his weddings took place on a private Caribbean island once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, following the release of a new tranche of US Justice Department documents.The skateboarding icon, 57, addressed the claims directly on Instagram after social media users seized on a third-party tip contained in the files and attempted to connect it to his personal life. Hawk said the allegation was “nonsense”, laid out a verified timeline of his four marriages, and stressed that he had never met Epstein nor visited his island.The confusion stems from an FBI tip referenced in the newly released Epstein-related files. The document summarises a call to the FBI’s tip line, logged by a Threat Intake Examiner at the National Threat Operations Center, in which an unnamed woman alleged she had been exploited as a minor and trafficked to multiple locations, including Little Saint James.In the course of recounting her allegations, the caller claimed she had been on the island “when Prince Edward was there and when Tony Hawk got married on the island”. The document does not present corroboration for that claim and makes clear it reflects the caller’s account. Being named in the files does not indicate wrongdoing, and many entries are unverified tips or third-party statements.Hawk’s name appears three times across the document release. Two of those references relate not to travel or personal associations, but to email discussions about the 2010 video game. The remaining reference is the unverified allegation above, which Hawk says is demonstrably false.Hawk responded via an Instagram Story, writing: “I apologise if they don’t fit a narrative of nonsense,” before listing the locations of each of his weddings:None of those locations overlap with Epstein’s former property in the US Virgin Islands.He said the speculation likely arose from his third wedding in 2006, which took place on Tavarua Island in Fiji. Photographs from that ceremony were later licensed to Getty Images, and the photographer credited on those images is named Mark Epstein.Hawk addressed that point explicitly: “One of the guests in 2006 shot photos of the Fiji ceremony and licensed them to Getty Images. His name is (coincidentally) Mark Epstein.” He added that the photographer is “an accomplished action sports photographer from Wyoming” who is “in no way related” to Jeffrey Epstein.For context, Jeffrey Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, is a New York–based property developer; the shared surname appears to have caused the confusion. “This is all easily verifiable information,” Hawk wrote. “Facts are not fungible.” He apologised to the photographer for being “pulled into the misinformation vortex.”Hawk, a father of four and a household name well beyond skateboarding, concluded by reiterating that he had never visited Epstein’s island and had no personal association with the late financier, underscoring that the claim circulating online collapses under basic fact-checking."," skateboarding icon, 57, addressed the claims directly on Instagram.

UNMISSABLE Testimonies: 'Will Break Your F***ing Window': U.S. Citizens Reveal ICE Horror On Capitol





A heated confrontation at a Minneapolis yoga studio has gone viral after a group of students confronted staff over the removal of an anti-ICE protest sign from the premises.In a video shared on TikTok, around a dozen patrons are seen gathering in the studio lobby after a Sunday class, demanding answers from two female staff members. The exchange was led by longtime member Heather Anderson, who repeatedly pressed employees to explain why the company had not publicly condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the city.“Give us answers… why are you being silent?” Anderson is heard saying in the clip, raising her voice as other customers voiced support. At one point, she urged a staff member to respond “loud and proud,” while accusing the company of failing to take a clear stand.The staffers, identified by the company as a studio manager and a regional director — not corporate executives, appeared visibly uncomfortable during the exchange. One employee told the group, “We’re being berated right now,” a remark that further inflamed tensions.“You’re not being berated, you’re being asked hard questions,” a patron responded, as others demanded to know whether the removed sign would be restored.In a statement, CorePower Yoga confirmed that the original anti-ICE sign had been replaced with standardized signage used across its studios, clarifying that law enforcement or ICE officials may only enter with a valid judicial warrant. The company said it does not condone “violent ICE raids” and emphasized that its studios are intended to be safe and welcoming spaces.Following the incident, memberships of attendees present during the confrontation were temporarily paused as a precaution. The company later reinstated more than half after individual discussions, while Anderson’s membership was fully terminated.Anderson defended her actions in remarks to the New York Post, saying she did not regret how she handled the situation.The episode comes amid heightened tensions in Minneapolis, where anti-ICE protests have intensified in recent weeks. Federal authorities have since announced a reduction in ICE personnel in Minnesota, even as investigations continue into separate protest-related incidents.The viral video has sparked debate online over activism, corporate responsibility, and the boundaries of protest inside private businesses.","A video of a heated confrontation at a Minneapolis yoga studio has gone viral.

No F-22s at the Super Bowl: Why Raptors were dropped from the flyover?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-f-22s-at-the-super-bowl-why-raptors-were-dropped-from-the-flyover/articleshow/128047707.cms,"Kid Rock Or Bad Bunny? Trump’s Preference Shakes Super Bowl Talk





Two F-22 Raptor stealth jets originally slated for the Super Bowl LX flyover were removed due to “operational assignments,” the Air Force announced Friday.Katie Spencer, who helped organise the Department of the Air Force’s sports outreach programmes and coordinated the flyover formation, said the F-22s were part of the original concept but were reassigned as operational demands increased, Independent reported.“We wanted fifth-generation aircraft from the Air Force and fifth-generation aircraft from the Navy,” Spencer said in a Friday interview with The Military Times. “But as things happen in our military, operational tempo has increased, and so the F-22s got pulled for some operational assignments.”Iranian aircraft failed to intercept the US military, and Iran’s air-defence systems failed to spot the stealth aircraft involved in the mission. In the lead-up to the operation, roughly 10 F-22s, along with other US fighters such as F-35s and F-16s, were deployed to the Middle East to support the strike and provide air dominance if needed, according to The National Interest.More recently, in January and early February, a mix of US aircraft conducted strikes on ISIS targets in Syria during an operation known as Hawkeye Strike.Even for the aircraft approved to take part in the Super Bowl flyover, Spencer said the event served a practical military purpose beyond ceremony.As defence officials said in previous years, flyovers doubled as training exercises and did not require additional taxpayer funding.“These flyovers serve as time-over-target training for our crews,” Spencer said. “They serve as recovery efforts with our maintainers. And so the reason that we are so proficient at operations like Midnight Hammer and other things that you’ll see is because we can replicate those real-world scenarios with this type of flying.”The revised flyover for Super Bowl LX will feature aircraft representing 250 years of American airpower. Scheduled to pass over the stadium are two Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, two Air National Guard F-15C Eagles, a pair of Navy F/A-18E Super Hornets and two F-35C Lightning II fighters from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.“Our Guard members have stepped in to fill that role, and we’re super grateful for that,” Spencer said.The Super Bowl LX kickoff is set for Sunday at 6:30 p.m. EST.","Two F-22 Raptor stealth jets originally slated for the Super Bowl LX flyover were removed due to “operational assignments,” the Air Force announced Friday.

A skier died Thursday after a catastrophic fall on one of Mammoth Mountain’s steepest expert runs, with the accident unfolding in full view of stunned onlookers riding a nearby chairlift. The incident marks the fourth death at the popular California ski resort this season.The unidentified skier was attempting Dropout 2, a notorious double-black-diamond trail that plunges nearly 1,200 vertical feet from the 11,000-foot summit ridge.Regarded as one of the steepest marked runs in the state, the slope is visible from Chair 23, which transports advanced skiers to some of the mountain’s most extreme terrain.Witnesses said the skier fell near the top of the icy, heavily moguled run, lost both skis and slid headfirst down the slope for hundreds of yards as horrified bystanders watched helplessly from above.“Looked like he lost skis high in deep moguls,” one eyewitness wrote on Reddit, calling it the “worst thing I’ve ever seen on the mountain.”Mammoth Mountain confirmed that ski patrol rushed to the scene and administered life-saving care before the skier was transported to paramedics. Despite the efforts, the guest succumbed to injuries, the resort said in a statement.The tragedy comes days after another alarming incident at Mammoth, where a 12-year-old girl survived a terrifying fall after dangling from a ski lift. Authorities have not yet released the identity of the deceased skier.","A skier died Thursday after a catastrophic fall on one of Mammoth Mountain's steepest expert runs.

Family seeks justice





The stepbrother of 18-year-old Anna Kepner has been arrested and charged in connection with her death, nearly three months after the Florida teen was found dead aboard a Carnival Cruise ship, according to reports.Federal authorities had been investigating the mysterious circumstances surrounding how Anna ended up hidden under a bed inside her family’s cabin during a Caribbean voyage last November.The FBI, which has been leading the probe, reportedly arrested the 16-year-old stepbrother this week. Because he is a minor, the specific charges against him have not been made public and court records remain sealed.He is understood to have appeared before a federal judge in closed proceedings. Officials have declined to comment further due to the juvenile status of the accused and the ongoing investigation.Anna, a cheerleader from Central Florida, was travelling with her grandparents, father, stepmother, siblings and stepsiblings on a Carnival Cruise ship sailing from Florida to Mexico when tragedy struck.On the morning of November 7, she was found dead in the family’s cabin. According to investigative sources, her body was discovered under a bed, wrapped in a blanket and covered with life vests.Her death was later ruled a homicide. The death certificate listed the cause as “mechanical asphyxia,” indicating she had been suffocated. Reports have stated there were bruises on her body, but no signs of sexual assault and no alcohol or drugs in her system.In the weeks following Anna’s death, her stepbrother had been identified as a “suspect” in a court filing related to an unrelated custody case. He was previously taken into custody and released to the supervision of a guardian.The recent arrest and charging mark the first major breakthrough in the high-profile case.Anna’s grieving parents have previously described her death as “violent and senseless” and expressed anguish that the person responsible had not yet been fully held accountable.With the arrest now confirmed, the legal process is set to move forward — though much of it may remain shielded from public view due to the accused’s age.The investigation remains active, and further details are expected to emerge as proceedings continue.","The FBI, which has been leading the probe, reportedly arrested the 16-year-old stepbrother this week.

Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

'Physically handicapped': Khawaja Asif's brutal admission as Pakistan forces battle BLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/physically-handicapped-khawaja-asifs-brutal-admission-as-pakistan-forces-battling-bla-in-balochistan/articleshow/127880579.cms,"Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Driving the news

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike. Officials say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades.

At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province, officials said on Saturday.

The coordinated gun and suicide attacks are being carried out across Balochistan, mainly in Quetta, Pasni, Mastung, Nushki and Gwadar districts,"" news agency AFP reported, quoting a senior security official based in the provincial capital Quetta.The official talking about the death toll further added, ""seventy terrorists have been eliminated... Ten security personnel were martyred while a few others were injured"", he spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""At least four policemen were killed in Quetta alone.""According to the reports, the Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attacks. The rebel group said that they aimed to target military installations and police and civil administration officials.With this attack, the group has declared the second phase of ""Operation Herof"", news agency ANI reported, citing The Balochistan Post (TBP). BLA had earlier stated about their plans to launch a new phase to ""protect the motherland.""Following the insurgent incident, security in the region has been ramped up. Emergency teams have been deployed in multiple cities.No reports of civilian casuality has been reported by the officials as of now.Confirming the attack, a senior official stated that the attack was ""coordinated but poorly executed."" He also said that the insurgents could not inflict damage due to the swift security response.""The attacks failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under an effective security response.""The situation is yet to get under control, as per the reports.For decades, Pakistan has faced a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, where rebels have repeatedly targeted security forces, foreign nationals, and people from outside the region.","At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

As Bangladesh Elections Near, Hindu Minority Faces Rising Attacks, Islamist Return And State Silence





A veteran Bangladesh politician, Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.Sen, 83, reportedly became unwell inside the jail early Saturday morning and was taken to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at around 9:29 am local time, according to prison officials. Jail Superintendent Farhad Sarkar said the body would be handed over to his family once all legal procedures have been completed, as reported by ANI.His death, only days before the country’s general election scheduled for February 12, has heightened concerns over the treatment of incarcerated political leaders and renewed allegations of custodial negligence. Organising Secretary of Bangladesh Awami League Central Committee Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, alleging negligence and calling out Yunus said on X, ""Ramesh Chandra Sen from a teacher to a politician and a public representative. A five-time MP and former minister—this elderly, ill man was arrested and led away with his hands tied. He has now passed away in Dinajpur jail due to a lack of medical treatment. Yunus, you must answer for this.""President of Bangladesh Students' League Saddam Hussein also claimed medical neglect saying, ""Eighteen months ago, this widely respected, elderly leader was attacked, humiliated by BNP-Jamaat mob and taken into police custody, without any specific charges.One false and fabricated case after another was imposed on him to justify his continued detention. Despite his deteriorating health, he was deliberately denied bail, denied minimum medical treatment, and denied basic human rights. "" ""At 86 years of age, Sri Ramesh Chandra Sen was kept behind bars for one and a half years without trial and without proper medical care. This happened under the illegal, murderous-fascist Yunus regime, which chose cruelty over humanity and repression over the rule of law,"" he added.Further mentioning other Awami League politicians in custody he added, ""According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 107 prisoners died in custody in 2025 alone—the majority of them leaders and activists of the Awami League. In almost every case, the authorities casually cited causes such as “heart attack” or “sudden illness.” Despite clear legal provisions, not a single custodial death has been properly investigated by this illegal government. ""The veteran Hindu leader had been in custody since August 16, 2024, after being arrested by police in Thakurgaon. ""Bangladesh Police have arrested a Hindu leader of Awami League and put him on a farcical trial. Ramesh Chandra Sen, an octogenarian, was arrested from his house in Thakurgaon who was having his dinner. Surprisingly, he hails from Mirza Fakhrul's constituency,"" the Bangladesh Awami League had said, just days after his arrest nearly two years ago.A court subsequently ordered his transfer to Thakurgaon District Jail and later to Dinajpur. There, he was facing three cases, including a murder charge linked to the political turmoil that followed a mass uprising against the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Born on April 30, 1940, in Ruhia Union under Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila, Sen was elected multiple times from the Thakurgaon-1 constituency to the Jatiya Sangsad. A presidium member of the Awami League, he secured his most recent parliamentary victory in the 2024 general election, before the party was later barred from political activity by the current interim administration.Meanwhile, the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and tasked with overseeing the electoral process for February 12 elections, has faced criticism at home and abroad over its human rights record. Opposition figures contend that deaths of prominent detainees, particularly former Awami League leaders, point to systemic failings and raise concerns about the adequacy of medical care in custody.His death comes at a politically sensitive moment in Bangladesh, with the Awami League excluded from the forthcoming polls and rival parties competing for advantage.","Bangladesh Awami League senior leader Ramesh Chandra Sen died on Saturday while in custody at Dinajpur District Jail.
