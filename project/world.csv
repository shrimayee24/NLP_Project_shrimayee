Xi Jinping urges Macron to help China to avoid a ‘new cold war’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-urges-macron-to-help-china-to-avoid-a-new-cold-war/articleshow/109900723.cms,"Cognac threat

Chinese President Xi Jinping called on France to help fend off a “new Cold War” as the European Union increasingly aligns with US concerns over security risks and trade tensions.He told French President Emmanuel Macron the two nations should uphold mutual benefits, and jointly oppose decoupling and the disruption of supply chains, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing comments made during talks between the two leaders on Monday.Xi is in Paris on a state visit before heading to Serbia and Hungary in his first trip to the bloc in five years. He is hoping to convince Europeans that Beijing offers an economic opportunity despite warnings from officials in Washington about the risks.The EU and China have found themselves at odds on multiple fronts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and international commerce. Distrust toward Beijing in Brussels is growing, shown by a recent flurry of arrests of alleged Chinese spies and a salvo of trade probes. And China’s declaration of a “no limits” friendship with Moscow has helped Russia weather unprecedented sanctions imposed by the US and its allies.Macron reiterated that there cannot be security in Europe without security in Ukraine.“We are at a historical turning point where threats are at an unprecedented level and the risks of global fragmentation are considerable,” Macron said, sitting alongside his Chinese counterpart at a business conference in the French capital.Xi said the conflict could only be resolved through negotiations involving both sides and warned against using it as a tool to criticize China.“We oppose this crisis being used to place responsibility on a third country, tarnish its image and incite a new cold war ,” Xi said.Painful shortages in weapons and manpower along the 1,200-kilometer (930-mile) front, along with a dire need for more air defense systems, have piled pressure on Ukraine’s fighting forces, raising the risk of a Russian breakthrough. Moscow has escalated its barrages of missile and drone attacks, decimating swathes of Ukrainian power-generating infrastructure and destroying residential buildings in city centers.Macron and Xi called for a worldwide ceasefire during the Olympic Games that start in Paris in late July.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who joined the talks earlier on Monday, said after the meeting that the EU is prepared to deploy all the tools available to defend its economies if China fails to offer fair access to its markets.The EU is becoming tougher on trade relations with China, echoing US concerns about state-fueled overcapacity in green industry. That rhetorical shift was already put into practice with the launch of a probe into subsidies for Chinese electric vehicles in the fall of 2023. The bloc followed up last month with a separate investigation into procurement of medical devices.France has been a key champion of the EU’s firmer approach. In a speech last month laying out his vision for Europe’s future, Macron called for the EU to do more to echo subsidies in the US and introduce preferences for its homegrown industry in strategic sectors including artificial intelligence and green tech.Still, Macron insisted that the EU is forging its own path to protect it from unfair competition regardless of its origin.“Nobody dictates our trade, economic and technology policy,” he said. “We wish it to be sovereign, which means independent.”For its part, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into liquor products, a move that could hurt France’s cognac producers disproportionately. More broadly, it has denied generating overcapacity and accuses the EU of protectionism.According to Xinhua, Xi reiterated that position in talks with Macron and von der Leyen, saying there is no capacity issue viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand.The purpose of face-to-face meetings is to try to bridge some of the differences between countries, and Macron expressed some hope for progress on trade issues.“I also thank the president for his openness on the provisional measures on French cognac and wish to see them not applied,” he said.To mark Xi’s visit, Macron gave him some cognac, including from luxury giant LVMH and Remy Cointreau SA, among other gifts.Xi added that China will extend short-term visa exemption for French citizens until the end of next year.","Xi is in Paris on a state visit before heading to Serbia and Hungary.

"2 minor rape survivors from Hyderabad clear SSC, goal is to become police officers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/teen-rape-survivors-clear-class-x-aim-to-join-police-force/articleshow/109895282.cms,"TOI

HYDERABAD: They live with invisible, indelible scars in their minds, yet they’ve proved to be on their mettle. Both are rape survivors from Hyderabad — aged 16 and 17. They recently cleared the Class X exams and are determined to pursue careers as police officers to help victims of various forms of violence.The 16-year-old, who is from SC community, scored 5.2 GPA, while the other girl secured an impressive 9.3.What truly counts are not grades, but the internal battles they’ve overcome to rediscover hope for the future.The younger of the two, raped by her father, delivered a child a few months before the exams. Although strong-willed, she held back tears while talking to. She said she did not understand what her father was doing to her and she could not tell anyone as he had threatened her and her mother with dire consequences. In Jan 2023, she had stomach cramps and doctors confirmed her pregnancy.What followed was a rabbit hole of tests, cops asking questions, and legal issues. Her father claimed he had been falsely implicated. But the DNA test called his bluff.Despite all these, the survivor returned to school. “She had little to prepare for the exams… might have spent a month on preparations,” her maternal uncle said.The court sentenced her father to life imprisonment and also awarded Rs 15 lakh compensation to her. “Speak out and call out anybody who is troubling you, else you will be blamed,” the girl said.The 17-year-old was raped by her uncle and the case was reported in 2022. “After we got the accused arrested, the entire family turned against us. I wonder if we will go through such a situation again,” the girl said. When her exam results were declared and she scored 9.3 GPA, she found herself inundated with calls from the very people who had shamed her, said the girl whose court trial is ongoing.“In addition to education, we need to have the courage to speak out about violence and call out accused,” she said. “We have seen how cops handled our cases and it inspired us to aim to become police officers. We want to help others like us and get them justice.”","The 16-year-old, who is from SC community, scored 5.2 GPA, while the other girl secured an impressive 9.3.

Al Jazeera calls Israeli crackdown 'criminal act'

(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Israeli army carried out air strikes on areas in eastern Rafah near neighborhoods that received evacuation orders, as reported by Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV. Israel issued evacuation notices to civilians in parts of southern Gaza on Monday, signaling an impending assault on Hamas strongholds in the city.Palestinian families, informed of the evacuation via Arabic text messages, telephone calls, and flyers, gathered outside despite chilly rain.Israeli forces directed Palestinians to relocate to an ""expanded humanitarian zone"" located 20 kilometers away from the targeted areas.While Israel's military initiated what it termed as a ""limited scope"" operation to encourage Rafah residents to evacuate, it did not specify reasons or hint at any forthcoming offensive actions.The evacuation call coincides with renewed talks of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, scheduled to resume on Monday. However, tensions persist as both sides remain at odds over ceasefire terms amid the seven-month-long conflict.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Sunday that yielding to demands to end the war would equate to defeat. Netanyahu emphasized Israel's resolve not to allow Hamas to regain control of Gaza, rebuild its military infrastructure, or pose a threat to Israeli citizens.""Israel will not agree to Hamas's demands, which mean surrender, and will continue the fighting until all its goals are achieved,"" stated Netanyahu, as conveyed in a statement from his office.Gaza civil defence and aid officials said Monday that Israeli jets struck two areas in eastern Rafah the Israeli military had ordered to be evacuated, ahead of a possible ground invasion of the Palestinian city.""The areas targeted by the Israeli occupation are near the perimeter of Gaza International Airport, the Al-Shuka area, the Abu Halawa area, the Salaheddin street area and the Salam neighbourhood,"" Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Ahmed Ridwan told AFP. Another aid official confirmed the strikes.The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment, but earlier on Sunday it ordered residents of Al-Shuka and Al-Salam to evacuate and move to a humanitarian area.Osama al-Kahlut from the emergency operations department of the Red Crescent Society told AFP that the bombing was targeting eastern areas of Rafah.""It is clear that it is targeting homes, but we have not received any communications or information about the presence of victims in the targeted areas,"" he said.Eastern Rafah resident Yaqub al-Sheikh Salama, 30, said the bombing was intense in Al-Salam, Al-Shuka, and other areas.""There are massive explosions and terrifying sounds of aerial and artillery bombardments,"" Salam told AFP.""Children and women are scared and don't know where to go,"" he said.Reacting to Netanyahu's statement, Qatar-based Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh accused the Israeli PM of sabotaging the talks.A Hamas official said Sunday the group's delegation for Gaza truce talks was headed to Doha for ""consultations"" after the last round of talks in Cairo failed to produce a breakthrough.Hamas negotiators are then due back in Cairo on Tuesday, said Al-Qahera News, a site linked to Egyptian intelligence services.Israeli air strikes continued to pound Rafah in southern Gaza, where about 12 lakh Palestinians have sought shelter. Sunday bombings in the southern strip killed at least 16 people, hours after Hamas rockets eliminated three Israeli soldiers.Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians.Residents of the southern Gaza city said they feared an upsurge in violence if truce talks collapse.Naja Shaat, 59, said she was ""extremely joyful"" when she thought a ceasefire was imminent, ""but today... we are on pins and needles"".The Palestinian civilian toll has strained ties between Israel and its main military supplier and ally the United States. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that ""the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas"".Negotiators met in Egypt's Cairo on Sunday in the absence of the Israeli delegation. In the meeting, Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators proposed a 40-day pause in the fighting and an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain.Any truce reached would be the first since a week-long November ceasefire saw a hostage-prisoner swap.As millions of people have pinned hope on truce talk success, Netanyahu faces protests demanding a truce deal to bring Gaza hostages back home. Protestors, some carrying posters with images of the captives, gathered in Tel Aviv on Sunday, as Israel marked national Holocaust Remembrance Day.Israel on Sunday announced its decision to close Qatar-based news channel Al Jazeera's operation in the country. The network went off-air a short time later.Lashing out at the Netanyahu dispensation's decision, Al Jazeera condemned Israel's action as a ""criminal act"", and said it would take legal action.The extreme step came amid Al Jazeera's round-the-clock coverage of the war, which Israel says is one-sided.","Israeli army carried out air strikes on areas in eastern Rafah near neighborhoods that received evacuation orders.

NEW DELHI: The trial of Kazakhstan’s former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has shocked the nation, with thousands calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence .CCTV footage depicted the minister dragging his wife by her hair, and subsequently punching and kicking her. Following the recorded incident, Nukenova succumbed to brain trauma.The footage, spanning eight hours, also captured Bishimbayev breaking down a door as Nukenova attempted to seek refuge in a bathroom.Nukenova, aged 31, was discovered dead in November within a restaurant owned by one of Bishimbayev’s relatives. Initially denying involvement, Bishimbayev confessed in court on Wednesday to assaulting her and inadvertently causing her demise.Bishimbayev's legal team contested medical evidence suggesting Nukenova died from repeated head trauma . They attempted to portray her as prone to jealousy and violence, despite no evidence from the restaurant's security cameras showing her attacking Bishimbayev.Bishimbayev, 44 years old, once celebrated as a modern, Western-educated figure within the Kazakhstani government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was incarcerated for bribery in 2018. He was later granted a pardon, less than two years into his sentence.A 2018 study supported by UN Women revealed approximately 400 women in Kazakhstan die annually due to domestic violence, with many cases going unreported.In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized certain forms of domestic violence, categorizing them as causing ""minor"" physical damage, punishable by fines or brief imprisonment. This move mirrored Russia's actions that year, provoking outrage among advocates for women’s rights. Kazakhstan has since reversed this legislation, intensifying penalties for offenders and introducing new criminal charges, including harassment of minors.","Kuandyk Bishimbayev is on trial for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova.

However, the university will proceed with smaller school-based ceremonies scheduled for this week and next, according to a statement released by university officials on Monday.The decision to cancel the university-wide ceremony on May 15 was made after discussions with students and considering their feedback.University officials said, ""Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families."" The focus will now shift to Class Days and school-level graduation ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers.The past few weeks have been described as ""incredibly difficult"" for the Columbia University community. The cancellation of the large ceremony comes in the wake of ongoing protests, including more than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who were arrested last month after camping out on Columbia's green.Similar protests have taken place at universities across the country, as schools grapple with maintaining safe and inclusive campuses while allowing for free expression. The University of Southern California (USC) recently canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to proceed. At USC, students abandoned their camp after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.The protests are rooted in the conflict that began on October 7, when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel. The ensuing violence has resulted in casualties on both sides, with significant civilian loss of life. The situation remains complex and sensitive, with ongoing efforts to address the underlying issues and achieve a peaceful resolution.",Columbia University cancels its large university-wide commencement ceremony.

Additionally, two temples upstate and one on Long Island were targeted. The New York Landmarks Conservancy also received a similar threat.These threats occur during a period of increased antisemitism in New York City and beyond. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been demonstrating in the streets and setting up anti-Israeli encampments on college campuses, including Columbia University and City College, in recent weeks.US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Sunday announced that $400 million in federal assistance would be earmarked to protect houses of worship by funding security guards, cameras and barriers.“Last night’s bomb threats targeting New York City synagogues created immense fear, but sadly, these threats are not a total shock given the rise in antisemitism that we have seen and the overall spike in threats to places of worship,” Schumer said in a statement.“Protecting our nonprofit community spaces, like our synagogues, mosques, churches and more has unfortunately demanded more help at the federal level as the threats have increased,” he said. “These funds are to help lessen the unease across the city in the places where we worship, pray, and learn.”According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were 8,873 antisemitic incidents in the US last year, marking a 140% increase from the 2022 figure.The number surged after October 7, following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists, which prompted a significant retaliatory response from Israel in the Gaza Strip.After October 7, there were 5,204 recorded antisemitic incidents.

It comes as the Biden administration and Israeli officials remain at odds over Israel's planned military incursion in Rafah.Biden last met King Abdullah at the White House in February and the two longtime allies discussed a daunting list of challenges, including a looming Israeli ground offensive in southern Gaza and the threat of a humanitarian calamity among Palestinian civilians.

You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country.

'Borrowing water'

Zay Yar Tun fills his truck with water for delivery to refugees in the parched hills of war-ravaged eastern Myanmar, where a heatwave is adding to the misery of life in displacement camps.Under a roof of plastic sheets in one of the camps in Kayah state, Augusta waits for the 10 gallons that must cover her family's drinking, cooking and washing needs for the next three days.More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah by the conflict unleashed by the military's 2021 coup, according to the United Nations .Now, a heatwave that has sent the mercury in Myanmar to 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in some places has added to uncertainties of life in the camps.""Last year, we got water from a spring nearby,"" Augusta told AFP.""But now we can't get water from that place as there is no water left there.""We have to be frugal... If we don't shower today, maybe tomorrow we can wash our hands and faces.""The scarcity means she and her children are often unable to wash properly or clean their clothes in the baking heat.""The children are itching and they seem dirty, and we also don't have clean clothes for them,"" she said.A dozen or so camp residents queue up at the truck for water rations that will have to last them three or four days.Children carry the containers home in baskets on their backs or via trolleys as hot wind whips up dust from the dirt road.""When there were only residents living in this place, there was enough water,"" said Zay Yar Tun, of the charity Clean Yangon.""But after the displaced people fled here, the population is too much for the amount of water we can get here.""Donations keep Zay Yar Tun's team and its two trucks running, and they make two deliveries to the camp each week.Finding the streams or springs to fill up their truck can be dangerous in Kayah, which has emerged as one of the hotspots of resistance to military rule.The military regularly calls in air and artillery strikes on its opponents and landmines are a constant danger.Transporting cargo to the camps is difficult too.The fuel the team needs to run their trucks and pumps is expensive because of military restrictions on importing fuel into Kayah, Zay Yar Tun said.""The price of fuel is very expensive, and it seems like we are exchanging fuel to get water,"" he said.Families like Augusta's are forced to make similar calculations as they try to get through the heat.""If we are going to take a bath in the creek, we have to go far away from the camp,"" she said.""It's not a walkable distance under this temperature.""""If we go by motorcycle, it's not worth it because of the cost of fuel. If we save money for fuel, we may as well use it to buy water.""Respite in the form of the rainy season may be some way off yet.Myanmar's weather office has forecast that the monsoon, which usually begins around May, is likely to arrive late this year, state media reported this week.Until then, water will be priceless in the camp, said Augusta.""Sometimes we say to each other: 'I haven't got any water left, have you got any? Please could you give me some?'"" she said.""Our life has come to this, where we have to borrow water.""","More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah state.

The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed.
