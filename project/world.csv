17-year-old Assam trans girl loses school seat over bikini pictures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/17-year-old-assam-trans-girl-loses-school-seat-over-bikini-pictures/articleshow/111387610.cms,"My girl child, born in a male body, didn't choose this life of struggle where she is being bullied and hated for who she is... the recent incident at her school in Assam has shaken the core of our faith in institutions meant to protect and nurture our young... The school, which should be a sanctuary of learning, became an arena of judgment... This is the plight of my daughter, a plight shared by many, often silenced by the shadows of ignorance.These are excerpts from a letter to Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma by a Guwahati woman after photos of her 17-year-old transgender daughter in a swimming pool in a bikini, posted on her social media platform, forced her to leave the school last month.While the mother has slammed the principal of the reputed co-educational school in Guwahati for ""slandering"", ""belittling"" and ""mocking"" her daughter and ""targeting her truth and her very being"", school authorities said the photographs ""expressed vulgarity"" and all that they had asked for was to have the posts removed from social media.As the world celebrated June as Pride Month, photos of the transgender girl in a bikini, clicked during a family vacation on June 9 and posted on social media, became not just a flashpoint between the school and her family but also put a question mark on the issue of gender inclusivity in educational institutions in India.The family has asked Sarma for a slew of changes - from embracing diversity with gender-inclusive uniform in schools to extending protection against bullying and harassment.Also, the state's Transgender Welfare Board has moved Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (ASCPCR), saying ""nobody can sexualise a child's body and a photo"".On June 26, ASCPCR began hearings in the case, with the transgender girl's family narrating the incident. ""We heard the complainant and would now summon school authorities. After hearing both the parties, we would convene on a specific date. Thereafter, legal action would be initiated,"" commission chairperson Shyamal Prasad Saikia said.On June 10, a day after the transgender girl posted the photos, the school principal called the parents at 9pm. ""'Your daughter is disgusting and shameful. Come tomorrow and take her out of my school...' this is what the principal told me,"" the student's mother recounted the call.The family opted for a transfer from the school rather than what they said was ""capitulating to infringement on her right to exist"".School management said they have taken care of the 17-year-old student and counselled her throughout besides protecting her from bullying by some students.The principal said after she posted the photographs in swimsuit ""expressing vulgarity"", the school earned a ""bad name"" among academia and that the school could not tolerate ""such behaviour"". He said the school never intended to target her and had merely asked her to remove the posts.However, the student's family hurled allegations at the school, saying the issue of bikini photos was an excuse to get her out of school. They alleged that she became a target because of her gender. ""The school doesn't find similar photos posted by boys disgusting or shameful. It indicates their sick mentality,"" the mother said.In the letter to Assam CM, which later went viral on social media, the student's mother said, ""My daughter, with dreams as vast as the Brahmaputra, has faced the heights of discrimination and prejudice. Yet, she stands unwavering, aspiring to contribute to society...""""The phone call at night from the principal was a stark reminder of the battles we still face. Her social media, a space of personal expression, was scrutinised and slandered. A family pool outing, a moment of innocent joy, was twisted into a weapon of shame just because my daughter wore a bikini,"" the letter said.""We asked for a transfer certificate from the school after she was shamed and subjected to mental harassment. We decided to keep her away from such a toxic environment,"" her mother said, adding that the family wants a public apology from the school. Now, she might have to forfeit an entire academic year as she was issued the transfer certificate amid the ongoing session.State Transgender Welfare Board president Rituparna Neog said, ""In the explanation given to us, the school's view is that the photos were sexually explicit. I have forwarded this to ASCPCR, with the point that nobody can sexualise a child's body and photos."" Neog is also a member of the National Council for Transgender Persons.The principal told TOI that the message was clearly communicated to the family. ""Body piercing, tattooing are against our rules. Posting obscene photos on social media is not desired. We told them they could delete the photos and start behaving properly or withdraw the student from the school,"" he said.""I am delighted that transgenders will now raise their voice for liberty and fairness. They glanced at my photos but failed to acknowledge my academic achievements,"" said the student, who passed class X with 76% aggregate.","A 17-year-old transgender girl posted photos of herself in a bikini on social media.

Political reaction

NEW DELHI: A disturbing video has surfaced on social media, showing a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.The assault, captured in the video, showed the woman being repeatedly struck until she was barely conscious and unable to resist. Shockingly, onlookers present at the scene do not intervene to help the victims.The video, shared widely on social media platforms, drew condemnation from political figures including BJP's Amit Malviya and CPI(M)'s Mohammed Salim.They criticized the safety of women under the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal , identifying the assailant as a local TMC leader nicknamed 'JCB' allegedly named Tajemul by the CPI(M) state secretary.Following the brutal assault on the woman, Tajemul is also seen in the video assaulting another man who was lying on the ground. Some people from the crowd reportedly assisted in making the man kneel so that Tajemul could continue his attack.Reports suggest that the incident occurred during an 'Insaf Sabha' organized by Tajemul, reminiscent of a Taliban-style 'quick justice' forum. The meeting allegedly convened to address allegations of an extramarital affair involving the victims, who were also fined as part of the so-called arbitration.Local sources cited by TV9 Bangla identified the woman as a married resident of the village, accused of having an extramarital affair with the man assaulted alongside her. The victims reportedly did not receive immediate medical attention after the assault.West Bengal Police have taken action in the case. Islampur Police Superintendent Joby Thomas K confirmed PTI that the police have registered a case upon verifying the video circulating on social media.""We have initiated raids to apprehend the perpetrator and are swiftly investigating the motive behind this reprehensible act,"" Joby Thomas K said.The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties BJP and CPI(M) accusing the TMC of orchestrating what they describe as ""bulldozer justice"" under chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's administration.BJP's social media head Malviya condemned the incident, highlighting broader concerns about law and order under the TMC regime.He said, “India must wake up to the reality of Sharia Courts in TMC run West Bengal. There is a Sandeshkhali in every village and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a curse for women. There is no semblance of law and order in Bengal. Will Mamata Banerjee act against this monster or defend him like she stood up for Sheikh Shahjahan?”He called on the National Commission for Women (NCW) to intervene and criticized Mamata Banerjee for what he described as systemic issues of governance in West Bengal.CPI(M) West Bengal state secretary Mohammed Salim echoed these sentiments, criticizing the state government for failing to uphold justice and women's safety. He referred to the incident as worse than a ""Kangaroo Court"" scenario, demanding accountability from the administration.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also weighed in on a separate incident, condemning an alleged assault on a minority woman in Cooch Behar. ""Attacks on women, irrespective of their caste, are unacceptable... Elections have been held, results have been declared, and the ruling party has won the maximum seats in the state, so why is the government resorting to violence in the state? Nowhere in the country are we seeing such cases as are seen in Bengal after the elections? No one has the right to exercise violence against women,"" Chowdhury said.Local TMC MLA Hamidur Rahman, however, has distanced himself from the accused, characterizing the incident as a local matter unrelated to the party.TMC district president Kaniyalal Agarwal attributed the assault to disapproval within the community regarding the couple's alleged relationship. He said the alleged illicit relationship ""did not go down well with the villagers"".TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen condemned the incident but also pointed out that such kangaroo courts were common during the Left Front regime too.","A video shows a man mercilessly thrashing a woman with a bundle of bamboo sticks in public view.

PANAJI: Goa police have said in a report to the state chief secretary that they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family in order to help Mumbai resident Pooja Sharma, a senior intelligence officer's wife, get the property vacated , reported.Besides instructing them to not take any action against Pooja, the report said the DGP threatened Anjuna police officers that if the ""demolition work"" was not allowed to continue they would have to ""face the consequences"".The report said when Anjuna police tried to stop the demolition, ""the DGP started shouting"" and said it should be demolished at any cost. He also instructed them that ""if any person is obstructing the demolition they should be brought to the police station"".In a chronology of events that transpired on June 22, the report said at 2.32pm, Anjuna police got a call from Panaji police control room that a person needs their help as “some persons are demolishing his house near Ganga tiles factory at Assagao”.Anjuna police sub-inspectors (PSIs) Sanket Pokhare and Nitin Naik rushed to the spot and found an excavator was demolishing the house — ground plus one floor. Pradeep Agarwadekar and his family, who were present on the spot, claimed that they were inside the house when they started demolishing.“Pokhare told the people to stop the demolition work, while asking the Agarwadekars to produce the documents of the house. He also directed the excavator operator to bring the vehicle to the police station,” the report said.While Anjuna police were carrying out their duty, they got a call from the DGP, “asking why the work of demolition of the house has been stopped”. When he was apprised about the situation, the report said, he got angry and said, “there was nobody inside the house when the demolition work was going as he has personally verified it”.The report said the DGP was pressurising Anjuna police to “take the occupants of the house to the police station and to allow the demolition work to continue”. Instead, Anjuna police instructed the Agarwadekars to come to the station and lodge a complaint.Pradeep Agarwadekar’s wife Prinsha along with her daughter came to the police station, while her husband and son stayed back at the site.The report said while they were at the police station, a person Arshad Khawaja came and told police that he was demolishing the house “as per the instructions from the top officer”. He told them that they would have received a phone call from the top officer.Khawaja also told them that he had received instructions to start the work again and said they could get in touch with him if they had any doubts. “Khawaja shared his mobile number.”The owner of the excavator, Ashley Rodrigues, also went to the police station and said Khawaja had told him that he has “contacts with top officials and that he (Khawaja) will manage all things on the spot”.The DGP called Anjuna police again and directed that “anyhow the work of demolition of the house must take place and no one should stop the work… to allow Arshad Khawaja to continue demolishing the house”.The Anjuna police report also said DGP Singh told them “Pooja Sharma is the owner of the property, and no cognisable offence is made out into the complaint of Prinsha Agarwadekar. Hence, there is no need to take action on her (Prinsha's) complaint”.","Goa police say they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family.

KURUKSHETRA: Baba Gurwinder Singh , head of Gurdwara Udasin Braham Akhara Sahib, Mandi in Pehowa area of Kurukshetra district, apologised in writing to Akal Takht , after his photos of attending an event of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) went viral on social media.In his written apology addressed to Jathedar of Akal Takht, Baba Gurwinder Singh said, “Unknowingly, I went to a school programme at Kurukshetra Haryana on June 23, 2024, we were taken there after being misled.Upon reaching there, I came to know that it was a programme of RSS.I have no relation with them.”“I and our entire Asthan (place) is dedicated to Sri Akal Takht Sahib. I will not do any such act in future, which hurts the Panth. Treating me as a humble Sikh, kindly forgive me for the mistake done unknowingly. Whenever Sri Akal Takht Sahib orders, I will be present there”, said Baba Gurwinder Singh.As per the information, RSS had organised the concluding function of Sangh Shiksha Varg (training camp) in Kurukshetra on June 23, in which, Baba Gurwinder Singh was invited as the chief guest. In a video of his address at an RSS event , Baba Gurwinder Singh is heard motivating the camp participants in light of the Sikh history.However, some photos of Baba Gurwinder Singh participating in the RSS event and taking pledge on the stage with his hand raised to the chest level, went viral on the social media. A number of Sikh social media users started condemning Baba Gurwinder Singh for participating in RSS functions, and his photos went viral.Notably, in July 2004, Akal Takht had issued a message to Sikh community to be cautious of anti-Panth agenda of RSS and its Sikh wing Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, in context with ‘Sarab Sanjhi Gurbani Yatra’ called by RSS terming it as(pomposity) with motive to weaken the Sikh Panth and infiltrate. It was also said in the Akal Takht message that RSS and its Sikh wing indulged in anti-Panth activities for long. This message issued to Sikh community by Akal Takht is still applicable and it has not been revoked. In that case, a large section of Sikh community does not deem it fit to participate with RSS.Baba Gurwinder Singh is a prominent Sikh preacher in the region, who has a big following. He preaches Gurbani of Guru Granth Sahib and motivates the community members to follow the teachings of Sikh Gurus. He follows the line of the Udasi sect that started with Baba Sri Chand, one of two sons of Guru Nanak Dev, the first Sikh Guru.","Baba Gurwinder Singh is head of Gurdwara Udasin Braham Akhara Sahib, Mandi in Pehowa area of Kurukshetra district.

Amid clamors for replacing Joe Biden as the Democrat's presidential candidate, he said it could cost the Democrat the 2024 election. He said it will be a huge mistake as those who are asking Biden to bow out of the contest are not doctors and they do not know whether Biden is capable of continuing another term or not.""This is foolhardy nonsense,"" the American University historian said on CNN.Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half century, except for the race in 2000, using a series of 13 historical factors or “keys.” The system includes four factors based on politics, seven on performance, and two on candidate personality. Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or “keys,” to lose the White House, USA Today reported.Lichtman did not undermine the performance of the debate but said in 1984 former president Ronald Regan could swing the election despite performing poorly in the debate. “At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness,"" he said.""The media has vastly overstated this debate. 14 people are hardly a scientific sample. There have been now two or three polls taken since the debate and they have shown not a bit of movement. Certainly, Joe Biden looked lost, a step or two. Trump was forceful and disciplined but his entire approach was a torrent of lies. More than 30 lies that is one lie for every minute and 20 seconds of speaking time,"" the historian said to Channel 4.""A lost of critics are saying Democrats should replace Biden with a younger or capable nominee. What all these critics have in common is no track record of predicting election results and yet here they are, giving advice.

Biden could hold an hour-long press conference at the White House and continue holding them every week until election; he could do an interview with 60 Minutes this week, to be aired next Sunday; he could meet the editorial board of the New York Times so that they can see that they were wrong to call for his resignation; and do another appearance on a late-night show -- were the suggestions.As the two versions of Biden gained ground, White House aides said the President functions smoothly between 10-4 daylight window and becomes prone to gaffes after 4 pm.New York Times which also called Biden to opt out of the contest noted the stark differences between the two Bidens.

Singh, a prime accused in the murder of coal mafia Raju Jha, has been implicated in multiple crimes in Bengal including kidnapping and robbery.In 2022, he was accused of kidnapping and attempting to rob Raniganj businessman Sundar Bhallutia in which case he has been brought on transit remand .Additionally, he was also accused of threatening to kill several businessmen, including Ajay Mandal at Belghoria, last month.He was produced before an Asansol court on Sunday and the judge ordered one day of judicial custody. He will be presented in court again on Monday. However as he was leaving the court premises, the gangster claimed he was framed. “I've been in jail for six years. They are framing me for no reason. The police have no work; they are incompetent and unable to control crime in Bengal. So, they are blaming me for their own ineptitude,” Singh said while climbing into the prison van.According to cops, Singh, a class eight dropout, operates through 70 of his handpicked men – and coordinates with local criminals. Subodh’s name has cropped up again and again since last year in the spate of robberies from Barrackpore to Ranaghat and recent ones at Raniganj and Domjur.However, his alleged role in the recent attack on a businessman at Belghoria after he refused to pay his gang extortion money (Rangdari tax) remains till date his most brazen move. “He is known to pay each member a salary of Rs 20-22,000 besides huge incentives after each successful operation. “He keeps 15 percent of crime money with him, another 15 percent goes as incentives. The rest, if gold, gets smuggled for huge profits,” claimed a source.","Gangster Subodh Singh was brought from Beur Jail in Bihar to Asansol in West Bengal on transit on Sunday by CID.

He no longer has the mental acuity to make important judgments about himself,"" Ackman wrote.Instead, Ackman placed the responsibility on the First Lady, suggesting that her attachment to the perks of her position is influencing her decisions. ""It is becoming increasingly clear however that the fault lies with @FLOTUS Jill Biden. FL Jill Biden becomes irrelevant the moment her husband is no longer president. No more Air Force One. No more glamorous life. No more White House dinners for dignitaries. No more being treated like a queen when traveling the world,"" he continued in the post.Ackman accused First Lady Jill Biden of valuing her lifestyle over the president's health and the country's safety. ""I am sorry to be harsh, but what has become entirely clear is that the First Lady values what is best for herself over her husband's health and the safety and security of the country at large. Stress is a contributor to neurological deterioration and the doctors must have told her so.

""Her power has clearly grown as he gets weaker. And she likes the feeling of power. She speaks for the president when he can't or when he is napping.

Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has maintained a high profile since his own 2020 presidential bid. His articulate communication style and experience as a cabinet member make him a strong contender. California governor Gavin Newsom: Newsom has been a vocal and high-profile governor, particularly noted for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in California. His progressive policies and strong state leadership position him as a potential candidate should Biden withdraw. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer: Whitmer has gained national attention for her leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and her strong stance on various social issues. Her popularity in a key swing state adds to her potential candidacy. Senator Elizabeth Warren: Warren, known for her progressive stance on economic issues and her strong advocacy for consumer protection, remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party.

North Korea executes man for listening to 70 K-pop songs: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-executes-man-for-listening-to-70-k-pop-songs-report/articleshow/111331129.cms,"A recent report by South Korea's unification ministry has revealed the extreme measures taken by North Korean authorities to control the influx of foreign culture and information, particularly from South Korea. The 2024 Report on North Korean Human Rights, which compiles testimonies from 649 North Korean defectors , highlights a disturbing case of a 22-year-old man from South Hwanghae province who was publicly executed in 2022 for ""listening to 70 South Korean songs , watching three films, and distributing them,"" violating a 2020 North Korean law that prohibits ""reactionary ideology and culture"".The Guardian said that the report also details other instances of crackdowns on practices deemed ""reactionary,"" such as brides wearing white dresses, grooms carrying the bride, wearing sunglasses, or drinking alcohol from wine glasses, all of which are perceived as South Korean customs.Additionally, mobile phones are frequently inspected for contact name spellings, expressions, and slang terms that are considered to be influenced by South Korea, despite the fact that both Koreas share the same language with subtle differences that have emerged since the division after the Korean War of 1950-1953.The ban on K-pop is part of a larger campaign initiated by former leader Kim Jong-il and intensified under his son Kim Jong-un to protect North Koreans from the perceived negative influence of Western culture .In 2022, the US government-funded Radio Free Asia reported that the regime was cracking down on ""capitalist"" fashion and hairstyles, targeting skinny jeans, T-shirts with foreign words, and dyed or long hair. Experts believe that allowing South Korean popular culture to infiltrate North Korean society could threaten the ideology that demands absolute loyalty to the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.Despite the harsh measures implemented by the North Korean government, the influence of South Korean culture appears to be unstoppable, according to a recent North Korean defector.The woman in her early 20s, who defected from North Korea, said, ""The speed of South Korean culture influencing North Korea is seriously fast. Young people follow and copy South Korean culture, and they really love anything South Korean.""Information continues to seep through and be distributed via informal networks, even with the border to China largely sealed off due to the Covid-19 outbreak.In recent weeks, North Korea has retaliated against the launch of balloons from the South containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, dollar bills, and USB sticks loaded with K-pop and K-dramas by sending thousands of balloons over the border containing waste.The defector also shed light on the hidden resentment against the regime, saying, ""Of course we cannot say anything bad against Kim Jong-un publicly, but among close friends, lovers or family members, we do say those words.""She added, ""After watching Korean dramas, many young people wonder, 'Why do we have to live like this?' ...

Panicked Democrats call for Joe Biden to stand down after debate debacle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panicked-democrats-call-for-joe-biden-to-stand-down-after-debate-debacle/articleshow/111347303.cms,"WASHINGTON: US Democrats are in panic mode after a disastrous Presidential debate on Thursday night in which their presumptive nominee Joe Biden had what can charitably described as several senior moments, including a brain freeze that became a gif (repeat gif) that will keep on giving.The sitting President's performance was so sketchy and shaky that some Democrats are suggesting he should step down and allow the party convention to nominate a new younger candidate to take on Donald Trump , 78, whose performance at the debate was shallow and superficial, but who at least projected confidence along with his familiar bluster.In contrast, Biden, 81, came across as frail and feeble. Speaking in a thin, raspy voice -- ostensibly because he is recovering from a cold -- he was often incomprehensible and disjointed, his voice trailing off into mumbles. He failed to corner a rival who is a recently convicted felon, and who was winging it with vague generalities and dissembling when asked specific policy questions.Despite calls from some quarters to quit the race, Biden associates said he will be preparing to participate in the second presidential debate on September 10. He will have nearly ten weeks to shape up if he is not shipped out by them.Even Biden partisans were shocked by the evening's debacle.“I love Joe Biden. I know he’s a good man. I know his heart is good. I know he’s dedicated to our country and is surrounded by good people.Tonight was heartbreaking in many ways. This is a big political moment. There’s panic in the Democratic party . It’s going to be a long night,"" Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and a member of the Kennedy family wrote on the social media platform X.Former Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill offered a more blunt take, saying while the debate showcased that Trump is “a liar, a flawed character, mean, a jerk, very unlikable,” Biden ""had one thing he had to accomplish and that was reassure America that he was up to the job at his age, and he failed at that tonight,”“I’m not the only one whose heart is breaking right now. There’s a lot of people who watched this tonight and felt terribly for Joe Biden,” she added.Party veterans tried to stem the panic, suggesting that voters should look at the larger picture. ""It's a choice between someone who cares about you -- your rights, your prospects, your future -- versus someone who's only in it for himself,"" former First Lady, Senator, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said.But with polls showing Biden's age is going against him, there is pressure in the Democratic establishment from activists and donors to act quickly. “Joe had a horrible night, cementing concerns about his age, his greatest electoral weakness. Our odds of Trumpocalypse II just materially increased. It’s tragic, since we could have chosen to let Trump and the nation marinate over him being a convicted felon,” Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a Democratic donor was quoted as saying in an email to party insiders.","Biden, 81, came across as frail and feeble.

He was unwell,"" said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. ""What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.""The debate strategy, approved by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and backed by Dunn, involved a rigorous preparation schedule at Camp David.Prior to the debate, Biden's poll numbers had begun to improve following Trump's conviction for falsifying documents and the president's successful visits to Europe. However, critics argue that the preparation should have focused more on the broader vision Biden needs to convey to the nation, and that he lacked sufficient rest before the event.The decision to participate in the debate came as a surprise to some advisers, with Biden's team opting to reject the traditional debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates in favor of a more controlled setting on CNN. Despite this, Biden's performance was widely criticized, with his appearance and demeanor described as wan, straggly, and frequently incoherent.In the aftermath of the debate, Biden delivered a strong speech in North Carolina and pledged to continue his campaign, with many donors and Democrats rallying around him.

The opposition in the Pakistan 's Punjab assembly held a session on Saturday amidst the rising tensions with the treasury, vowing to reject Maryam Nawaz as the chief minister and referring to her as ""fake Form-47,"" while the speaker took action and suspended all opposition leaders.According to the Pakistan-based Dawn the conflict between opposition lawmakers from the PTI (Sunni Ittehad Council) and ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) lawmakers intensified after 11 opposition members were suspended for 15 sittings due to ""rowdyism"" during Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz's address on Friday.The situation further intensified when the government revoked the perks and privileges of opposition leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar and sealed his chamber in the assembly.As the session began on Saturday, a large contingent of police and a prisoner van were stationed outside the Punjab Assembly, with instructions to prevent the 11 suspended lawmakers from entering the premises. In a show of solidarity with the suspended lawmakers, the opposition legislators conducted their own session outside the assembly gate, making statements against Maryam Nawaz and the PML-N leadership.Ahmad Khan Bhachar said, ""The government wants to silence us through civil dictatorship, but we will never accept fake Form-47 CM Maryam Nawaz,"" while addressing the charged Members of the Provincial Assembly.At his speech, the PTI lawmakers shouted slogans like ""mandate thieves"" and accused Maryam Nawaz's father and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif , of corruption.In addition, the PTI lawmakers initiated a privilege motion against Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan, alleging that he had succumbed to ""submitting to CM Maryam's pressure"" to suspend opposition members.

Kabul harbouring TTP leaders, claims Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had requested a decision on her plea filed in the sessions court seeking suspension of her sentence.The court will announce the reserved verdict on June 27 at 3 pm (local time) while the hearing on the couple's plea seeking annulment of their conviction in the said case will be resumed on July 2, Geo News reported.PTI has been awaiting a favorable decision as a major relief for Imran Khan, who has been acquitted in some cases or has been granted bail in others. However, it is also likely that the government will try to block his release as Pakistan prime minister's Adviser on political and public affairs Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday gave credence to the reports that the federal government was planning to register new cases against the incarcerated PTI founder.Speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath', Sanaullah said, ""Imran Khan's main agenda is to destabilise the country and spread chaos and anarchy in the country that's why the government will certainly try to keep him behind bars as long as possible.""Rana Sanaullah made these remarks while responding to a question on reports that the government was planning to delay the release of former Pakistan PM Imran Khan as the courts granted him relief in several cases, according to Geo News report.Sanaullah said Imran Khan ""boycotted"" parliament and launched the agitation movement against the government after the PTI government was ousted through a no-confidence motion in 2022.Pakistan PM's adviser said, ""Persistently he has only one agenda spread anarchy and mischief in the country, hence for the betterment of the country he [Imran Khan] should be kept behind bars."" He said that the federal government would use all legal means, including registration of new cases to delay the release of Imran Khan.","An Islamabad local court will announce the verdict on the pleas filed by former Pakistan PM Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi seeking suspension of their sentences in the iddat case. Imran Khan has been facing several charges, including corruption and terrorism since his removal as Pakistan's PM. The PTI founder has remained in prison after he was sentenced in the Toshakhana case and subsequently sentenced in other cases before the elections held on February 8.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111301866,imgsize-779917,width-400,resizemode-4/111301866.jpg"
Pak’s Balochistan home minister alleges India’s RAW backing ‘TTP-BLA nexus’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/paks-balochistan-home-minister-alleges-indias-raw-backing-ttp-bla-nexus/articleshow/111298922.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Following a backlash over Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent call for a military offensive, the home minister of the restive Balochistan province accused India on Wednesday of being the “single investor” of banned outfits Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) and Balochistan Liberation Army ( BLA ), responsible for carrying out terror attacks and abductions in the country.Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta, Balochistan’s capital. He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.
