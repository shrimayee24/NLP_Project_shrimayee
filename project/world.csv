DEHRADUN: An elderly woman is battling for her life after two Rottweilers owned by a neighbour leapt over a boundary wall and mauled her while she was walking to a local temple in Dehradun's Rajpur area, police said on Monday.Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones, and required nearly 200 stitches. The domestic help managed to bring the dogs back inside following the attack.Devi was initially treated at Shri Mahant Indresh Hospital before being referred to another facility for surgery on her hand and ear, which was almost ripped off in the attack, which occurred around 4am on Sunday.Nafees Ahmed, owner of the dogs, had left them at the house of his friend, Mohammed Zaid, from where the dogs had pounced at the woman. At the time of the incident, Zaid was not present at the house and only a domestic help was there.Ahmed has been detained by police for questioning while Zaid was charged under BNS section 291 (negligent conduct with respect to animals). A police probe is on. Sub-inspector Mukesh Negi, who is overseeing the investigation, said Devi's son, Umang Nirwal, filed a complaint at Rajpur police station.Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said Ahmed was detained and brought to the police station for questioning. ""We found that Ahmed didn't have the required license from the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) to keep the dogs as pets. We will record Devi's statement once her health permits, and more criminal sections could be added in the case, if needed.""He added that following incidents of attacks on people by pet dogs of dangerous breeds, the department of animal husbandry and dairy under the Central govt had earlier banned the import or breeding of dogs of certain breeds deemed dangerous, including Rottweiler, Cane Corso, Kangal, Pitbull, Pitbull Terrier, Dogo Argentino and Wolfdog.""If any resident in the city is experiencing problems due to dogs of these breeds kept as pet by people in his/her neighbourhood, then they can inform police by calling the emergency number of 112, nearby police station or the DMC office for necessary action,"" added Singh.The incident has created widespread outrage in the local community.Residents and corporator Sanjay Nautiyal met Singh and mayor Saurabh Thapliyal to demand strict legal action against Ahmed and Zaid, noting that the same dogs had allegedly attacked four other people previously.Nautiyal told TOI, ""In earlier instances, Ahmed either threatened the victims or arranged settlements to avoid police complaints. This time, too, he dismissed their concerns, daring them to take action.""","Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones.

KANPUR: An eight-year-old boy's courtroom testimony against his mother led to her conviction and death sentence for murdering his three younger brothers by drowning them in a river after sedating them with spiked food at the behest of her lover in Uttar Pradesh's Auraiya last year.""A woman who can kill her children does not have the right to live in society,"" additional district and sessions judge Saif Ahmed said Thursday. Judge Ahmed called it a ""rarest of rare"" crime and handed 30-year-old Priyanka death penalty and a Rs 2.5 lakh fine for killing her sons, aged six, four, and 18 months. Her partner Ashish - who is her dead husband's nephew - was sentenced to life in prison and fined Rs 1 lakh.Investigators said Ashish told Priyanka he would only be with her if she ""got rid of the children"". Priyanka took her four sons to Sengur riverbank in Devarpur after a quarrel with Ashish on June 27, 2024. She had drugged the children and threw them one by one into the water. Locals managed to rescue the eldest boy, who regained consciousness and later testified against his mother. The bodies of the younger boys were found soon after.Police arrested Priyanka and Ashish the next day. During trial, the son's eyewitness account and statements from six others, including Priyanka's brother-in-law, proved crucial for prosecution.""Court classified the crime 'rarest of rare' after it was established beyond doubt that the woman intentionally drowned her children. It's a horrifying act & demands strictest punishment,"" said govt counsel Abhishek Mishra.Priyanka had moved with her children to her parental home after her husband Avnish Kumar died of electrocution while she was pregnant with their fourth child. Facing financial hardship, she later entered into a relationship with Ashish.Since her arrest, Priyanka has been held at Etawah jail. She had expressed repeated desire to meet her firstborn, who now lives with his paternal aunt in Etawah, but the reunion never happened. Outside courtroom, Priyanka's family said they accept the verdict. ""Ashish should have been hanged too,"" Priyanka's aunt Geeta Devi said.Her father Pramod Kumar, a barber, said: ""We never had the money to hire a lawyer or seek bail. We'll approach the President for a pardon.""","Priyanka Kumar, 30, sentenced to death and a Rs 2.5 lakh fine for killing her sons. Her partner Ashish sentenced to life in prison and fined Rs 1 lakh.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah’s National Conference (NC) notified Srinagar district authorities Thursday that it will observe July 13 as Martyrs’ Day, reigniting political contention over the region’s historical memory and post-Article 370 identity.The date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside Srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against Maharaja Hari Singh, then Dogra monarch of J&K.NC also appealed to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha to reinstate July 13 and Dec 5 as public holidays. Both dates were struck off J&K’s official holiday calendar in Jan 2020, six months after the abrogation of Article 370. Until then, July 13 had been observed annually as Martyrs’ Day, while Dec 5 marked the birth anniversary of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.In a letter to the Srinagar DC, NC said party president Farooq Abdullah and senior functionaries will visit martyrs’ graveyard in the city’s old quarters Sunday morning to lay floral tributes. NC requested security arrangements for the 8am visit.Opposition PDP president Mehbooba Mufti criticised NC’s move, saying the initiative lacked credibility. “Omar Abdullah-led govt’s proposal to the LG would have carried weight had the Speaker supported PDP’s resolution on the matter in the assembly,” she said, referring to the Speaker’s rejection of PDP’s proposal in March.“By dropping PDP’s July 13 Martyrs’ Day resolution, J&K assembly has exposed NC’s double-speak on Kashmir’s history. Their silence proves complicity, not commitment,” Mehbooba said.Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari also weighed in, urging Union govt to officially declare July 13 as Martyrs’ Day. He said his party would visit the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib to pay respect and had already sought permission from authorities.Bukhari used the moment to press for a revision of domicile laws. Addressing CM Abdullah directly, he demanded that the eligibility for J&K domicile be raised from 15 to 50 years of residency.“This is entirely within your authority and discretion. I urge you with folded hands, please, at the very least, do this much for the people of J&K,” he said.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah’s National Conference will observe July 13 as Martyrs’ Day.

SRINAGAR: As political parties in Kashmir continue to raise concerns over “demographic change” and the opening of liquor shops in the Valley, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Thursday slammed such comments, asserting that these narratives echoed those of terrorist groups like The Resistance Front (TRF).“Some people are giving irresponsible statements that guests are spoiling the culture of J&K. They are stating there is a demographic invasion, and that alcoholism is spreading,” Sinha said.“This is a narrative similar to that of terror outfit TRF. I appeal to those making such statements to stop peddling such a narrative. We have already lost many innocent lives due to similar statements in the past,” Sinha said after inaugurating an exhibition and public outreach initiative in Srinagar.Sinha issued a warning to “divisive elements” to stop spreading what he termed “fake and dangerous narratives” that threaten peace and harmony.Valley-based parties, including NC and PDP, while rejecting the J&K Grant of Domicile Certificate (Procedure) Rules 2020, have alleged these were aimed at changing the demography of Kashmir.Earlier this year, Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of NC had called tourism in Kashmir a “cultural invasion”. PDP legislator Waheed Parra had also claimed that “fears of demographic change in Kashmir are real”.","Political parties in Kashmir continue to raise concerns over ‘demographic change’ and the opening of liquor shops in the Valley.

As the US government finally closed the Epstein case announcing that the convicted sex offender who died in 2019 by suicide did not have a client list, Prince Andrew who was linked to the case is now free to travel abroad. According to reports, there was no embargo on Prince Andrew but he imposed a travel ban on himself as he was stated that he could be arrested if he travels outside the UK.The 65-year-old Royal family member who lost all his titles after he was accused of sexually exploiting a minor at Epstein island left the UK once in the last six years. “He has been abroad once since the scandal erupted,” a source told the Sun.“He has always been very nervous about going abroad and felt he’d always be looking over his shoulder as he could be subject to civil action or at worst, being arrested.”“Hopefully with this out of the way it means he can at least leave the country,” the insider said. “What’s he supposed to do with the rest of his life? He hasn’t been convicted of any crime and can’t sit around doing nothing at Royal Lodge forever.”Before the lawsuit, he was known to be trotting the globe.Virginia Giuffre, the woman who mysteriously died by suicide earlier this year, sued Prince Andrew and claimed that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17, after she was trafficked by Epstein.In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew's attorneys reached an agreement to settle the case in exchange of a hefty amount of money but Prince Andrew denied any wrongdoing. He said he did not even remember meeting Giuffre, though his photo with Giuffre surfaced online.In 2020, the FBI had asked the UK Home Office to assist it in bringing Andrew in for questioning, but the investigation was put on hold in 2024 for reasons unknown. Andrew admitted that he had associations with Epstein but he cut those in 2010.

Khalil was also denied a temporary release when his wife gave birth to their first child. Last month, Khalil was released from federal immigration detention after being held for more than 100 days without being charged with a crime.Khalil's attorneys accused the government of subjecting him to false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the claim filed Thursday.""These harms are the result of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's ad hoc and conclusory determination"" that Khalil's presence in the US poses a foreign policy threat, the attorneys said, adding that if Khalil wins the case and the administration pays him, then he would share the money to help others who are similarly being targeted by the Trump administration.""He would accept, in lieu of payment, an official apology and abandonment of the administration's unconstitutional policy,"" the attorneys said.Khalil could still be deported as the case is going on.“They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,” Khalil said. “Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”Khalil also accused the government of terrorizing him to which the administration reacted and said it was Khalil who terrorized Jewish students.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced sweeping new measures aimed at restricting undocumented immigrants from accessing taxpayer-funded education and health care programs, according to The New York Post. The move, officials claim, could save approximately $40 billion.Multiple federal departments, including Education, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, and Health and Human Services (HHS)- issued separate statements underscoring the policy shift. The Department of Health and Human Services described the change as a “significant policy shift” designed to ensure that public benefit programs are reserved for US citizens and legal residents.“Taxpayer-funded program benefits intended for the American people should not be diverted to subsidize illegal aliens,” the HHS statement noted.White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said President Donald Trump is preparing to launch the largest-ever “mass deportation operation,” fulfilling a key campaign promise.“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history.There will be no amnesty, only deportations of violent, criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden welcomed into the country,” said Jackson as quoted by Axios.Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the administration would block undocumented immigrants from accessing federally supported education programs.“Hardworking American taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for illegal aliens participating in our career, technical, or adult education programs,” she said. “These funds will be reserved for citizens and those who have entered legally and meet federal eligibility criteria.”Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that states would also be expected to prevent undocumented migrants from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.“For too long, the generosity of the American taxpayer has been abused by faulty interpretations of the 1996 welfare reform law,” Rollins said, referencing the Clinton-era Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).The administration has moved to reinterpret PRWORA, tightening the definition of “federal public benefits.” Under the new interpretation, several HHS programs—including Head Start, the early childhood education initiative—now fall under the restricted category.Andrew Gradison, acting assistant secretary at HHS, said the change “puts American families first by ensuring taxpayer-funded benefits are reserved for eligible individuals.”In a cabinet meeting earlier this week, Trump reiterated his hardline stance: “There will be no amnesty. What we’re doing is getting rid of criminals. But we are doing a work program,” he said, suggesting some undocumented workers could remain if their employers assume responsibility for them.In line with the broader crackdown, the administration has also opened a new migrant detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” located in the swamps of Florida.","The Trump administration announced sweeping new measures aimed at restricting undocumented immigrants from accessing taxpayer-funded education and health care programs.

Federal agents and protesters engaged in a violent clash during an official raid on a Southern California farm on Thursday (local time). Authorities used smoke canisters to disperse protesters as border patrol and CBP vehicles blocked roads in Camarillo’s farm belt, with military-style vehicles and a helicopter overhead.The raid was carried out by federal agents executing a warrant at a marijuana facility. According to the department of homeland security, the operation involved Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). While cannabis cultivation is legal in California with proper licensing, and the company, Glass House Farms, does hold valid permits, officials have not disclosed the specific reason for the warrant.Moreover, a protester was seen allegedly firing a gun at federal agents, moments after agents used smoke canisters to disperse the crowd, according to ABC7.Judith Ramos, a 22-year-old nurse assistant, said her father, who works in the tomato fields, called her Thursday morning warning that immigration agents were at his job. She rushed to the farm, saw people being taken away on a bus, and joined protesters before agents deployed a deterrent that affected her eyes. She hasn’t heard from her father since and said his truck remains at the site.“They didn't want us to get any closer, and they started firing,” AP quoted Ramos saying.“I got some in my eyes. I had to put milk on my face.”The raid comes amid a broader crackdown by federal immigration agents in Southern California, targeting places like farms and parking lots and heightening fear in immigrant communities.Backed by National Guard units, recent operations have included heavily armed caravans. During Thursday’s raid, emergency crews responded and took three people to the hospital, though details on their injuries remain unclear.","Authorities used smoke canisters to disperse protesters as border patrol and CBP vehicles blocked roads in Camarillo’s farm belt.

""It was written by students, not by teachers or staff. After it came to our notice, the matter was raised in finance committee and consultations were held with the purchase committee to remove it. But the incident took place before it could be removed. The graffiti bearing Mishra's name will be erased soon,"" she said.According to Chatterji, she had noticed the graffiti during Saraswati Puja on Feb 2. Students said the incident had happened only in June-end. ""Why was the graffiti allowed to remain for nearly five months? How does an approval for one litre of paint required to wipe off the graffiti take so long?"" some wondered.Chatterji said the college administration had to follow a process and obey the decisions of governing body. Sources said it was on the governing body's recommendation that Mishra had been given a temporary appointment despite him being rusticated from the college when he was a student and had multiple criminal cases against him.TOI tried to get a reaction from governing body president Ashok Deb but he did not take the call. Sibranjan Chatterjee, a member, said, ""Matters referred to general body were discussed in the meeting. But I cannot recall anything related to a graffiti being raised in any recent meeting that I attended. GB members went to college only for attending meetings; other than that, we cannot keep track of regular activities on campus unless the authorities inform us. ""Chatterji reiterated on Thursday that those accused of rape should get the highest possible punishment.","'Monojit Dada is in our hearts — team MM', reads a wall graffiti in a prominent spot at the law college where a first-year student was raped.

What sparked the illegal work claims on Elon Musk



“I was in fact allowed to work in the US.”

Poll Do you think visa and work authorization rules for foreign entrepreneurs should be stricter? No, flexibility helps innovation and growth Yes, stricter rules ensure fairness and security

Musk laughed off the allegations during campaign stops



Visa history: From J-1 to H-1B, according to Musk



The story whipped around social media in late October, after The Washington Post reported that a young Elon Musk stayed in the United States and built his first start-up without the papers he needed. President Joe Biden seized on it at a campaign stop, calling Musk “an illegal worker.” Within hours, Musk fired back on X (the platform he owns), writing that he was permitted to work and accusing “the Biden puppet” of lying.Reporters dug up 1990s emails, venture-capital term sheets, and board-room recollections that showed Zip2’s investors once feared their founder could be deported if the visa issue surfaced during an IPO filing. Immigration lawyers told the Post that a foreign student who drops out of school to run a company is, plain and simple, out of status.On 27 October 2024, Musk posted:A follow-up message claimed he held “a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H-1B.” He offered no documents, but the tweets set the tone: outright denial, laced with a jab at Biden.Hours later, while stumping for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Musk brushed away a question about the report with two laughing-crying emojis and a line: “So now he cares about illegals.” The moment drew cheers from the crowd and rolled straight into a riff about how, in Musk’s words, “it’s easier for a murderer to get into America than a Nobel laureate.”Public records confirm Musk entered the US on a student visa for a Stanford PhD he never started. He has said in podcasts that the period was a “grey area,” yet insists he obtained proper work authorisation by 1997. Former Zip2 board members recall scrambling to hire immigration counsel and giving the Musks 45 days to “get legal or lose funding.”","The Washington Post reported that a young Elon Musk stayed in the United States and built his first start-up without the papers he needed.

50% tariff & 'witch hunt' cry: Why Trump is going all-out against Brazil; is it beyond economics?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/50-tariff-witch-hunt-cry-why-trump-is-going-all-out-against-brazil-is-it-beyond-economics/articleshow/122377745.cms,"Why is Trump lashing out at Brazil?



Trump targets Lula for backing what he calls a ‘witch hunt’ trial against Bolsonaro





US tariff move defies economic logic



Brazilian businesses urge calm



Copper and national security



Brics tensions escalate



Free speech concerns deepen the rift



Bolsonaro remains central to Trump’s stance







NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has imposed a steep 50 percent tariff on all Brazilian imports, triggering a diplomatic row with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who vowed to retaliate and warned against “tutelage. ”The move marks a sharp escalation in tensions, with analysts pointing to ideological motives behind Trump’s decision to target Brazil, one of America’s key trading partners.The timing of the announcement, which comes as former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro faces trial for allegedly plotting a coup, has intensified speculation that Trump is defending a political ally rather than responding to economic factors. Lula responded with strong words on X: “Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage.”Trump's decision is being seen in the context of Bolsonaro’s ongoing legal troubles. In a letter to Lula, Trump called the trial of Bolsonaro “an international disgrace” and claimed it “should not be taking place.” The US president went further, warning of additional trade actions if Brazil retaliated.Eduardo Bolsonaro, the former president’s son, has moved to the United States and is lobbying against Brazil’s judiciary. Lula has accused him of disturbing bilateral relations, while Brazil’s Supreme Court has ordered an investigation into whether these efforts constitute obstruction of justice. The trial has become a flashpoint, with Bolsonaro calling Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes a “dictator,” and Trump declaring on Truth Social: “LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE. They have done nothing but come after him, day after day, night after night.”President Trump has escalated the diplomatic spat by linking the 50 percent tariffs directly to the legal proceedings against Jair Bolsonaro, accusing President Lula’s government of orchestrating a political “witch hunt.” In a letter to President Lula, Trump wrote: “This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”Trump has consistently framed Bolsonaro’s prosecution—on charges of plotting a coup following his defeat in 2022—as politically motivated persecution. He called on Brazilian authorities to “Leave Bolsonaro alone,” drawing parallels to his own legal battles: “This happened to me, times 10,” he said, promising to “be closely monitoring” the trial.Brazil’s Supreme Court trial, overseen by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, is examining allegations of a coup attempt by Bolsonaro and his allies. While Bolsonaro maintains his innocence and claims political targeting, Lula has responded firmly. He defended the judiciary’s role and asserted: “No one is above the law,” emphasizing Brazil’s sovereign judicial processes.Analysts suggest Trump’s linkage of economic measures to Bolsonaro’s trial reflects ideological solidarity rather than economic rationale. Brazil runs a trade surplus with the US, yet Trump’s administration is wielding tariffs as a means to pressure Lula’s government over internal justice matters.This overt intervention in Brazil’s judicial affairs has deepened tensions. Lula has vowed to respond under Brazil’s Economic Reciprocity Law, framing Trump’s move as an aggressive overstep that infringes on national sovereignty and judicial independence.Unlike Trump’s past trade actions, which usually targeted countries with which the US has a trade deficit, Brazil runs a consistent trade surplus in America’s favour. Official Brazilian data shows the US recorded a surplus of nearly $284 million last year. “Brazil came up on Trump's radar now because Bolsonaro's trial is advancing and there are Republican lawmakers who brought the issue to the White House,” said Leonardo Paz of Brazil’s Getulio Vargas Foundation.In his letter, Trump alleged “a very unfair trade relationship,” but Lula dismissed this as factually incorrect. “The claim regarding a US trade deficit... is inaccurate. Statistics from the US government itself show a surplus of $410 billion... over the past 15 years,” Lula posted on X.The São Paulo Federation of Industries urged a measured response, calling the tariff hike driven by “non-economic reasons.” Still, Lula signalled readiness to act under Brazil’s Economic Reciprocity Law. “Any unilateral tariff increases will be addressed,” he said.Trade data shows the US primarily imports crude oil and steel products from Brazil, while Brazil imports engines, machinery, and fuel from the US. The United States is Brazil’s third-largest trade partner, after China and the EU.Trump linked the tariff decision to national security, singling out copper as vital to defence infrastructure. “Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition... Missile Defense Systems, and even Hypersonic Weapons,” he said. The tariff on copper imports from Brazil takes effect on August 1.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that tariffs have already raised $100 billion and projected collections would reach $300 billion by December. Trump has imposed new duties on over 20 countries, with rates ranging from 20 to 50 percent, including nations like Japan, South Korea, and South Africa.Brazil’s hosting of the recent Brics summit added fuel to the fire. Member nations criticised Trump’s tariff hikes and US actions in Iran, prompting Trump to threaten a further 10 percent tariff on all Brics-aligned nations. “We don't want an emperor,” Lula responded at the summit, defending Brics’ sovereign stance.A Brazilian official told AFP that Trump’s attack was partly driven by “discomfort caused by the strength of the BRICS,” whose members represent nearly half the world’s population and a large share of global economic output.Donald Trump also accused Brazil’s Supreme Court of issuing “hundreds of SECRET and UNLAWFUL censorship orders to US media platforms.” Last month, the court toughened social media rules, holding platforms accountable for user content. Justice Moraes earlier blocked Musk’s X platform and suspended conservative-friendly Rumble for failing to comply with misinformation rulings.Critics say the court is overstepping and stifling free speech, while Lula defended judicial independence: “Freedom of expression must not be confused with aggression or violent practices.”Bolsonaro, despite being disqualified from future elections, thanked Trump for defending him. Trump, in turn, claimed Bolsonaro remains the frontrunner for Brazil’s next election. The US embassy in Brasília also weighed in, saying: “Jair Bolsonaro and his family have been strong partners of the United States. The political persecution... is shameful.”","US President Donald Trump has imposed a steep 50 percent tariff on all Brazilian imports.

What is Brazil’s Economic Reciprocity Law?





Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has responded to US President Donald Trump’s Wednesday announcement on his plans to implement a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports.Trump's letter addressed to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated the tariffs would commence on August 1, in a bid to provide ""Level Playing Field” while lashing out at the current Brazilian government for unjust criminal trial against their former President Jair Bolsonaro.Lula said he will be forced to trigger Brazil's economic reciprocity law, approved by Congress, if the US fails to negotiate.He said, “If there’s no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,” reported AP, citing Brazilian media outlets.Signed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on April 14 this year, Brazil’s “Economic Reciprocity Law,” allows Brazil to suspend trade, investment, and intellectual property concessions in response to unilateral measures by other countries or blocs that harm its competitiveness. The law is a strategic response by Brazil to address tariffs introduced by the Trump administration against multiple countries.Lula posted in a tweet on X, “The Brazilian people must be respected. Brazilian justice must be respected. We are a great, sovereign country with a historic tradition of diplomacy with all nations. Brazil will adopt the necessary measures to protect its people and its companies.”Trump publicly opposed the criminal proceedings against Bolsonaro on Monday as well, concerning the former president's attempts to retain power following his defeat in Brazil's 2022 election. Lula responded decisively, telling reporters on Monday, ""I think it's very wrong and very irresponsible for a president to be threatening others on social media. People have to learn that respect is a good thing."" He further remarked about Trump, ""He needs to know that the world has changed. We don't want an emperor.""Lula's remarks heighten the risk of a potential tariff war between the two nations, with Trump pledging a strong retaliatory response to any punitive tariffs imposed on the US.","Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has responded to US President Donald Trump’s announcement on his plans to implement a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports.

A dramatic standoff unfolded inside a Southern California surgical center when ICE agents chased a Honduran landscaper into the facility, allegedly without a warrant, triggering a confrontation with stunned clinic staff.In a viral video from Tuesday’s incident, medical workers in scrubs can be seen physically shielding the man, who was crying and gasping for breath, while demanding agents show identification and legal grounds for detention.“Get your hands off of him. You don't even have a warrant. Let him go. You need to get out,” AP reported quoting a staff member.Immigration advocate Javier Hernandez confirmed that ICE agents ultimately arrested the Honduran man, whose whereabouts remain unknown. The man had been supporting his mother’s dialysis treatments back home.Hernandez cast doubt on ICE’s claim that the operation was targeted, noting that two of the man’s co-workers were also questioned until their legal status was verified. “There’s so many videos now that are out there. It's getting harder ... because the tactics are getting more violent,” AP quoted him saying.ICE has become more visible in migrant detentions, even arresting people at courts and workplaces. After two such incidents at parish properties, the San Bernardino bishop excused parishioners from Mass. DHS claimed agents were targeting two undocumented men in Ontario when one, a 30-year-old Honduran, fled into a surgery center. Officials accused staff of assaulting agents and obstructing the arrest.","Honduran landscaper chased into surgical center without a warrant.

AURAIYA: An eight-year-old boy’s courtroom testimony against his mother led to her conviction and death sentence for murdering his three younger brothers by drowning them in a river at the behest of her lover in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya last year.“A woman who can kill her children does not have the right to live in society,” additional district and sessions judge Saif Ahmed said Thursday. Judge Ahmed called it a “rarest of rare” crime and handed Priyanka (30) the death penalty and a Rs 2.5 lakh fine for killing her sons aged six, four, and 18 months.Her partner Ashish — who’s her dead husband’s nephew —was sentenced to life in prison and fined Rs 1 lakh.Investigators said Ashish told Priyanka he would only be with her if she “got rid of the children”. Priyanka took her four sons to Sengur riverbank in Devarpur after a quarrel with Ashish on June 27, 2024. She had drugged them and threw them one by one into the water. Locals managed to rescue the eldest boy, who regained consciousness and later testified against his mother. The bodies of the younger boys were found soon after.Police arrested Priyanka and Ashish the next day. During trial, the son’s eyewitness account and statements from six others, including Priyanka’s brother-in-law, proved crucial for the prosecution.“The court classified the crime as ‘rarest of rare’ after it was established beyond doubt that the woman intentionally drowned her children. It’s a horrifying act that demands the strictest punishment,” said govt counsel Abhishek Mishra.Priyanka had moved with her children to her parental home after her husband Avnish Kumar died of electrocution while she was pregnant with their fourth child. Facing financial hardship, she formed a relationship with Ashish.Priyanka’s family said they accepted the verdict. “She has been condemned for what she did. Ashish should have been hanged too,” her aunt said.","Eight-year-old boy's courtroom testimony against his mother led to her conviction and death sentence.

VADODARA: The death toll in the Gambhira bridge collapse near Vadodara rose to 18 on Thursday, with rescuers retrieving five more bodies from the Mahi river in Padra taluka. Two people are still missing, and 10 teams from the Vadodara fire brigade and NDRF are involved in the search operation, which was expected to continue until late at night.Four victims were found stuck in the riverbed under the truck that fell off the bridge, while the body of another was found around five kilometres away in the river near Dabka village. The deceased were identified as Yogesh Chauhan, a native of Bharuch, and Atul Rathod, Bhupendra Parmar, Dilip Padhiyar and Yogesh Patel, all from Anand district.District collector Anil Dhameliya said they are trying to trace a car and a truck that are missing and may possibly be stuck in the mud on the riverbed. ""The vehicles that fell off the bridge are stuck in the muck, and our teams are trying to remove them.""One day after the collapse of the Gambhira Bridge over the Mahi in Padra taluka, rescue teams were struggling to remove vehicles that fell into the river. District collector Anil Dhameliya said recovery operations were hindered by the thick mud in the riverbed.""The mud is about 10 feet deep at the spot where the vehicles fell into the river.We are trying to reach the vehicles and get them out. An improvised bridge has been made in the river for recovery operations,"" Dhameliya said. On Thursday evening, two Army trucks were brought to the spot to pull out a truck that fell into the river.The authorities say two vehicles, including a truck, are stuck in the mud under one large truck. Cranes are unable to reach the spot due to the mud, and trying to pull the truck from the damaged bridge would be too risky. Dhameliya said on Thursday afternoon that the recovery operation would continue for some hours. ""It is likely a few more bodies are in the vehicles that are stuck in the mud,"" an official said.Another danger is the empty tanker dangling on the collapsed end of the bridge. Even a slight disturbance could cause the tanker to fall 50 feet into the river below and further delay recovery operations.

4.5 magnitude earthquake hits Myanmar; no damage reported- third in one month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/4-5-magnitude-earthquake-hits-myanmar-no-damage-reported-third-in-one-month/articleshow/122378219.cms,"4.5 magnitude earthquake jolts Myanmar (Image credits: ANI)





A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.

'To focus on policy priorities': US State Department to send layoff notices to staffers soon; will undergo 'biggest reorganization',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-focus-on-policy-priorities-us-state-department-to-send-layoff-notices-to-staffers-soon-set-for-biggest-reorganization/articleshow/122377391.cms,"US Department of State

The 'reorganization' plan





The United States Department of State on Thursday formally informed its staffers that some of them would be receiving their layoff notices soon, as part of dramatic changes announced by the Donald Trump administration earlier this year.""The aim is to focus resources on policy priorities and eliminate redundant functions, empowering our people while increasing accountability,"" deputy secretary Michael Rigas said in a letter to the staffers, The Associated Press reported.“Soon, we will be communicating to individuals affected by the reduction in force. We want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States,” he added, and called it the ""biggest reorganization"" in decades.However, it wasn't immediately clear how many people would be dismissed.These workforce cuts and reorganization are part of a wider administration effort to reduce the size of the federal government. This work has been largely carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), formerly led by Elon Musk. recent ruling by the Supreme Court cleared the way for the layoffs to start, while lawsuits challenging the legality of the cuts continue to play out.In late May, the State Department notified the Congress of an updated reorganization plan, proposing cuts to programmes beyond what had been revealed earlier by secretary of state Marco Rubio, in addition to an 18% reduction of staff in the United States, even higher than the 15% initially floated in April.The Rubio-led department has proposed to eliminate some divisions tasked with oversight of America's two-decade involvement in Afghanistan, including an office focused on resettling Afghan nationals who worked alongside the US military. It also intends to eliminate policies related to refugees and immigration, as well as human rights and democracy promotion.Critics allege that the scale of cuts floated would ""lessen"" America's influence globally and make it hard for many departments to carry out their missions.The American Foreign Service Association, the union which represents diplomats, urged last month to hold off on job cuts.""Notices for a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate positions altogether, should be a last resort. Disrupting the Foreign Service puts national interests at risk — and Americans everywhere will bear the consequences,” association President Tom Yazdgerdi stated.","The US Department of State on Thursday formally informed its staffers that some of them would be receiving their layoff notices soon.

Trump seems to be warming to new sanctions on Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-seems-to-be-warming-to-new-sanctions-on-russia/articleshow/122377570.cms,"File photo





BERLIN: Since President Donald Trump retook the Oval Office, leaders across Europe have prodded him to forcefully back Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. In recent weeks, some of them tried a new approach in private conversations with a president who they know often responds well to flattery.In exchanges with Trump, those leaders, including Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, praised the president for sending US bombers to deliver a major blow to Iran's nuclear programme, according to two European officials familiar with the matter. They told Trump he could do something similar in Ukraine - not with bombs, but with a fresh batch of penalties aimed at crippling Russia's economy.The president finally appears to be warming to the idea.Merz and his counterparts in France, Britain and Italy have publicly told Trump that new US sanctions could force President Putin of Russia to enter serious negotiations about ending the war. Without them, Putin has been escalating and prolonging Russia's attacks in an attempt to break Ukraine's defences. Those escalations appear to have frayed Trump's patience with Putin.On Tuesday, fresh from what he portrayed as a frustrating phone conversation with Putin, Trump said he was ""very strongly"" considering supporting a bipartisan Senate bill that would impose severe sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.Those countries include China, India, Brazil and even some members of the EU.Oil production is a driver of Russia's economy and a crucial source of revenue for Putin's war machine. Western leaders have been trying to choke off those revenues since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, including with sanctions. They have not succeeded as well as they had hoped. A new effort to target the sector is included in the bill, which was offered by Senators Lindsey Graham (Republican) and Richard Blumenthal (Democrat). It has 83 supporters in the Senate.The top Senate Republican said Wednesday that a vote on the bill could come as soon as this month. Momentum has been building on Capitol Hill behind the measure. The majority leader, Senator John Thune (Republican), said Wednesday that ""substantial progress"" had been made on ""overwhelmingly bipartisan Russia sanctions legislation to enhance Trump's leverage at the negotiating table and help end the war in Ukraine. "" He said the measure could come to a Senate vote ""as early as this work period,"" referring to the period between now and Aug 1, when the chamber departs for a monthlong recess.Some analysts have suggested that the legislation, if approved, could pack a much larger punch than any previous sanctions imposed on Russia. But other analysts warn that it would take time for the bill's penalties to hit Russia hard enough to force Putin to negotiate, and that Trump might not follow through with many of them.Russian officials do not appear to be concerned about the prospect of Trump backing a new round of sanctions.","Leaders across Europe have prodded him to forcefully back Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.

The US State Department has launched a fresh initiative to alert Americans, with emphasis on Iranian Americans, claim grave dangers in visiting Iran. This announcement was made by State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who strongly advised against travel to Iran, particularly for those with Iranian heritage.During a press conference on Thursday (local time), Bruce said that Iran does not acknowledge dual citizenship and restricts consular access to US citizens in detention. She introduced a new website specifically designed to warn Americans about Iranian travel risks.Bruce said, ""The department is announcing a new awareness campaign warning Americans, especially Iranian Americans, about the continuing severe risks of travel to Iran. The Iranian regime does not recognize dual nationality and routinely denies consular services to detained US citizens. And while the bombing has stopped, that does not mean that it is safe to travel to Iran, it is not. We are also launching a new website dedicated to warning Americans against travel to Iran. And there you have it (Pointing to the website displayed on the screen). You can get that website starting at state.gov...Ithink if you go to state.gov, you do a search, you will find that quite easily.""She further added, ""The message is clear as you can tell in multiple languages. Our travel advisories are there as well. They remain in place and we cannot stress enough as we continue to do as I have multiple times from this podium. Do not travel to Iran especially those of you who are the dual citizens who have Iranian heritage. It is not safe for anyone to travel to Iran. And again, this supplements also the existing travel advisories. It does not supplant them at travel.state.gov. Our message is clear, I think so.""This advisory follows recent tensions involving conflicts between Israel and Iran, including US strikes on Iranian facilities.President Donald Trump recently expressed hope for avoiding further military engagement with Iran, indicating that Tehran seeks dialogue. He spoke at a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday (local time).Trump had said, ""I hope we're not going to have to do that. I can't imagine wanting to do that. I can't imagine them wanting to do that. They (Iran) want to meet ... They want to work something out. They are very different now than they were two weeks ago.""Regarding potential discussions with Iran, Trump confirmed scheduled talks, stating, ""We're going to have a meeting...We'll see what happens. We have scheduled Iran talks. They want to talk. They took a big drubbing, I think, when we hit the three sites.""Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed readiness for dialogue with the US whilst noting trust-building challenges due to previous US and Israeli actions, according to Al Jazeera.The situation escalated on June 13 when Israel initiated ""Operation Rising Lion"", conducting extensive strikes on Iranian facilities, including Natanz and Fordow nuclear sites, missile facilities, and IRGC bases.The operation resulted in casualties among IRGC leadership and nuclear scientists. The US followed with ""Operation Midnight Hammer"" on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear infrastructure.Iran responded with missile strikes against Israel and an attack on a US airbase in Qatar. Tehran condemned these operations as violations of international law and the UN Charter.","The US State Department has launched a fresh initiative to alert Americans, with emphasis on Iranian Americans, of grave dangers in visiting Iran.

Internet erupted in disbelief after 40-year-old MAGA commentator Nick Adams posted a video thanking President Donald Trump for the 'honor of a lifetime'. Social media users looked for official confirmation before dismissing it as a prank and found out that indeed Trump nominated the MAGA troll as the US ambassador to Malaysia. Adams has no prior experience in diplomacy though he has experience in politics but in Australia where he was born. In 2005, he became Australia's youngest ever deputy mayor when he was elected to help run suburban Ashfield.Out of his many peculiar policies, Adams wanted to ban pigeons and wanted to use DNA testing to track down dog owners who failed to clean up after their pets.“Mr. President, thank you for the honor of a lifetime. In your America, all dreams come true. It will be my honor to represent the United States of America in Malaysia,” Adams said in a clip posted to X on Thursday. “To the esteemed Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to a confirmation process that is at the heart of the Constitution that has given me the freedom to pursue the American Dream.”Adams is known for incendiary comments like he calls himself an ""alpha male"", called Taylor Swift ""woke Jezebel"" etc.“I go to Hooters. I eat rare steaks. I lift extremely heavy weights. I read the Bible every night. I am pursued by copious amounts of women. I am wildly successful. I have the physique of a Greek God. I have an IQ over 180. I am extremely charismatic. They hate this,"" Adams once said.""Imagine the Malaysian government finding out their ambassador from the US is Nick Adams,"" one user wrote while another commented that US was basically deporting him to Malaysia.Many people commented that they used to think that Nick Adams was not a real person and a parody account on X.South China Morning Post reported that Nick Adams could be a very wrong fit for Muslim-majority Malaysia which favors quiet diplomacy over headline-grabbing rhetoric. “It’s a surprising pick that favours political loyalists over those who actually fit the post,” the newspaper quotes an unnamed diplomat based in the Malaysian capital as saying.","Trump nominates Nick Adams as Malaysia ambassador.

‘Canary Mission’: Trump administration used shady website to get names of pro-Palestinian activists; could potentially lead to visa revocation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canary-mission-trump-administration-used-shady-website-to-get-names-of-pro-palestinian-activists-could-potentially-lead-to-visa-revocation/articleshow/122372090.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





Newly unsealed court documents and trial testimony have revealed that the Trump administration has heavily relied on an anonymously run pro-Israel website, accused of doxxing, to identify pro-Palestinian academics for potential deportation.The court records revealed that in order to support US President Donald Trump’s deportation drive, the Department of Homeland Security assembled a “tiger team” of intelligence who compiled data on roughly 100 foreign students and scholars involved in pro-Palestinian activism.The website, known as Canary Mission, flagged over 75 individuals.Canary Mission has stated that they did not have “contact with this administration or the previous administration,” as reported by Politico. They said that they have a mission to investigate hatred promoted against the US, Israel and Jews.“We document individuals and groups that promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews. We investigate hatred across the political spectrum, including the far-right, far-left and anti-Israel activists,” the group said.Previously, immigration lawyers as well as pro-Palestinian activists were skeptical that the Trump administration was utilizing the website to sort the names of the academics and potentially seeking to revoke their visas, with little to no independent research.But the depositions reveal how broadly the Trump administration relied on the website.Homeland security official Peter Hatch admitted that the site has been important to the Trump administration’s efforts but also stated the information taken from the website was independently verified.“Many of the names or even most of the names came from that website, but we were getting names and leads from many different websites,” Hatch said. “We received information on the same protesters from multiple sources, but Canary Mission was the most inclusive. The lists came in from all different directions.”“Canary Mission is not a part of the US government,” he said. “It is not information that we would take as an authoritative source. We don’t work with the individuals who create the website. I don’t know who creates the website,” said Hatch, as reported by Politico.Court records revealed that Trump aide Stephen Miller was heavily involved in efforts aiming to revoke the visas of pro-Palestinian academics who are studying and teaching at American colleges.","Newly unsealed court documents and trial testimony have revealed that the Trump administration has heavily relied on an anonymously run pro-Israel website.

"Setback for Trump: New Hampshire judge pauses birthright citizenship order; calls it 'lawless, cruel'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-for-trump-new-hampshire-judge-pauses-birthright-citizenship-order-calls-it-lawless-cruel/articleshow/122370461.cms,"Birthright Citizenship: Trump Elated As SC Decides To Hear His Case | 'Rooted In Slavery'





A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship in the United States, calling the move “lawless, unconstitutional and cruel. ”Judge Joseph LaPlante announced on Thursday that he would certify a class action lawsuit covering all children who would be affected by the order, and issue a preliminary injunction to halt its enforcement.The written ruling, he said, will follow shortly and include a seven-day stay to allow the federal government to appeal.The class certified by the court is slightly narrower than what the plaintiffs initially proposed, excluding parents from the group. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, represented a pregnant woman, two parents, and their newborns.The case is one of several challenging Trump’s January order, which denies automatic US citizenship to babies born to undocumented migrants or those in the country on temporary visas, AP reported.At the center of the legal fight is the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which grants citizenship to “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”The Trump administration argues that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” excludes children of people living in the US illegally, a position that, if upheld, would overturn over a century of settled legal interpretation.In court filings, government lawyers claimed that previous interpretations of the citizenship clause had created a “perverse incentive” for illegal immigration, harming the country’s sovereignty and security.Judge LaPlante, who previously issued a narrower injunction in a related case, said the government’s arguments were not frivolous but ultimately unconvincing. “This was not a close call,” he said, adding that stripping children of their citizenship posed “clear and irreparable harm.”Plaintiffs’ lawyer Cody Wofsy said the ruling would bring relief to countless families who had been left confused and frightened by the executive order. This “is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional and cruel executive order,” he said.Several federal judges had earlier issued nationwide injunctions to halt Trump’s order from taking effect. However, a US Supreme Court ruling on 27 June curtailed those injunctions, giving lower courts a 30-day window to respond. In light of that deadline, opponents swiftly returned to court in an effort to block the order once again.In Washington state, the 9th circuit court of appeals has asked both sides to explain how the Supreme Court’s decision affects ongoing challenges.CASA’s legal director Ama Frimpong urged everyone to remain calm and said that it is not time to panic.“No one has to move states right this instant,” she said, adding, “there's different avenues through which we are all fighting, again, to make sure that this executive order never actually sees the light of day.”The New Hampshire plaintiffs, who were anonymised in court documents, include a Honduran woman with a pending asylum claim, expecting her fourth child in October. She said she fled with her family to escape gangs targeting them.“I do not want my child to live in fear and hiding,” she wrote. “I fear our family could be at risk of separation.”Another plaintiff, a Brazilian man living in Florida, said his US-born baby deserved the right to citizenship. He and his wife are seeking permanent legal status through her father, a US citizen.“My baby has the right to citizenship and a future in the United States,” he said.","A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship in the United States.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt.

The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.

Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.

Pakistan protests: Baloch activist Gulzar Dost arrested; outrage over enforced disappearances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-protests-baloch-activist-gulzar-dost-arrested-outrage-over-enforced-disappearances/articleshow/122316947.cms,"Picture source: X





Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday in a wider effort by the Pakistani state to silence dissent in Balochistan.According to The Balochistan Post, Dost was taken from his home in Turbat during a raid by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and later charged with what The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) says were “false and politically motivated” allegations. It has demanded his immediate release.Dost was arrested early Monday morning during a CTD raid at his residence in Turbat. He was then brought before a court and charged, though the exact nature of the charges has not been publicly detailed.In a post on X, BYC described Dost as a peaceful citizen who has always spoken up for families of forcibly disappeared persons and victims of extrajudicial killings.“His only ‘crime’ is standing with the oppressed,” BYC said. “The state cannot tolerate that.”The committee also criticised the CTD, calling it a tool of state repression used to target grassroots activists. It accused authorities of carrying out unlawful raids, filing fake cases, and using forced disappearances to suppress political voices.BYC has demanded Dost’s unconditional release and warned that the continued targeting of activists will only increase resistance in the region.“If the state thinks it can create silence in Balochistan by targeting political activists, it is gravely mistaken,” the group said.The arrest is part of what rights groups say is an increasing pattern of intimidation against Baloch activists. Just two days ago, at least five men were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces during a series of raids in the Kech and Gwadar districts of Balochistan.A wave of anger has swept across Pakistan’s troubled Balochistan province after the reported abduction and killing of young Baloch activist Zeeshan Ahmed by military personnel. Zeeshan had been actively campaigning for the safe return of his father, Zaheer Ahmed, who was forcibly disappeared by the Frontier Corps back in 2015.","Gulzar Dost, a well-known social activist and convener of Kech Civil Society, was arrested on Monday.

Pakistan: Authorities seize 18 lions kept as pets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-authorities-seize-18-lions-kept-as-pets/articleshow/122313813.cms,"Keeping big pets considered a status symbol





Pakistani authorities confiscated eighteen lions kept illegally as pets in the densely populated Punjab region during a targeted operation, provincial officials said Monday.Authorities launched a crackdown after a lion escaped from a house in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, and attacked a woman and two children. The incident, which took place last week, was captured on video.None of the people suffered life-threatening injuries, according to provincial officials. The lion, which was kept without a license in a house in Lahore, was confiscated.The lion was sent to a local safari park, according to Mubeen Elahi, director general of the provincial Wildlife and Parks Department.Police said the owner was arrested.Keeping a lion at home without following the legal requirements for ownership of big cats is an offense punishable by up to seven years in jail, Elahi told the Reuters news agency.As well as confiscating the 18 animals, the department raided 38 lion and tiger breeding farms and arrested eight people for violating the rules, he said.There are more than 500 lions and tigers in homes and breeding farms in Punjab, Elahi said, adding they would be inspected by the end of the week.Keeping exotic animals is considered a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the high fees associated with ownership.","Authorities launched a crackdown after a lion escaped from a house in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children.

"Indus in turmoil: Swat Valley, Gilgit-Baltistan swamped by floods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/indus-in-turmoil-swat-valley-gilgit-baltistan-swamped-by-floods/articleshow/122305695.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.
