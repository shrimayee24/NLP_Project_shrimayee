"BJP rakes up Atishi link, AAP questions timing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-rakes-up-atishi-link-aap-questions-timing/articleshow/117247425.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday cited the support of CM Atishi 's parents for the campaign for clemency for Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru to allege that Aam Aadmi Party had links with NGOs who supported a terrorist whom Supreme Court sentenced to death for plotting the attack, which almost triggered a war with Pakistan.Talking to reporters after Delhi Police claimed that the hundreds of calls over the past few months threatening terror attacks on schools were made by a 17-year-old whose one parent had signed the petition seeking clemency for Guru, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Kejriwal owed an answer to people because of its antecedents. Describing the police findings as sensitive and serious, Trivedi claimed that the probe revealed the student's parents were associated with NGOs involved in activities considered inimical to national security.He said AAP had come out in support of those who raised ""tukde tukde"" slogans in JNU in 2015 wishing India's dismemberment and vowing revenge for Guru's death, while the Kejriwal govt had sat over Delhi Police's request for sanction for prosecution of the ""tukde tukde"" gang for years before giving in to popular pressure.""All of us know that AAP has deep bonds with NGOs who opposed Afzal Guru's hanging. In Feb 2015, 'tukde tukde' slogans were raised on Afzal Guru's death anniversary, and AAP kept the file closed for months. Who are the people behind these NGOs, and are they related to AAP? Both parents of Delhi CM Atishi supported the clemency petition for Guru. There seems to be a direct connection between these events. Is AAP involved in this?"" Trivedi, accompanied by Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, asked. Atishi's parents, Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi, were among several activists and professors who had signed a mercy petition for Guru in 2013.""I ask Arvind Kejriwal to come forward and clarify AAP's relationship with these individuals. If juveniles are doing this, what kind of venom are these NGOs injecting into the minds of our country's children? We want a clear answer from AAP. If they don't provide one, it only deepens the doubt,"" Trivedi said.""Kejriwal talks nonsense and makes false statements. I want to ask clearly if AAP will clarify its links to these horrifying and dangerous revelations because there appears to be a direct ideological similarity with you in this case,"" he added. Sachdeva said the investigation would eventually reveal the links between the NGO, AAP, and its leaders. ""It's not a coincidence. Those emails were sent to 400 schools under a well-thought-out conspiracy to create an atmosphere of fear in Delhi because they had to win the elections,"" he said.""Arvind Kejriwal is not just an enemy of Delhi but of the country as well. May Delhi be free from this 'aapda' (disaster) because they (AAP) have destroyed Delhi,"" he added.",BJP cites support of Delhi CM Atishi's parents for campaign for clemency for Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.

Cops review security of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal after intel on plot by Khalistanis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-review-security-of-former-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-after-intel-on-plot-by-khalistanis/articleshow/117247035.cms,"NEW DELHI: A security review of former Delhi CM and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has been undertaken in the wake of ""specific intelligence inputs"" about an imminent attack on him, sources have told TOI. Kejriwal has Z-Plus security . The move comes after intelligence inputs suggested that operatives of a pro-Khalistan outfit would try to assassinate Kejriwal.According to the alert, a hit squad comprising two-three men, which was last spotted in Punjab and may be headed for Delhi, would make an attempt on Kejriwal's life. ""Pakistan's ISI is behind the plot which, at the face of it, seems aimed at disrupting law and order and harmony in both states. It is a hum-int (human intelligence) and we are trying to corroborate further details,"" said the source.This is not the first time that a plot has been uncovered to target Kejriwal. In 2014, the intelligence establishment had warned of a plot being hatched by Indian Mujahideen to abduct Kejriwal in order to secure the release of its jailed chief Yasin Bhatkal. Delhi Police had then stepped up his security. Kejriwal has also been in the crosshairs of the Sikhs For Justice group. Under Z-Plus security from Delhi Police, Kejriwal has around 63 people assigned to guard him. His security apparatus comprises pilot, escort, close protection team, home guard and spotter besides search-and-frisking staff. There are around 47 people in this set-up. Apart from this, there are around 15 uniformed personnel from Central Armed Police Force (CAPF). The security rules are as per the ""yellow book"", said sources.Atishi, who took charge as CM after Kejriwal was sent to judicial custody, was accorded Z category security as per protocol. Kejriwal's security briefly changed in Tihar where, too, he had a special security arrangement. At Jail no. 2 where he was lodged, four warders were assigned to him on a rotational basis with two stationed outside his cell and another two posted near a small garden enclosure leading to his cell. Special attention was given to ensure that Kejriwal was not attacked when he stepped outside his cell to meet his lawyers or go to the common area to make phone calls or meet his family members and relatives during mulaqats.After he faced threats from Indian Mujahideen, there were some incidents of ink being thrown at him and even physical attacks, prompting a multi-layer ring of personnel around him. In April 2014, an autorickshaw driver slapped him in Sultanpuri. Two years later, in January 2016, a man threw ink on him. Just a few months later, in April 2016, another man hurled a shoe at Kejriwal. Most recently, in May 2019, Kejriwal was targeted once again during a roadshow in Moti Nagar. TOI reached out to AAP and its response was awaited.","Security review of former Delhi CM and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal has been undertaken.

UBT MLA says party has almost turned into Cong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ubt-mla-says-party-has-almost-turned-into-cong/articleshow/117245895.cms,"Mumbai: Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA and group leader Bhaskar Jadhav said on Tuesday that the party has almost turned into the Congress party Jadhav, while speaking to office bearers, mentioned that if the duration of posts such as of shakha pramukhs is fixed, only then will they compete to work within that period. ""Instead, now our party has almost become the Congress. It hurts to say this,"" Jadhav said, adding that earlier whenever there was a Shiv Sena programme in a village, the shakha pramukhs of that village would be involved.""Today, take a look at who the shakha pramukhs are, how many of them are there, and where are they? Some office bearers sat comfortably in one place for 10-15 years. They have the impression that no one can touch my post. If I serve the will of some leader, my post is intact, where are these shakha pramukhs?"" Jadhav said.Jadhav's comments come as a setback for Sena (UBT), which now faces a challenge to keep the cadre intact ahead of local body polls and prevent an exodus after the drubbing in the state assembly polls.Last Nov, 20 newly elected Sena (UBT) MLAs elected Aaditya Thackeray as legislative party leader. Jadhav was appointed as group leader of the legislative assembly, and MLA Sunil Prabhu was appointed as the whip of the legislative assembly.""There is massive disgruntlement in the party. After the poll debacle, no steps were taken to reorganise the office bearers and party structure. The same netas are still calling the shots, and nothing changed. The party is certainly facing an exodus in Konkan region, which used to be a bastion earlier. Now we don't have a single MP and only a couple of MLAs from there. Many losing candidates who were MLAs before complained to the top brass but with little or no change in the party policy,"" said a UBT functionary.Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said on Saturday his party would contest local body elections independently, signalling a significant shift in strategy for municipal polls.","Jadhav's comments come as a setback for Sena (UBT) which now faces a challenge to keep the cadre intact ahead of local body polls.

The accidental explosion occurred when the troops, during a routine patrol, stepped over a strayed mine, officials said.“The six soldiers were immediately shifted to 150 General Hospital, Rajouri, for treatment,” said an official, adding that their condition was stated as “stable”.Forward areas along the LoC are dotted with landmines as part of the anti-infiltration security grid. These mines sometimes get relocated due to soil erosion and heavy rain, triggering such accidents.","Six soldiers were injured in a landmine blast near a forward post along the Line of Control (LoC) in Nowshera sector of J&K’s Rajouri district early Tuesday.

Not a joke anymore: US lawmakers greenlight Trump bid for Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-a-joke-anymore-us-lawmakers-greenlight-trump-bid-for-greenland/articleshow/117243072.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington

: Republican lawmakers loyal to President-elect Donald Trump are legislatively green-lighting his efforts to acquire Greenland, transporting the proposal from what began as a ""joke"" to serious bid that analysts warn will sow chaos across the world.Ten Republican legislators on Monday put forth a bill that would authorize Trump to enter into negotiations with Denmark over purchasing Greenland from the moment he takes office on January 20, providing legislative cover to his bid.""Not later than 5 calendar days after reaching an agreement with the Kingdom of Denmark relating to the acquisition of Greenland by the United States, the President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees the agreement, including all related materials and annexes,"" the proposed bill said.Trump will need legislative approval for any such purchase since Congress controls the purse strings and funds to acquire Greenland will first have to be appropriated by the House of Representatives and approved in the Senate.The bill, titled the "" Make Greenland Great Again Act ,"" has been moved by Tennessee Congressman Andy Ogles and backed by ten other Republican lawmakers.Very few lawmakers have spoken against the proposal, initially considered a wacko, unrealistic idea, although some MAGA radicals have said it is a distraction to the more urgent task of bringing down prices and making life more affordable for workaday Americans.But Trump surrogates are suggesting that acquiring Greenland will be a quick and painless process and will buoy the US economy instantly. Trump has also indicated that Greenland is ripe for picking, sending his son Don Jr for a ""recce"" and thanking Greenlanders for welcoming him warmly. Trump supporters have been buttressing the idea by distributing clips of some Greenlanders welcoming a US acquisition and declaring their opposition to Denmark, which currently controls Greenland.Trump supporters are also pointing to statements from Denmark seeking talks with US to suggest the country is ready to strike a deal. Acquiring Greenland, which is about 2/3 the size of India, would increase the area of continental USA by 20 per cent. MAGA proponents of the idea have joked that its population of 56000 could be overrun by six policemen.Some US analysts are warning that the idea is not funny. ""Trump’s remarks are reckless stupidity beyond belief,"" NYT columnist Thomas Friedman warned on Tuesday in an oped titled ""Trump’s Reckless Greenland Comments Are Not a Joke"" in which he mused about what message it could sent China's leader Xi Jinping as he eyes Taiwan and to Vladimir Putin who has invaded Ukraine.""Some may think Trump’s remarks on taking Greenland and the Panama Canal are just a joke from an attention-seeking leader with no filter. They are not a joke. They are a prescription for chaos. They have already done more damage than people realize. If Trump persists with them, the joke will be entirely on us and on the world order we established after World War II,"" Friedman wrote.",Ten Republican legislators on Monday put forth a bill that would authorize Trump to enter into negotiations with Denmark over purchasing Greenland.

From Sean 'Diddy' Combs protection plot to woke politics: LA wildfires spark surge of wild conspiracy theories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-sean-diddy-combs-protection-plot-to-woke-politics-la-wildfires-spark-surge-of-wild-conspiracy-theories/articleshow/117226022.cms,"California wildfires (AP Photo)

Here are some conspiracy theories that are running wild on the internet:

Wildfire Destroys Diddy's 'Freak-Off' Mansion? Internet Alleges Key Proof Lost

Fire to cover up crimes of Sean Diddy Combs?

Hollywood sign on fire

Fact or Fiction: Hollywood sign catches fire amid LA blazes?

Women's handbags used to fight the blaze

Governor clearing land to build apartments

Firefighters turned away due to safety issues in fire equipment?

Cause of fire- Arson or directed energy weapons

'Government plot'



Woke politics hampered rescue and relief, claim MAGAs

As the California wildfires continue to devastate the region, a wave of conspiracy theories has emerged, sparking widespread debates and confusion.From claims linking the fires to cover-ups involving Sean ""Diddy"" Combs to accusations of government plots and mismanagement, these unverified rumors are gaining traction online. While experts emphasize environmental factors like climate change and infrastructure issues as the primary causes, the wild theories are adding to the chaos surrounding the disaster.One wild theory linked the fires to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. Rumors suggested that the fires were deliberately set to destroy evidence connected to allegations of abuse and misconduct tied to Diddy’s infamous parties.Diddy has faced over 100 allegations of sexual misconduct, including accusations of rape and child abuse, allegedly occurring at drug-fueled gatherings at his Los Angeles estate. Some claim a “Diddy list” exists, naming high-profile celebrities who attended these parties. While the list remains unverified, its rumored existence has fueled speculation.Adding to the intrigue are bizarre claims of secret tunnels connecting Diddy’s Holmby Hills mansion to other properties, including the Playboy Mansion and Michael Jackson’s former home. Online chatter suggests these tunnels could have been used for illicit activities, though no evidence supports their existence. Some dismiss the idea as an exaggerated online joke.Former US government official Catherine Austin Fitts stoked the fire, questioning how many of those spared by the wildfires were connected to Diddy.Despite the rumors, there is no official evidence connecting Diddy to the wildfires or confirming the existence of the alleged tunnels or list.Some people claimed that the iconic Hollywood sign in LA and shared footages of the flames engulfing the sign. However, wit was later confirmed that the viral videos were AI-genrated with one even having the Hollywood sigh with 3 Ls. Also ,Jeff Zarrinnam, who serves as the chairman of the Hollywood Sign Trust, has verified that the iconic landmark remains undamaged and in its proper position, according ti LA Times.A viral video during the California wildfires led to widespread misinformation about firefighters using women's handbags to combat the blazes. However, a Los Angeles Fire Department representative quoted by CBS News clarified that the footage showed personnel utilising standard-issue canvas bags, which are routinely employed to control minor fire outbreaks.A misleading social media post on X spread unfounded allegations about Governor Newsom collaborating with developers to alter zoning regulations in Pacific Palisades' burnt areas. Newsom directly refuted this claim stating, ""This is not true.""The unsubstantiated rumour suggested that the governor was coordinating efforts to modify zoning classifications in Pacific Palisades, specifically changing single-family residential zones (R1) to multi-unit residential zones (R3) to facilitate apartment construction.Theories circulated claiming that Oregon firefighters were turned away from assisting in the L.A. firefight because their equipment failed emission tests. However, these claims were quickly disproved. Oregon firefighters actively joined the firefighting efforts. LA County fire chief Anthony Marrone addressed the rumors during a Monday news conference, stating, “The LA County Fire Department has never turned down any offers for mutual aid assistance and resources,"" adding that the equipments passed all safety check.Several people including celebrities have alleged that the recent fires in Los Angeles could be the result of arson. Actor Henry Winkler expressed his anger on X, writing, ""May you be beaten you unrecognizable!!! The pain you have caused!!!"" Meanwhile, singer Chris Brown questioned the situation, saying, ""Someone starting these fires. S— don’t add up"" TV personality Peta Murgatroyd shared a warning about men in ski masks allegedly setting fires, and Elizabeth Chambers reposted claims that the fires seemed suspicious. Podcaster Andrew Huberman also shared a video, alleging that people were lighting fires in non-burning areas of the city. Despite these claims, the Los Angeles Police Department has stated that they have not received any reports of arson.Meanwhile, a Facebook post last week claimed that directed energy weapons (DEWs) caused the wildfires in Los Angeles in 2025, referencing a McDonald's restaurant burning down in a wooded area. The image shown was actually from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California, not the 2025 fires in Los Angeles.According to the US Government Accountability Office, concentrated electromagnetic energy forms the basis of directed energy weapons, which are designed to cause damage or destruction to adversary targets. In recent years, numerous social media posts have incorrectly associated these weapons with significant fire incidents, despite no evidence supporting such claims.Some other theorists alleged how numerous palm trees remained intact while surrounding vehicles and residences were destroyed, using this observation to bolster their unfounded claims of ""DEW attacks"". ""Cars and homes are burned but trees are still standing,"" wrote a social media commenter, insinuating that a deliberate assault had specifically aimed at destroying personal property.Accusations emerged from conspiracy theorists who alleged government involvement in starting the Los Angeles fires. These claims extended to assertions that authorities possessed weather manipulation capabilities, supposedly using them to intensify winds and expand the fire's reach.Alex Jones, the discredited conspiracy theorist, posted on X suggesting that the fires were ""part of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse."" Musk endorsed this unfounded assertion by responding with ""True"" to Jones's post.MAGA supporters, including Elon Musk, have blamed California’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies for the wildfires. They argue that DEI initiatives, which prioritize diversity over qualifications, have weakened essential services like the fire department and misallocated resources. Critics say that funds spent on social programs have taken away from disaster preparedness, creating a situation where identity politics takes precedence over public safety.However, many experts disagree with this argument, pointing out that DEI hiring policies don’t compromise qualifications for critical roles. They argue that the wildfires are caused by environmental factors such as climate change, droughts, and poor infrastructure, not by diversity policies. California’s history of fire management issues, outdated infrastructure, and inadequate disaster planning are also bigger contributors to the crisis.","Theories linking the fires to cover-ups involving Sean ""Diddy"" Combs are gaining traction online.

Former US Presidents in attendance





Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, scheduled for January 20, is shaping up to be a star-studded and politically significant event, with an array of high-profile attendees confirmed.Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg will attend the ceremony, NBC News reported, citing an unnamed official involved in the event’s planning. The three influential tech moguls will be seated together on the platform alongside prominent guests, including Trump’s cabinet nominees.Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the majority owner of X, has emerged as one of Trump’s closest allies. His presence at the inauguration is unsurprising, given his alignment with Trump’s hard-right politics and his financial support for the presidential campaign. Musk’s role in Trump’s administration is already taking shape, as he has been tapped to co-lead an advisory commission dubbed the department of government efficiency (DOGE), aimed at reducing federal spending and bureaucracy.Bezos and Zuckerberg, while less closely aligned with Trump, have made efforts to cultivate a relationship with the president-elect.External affairs minister S Jaishankar will represent the country at the ceremony, following an invitation from the Trump-Vance inaugural committee.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also confirmed her invitation, stating that she hopes to attend if her schedule permits.China’s President Xi Jinping will send a high-level envoy to represent Beijing, while Argentine President Javier Milei—breaking tradition—plans to attend the event himself.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has received an invitation but has yet to announce his decision, and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has also been invited despite facing legal troubles and a ban from running for political office in Brazil until 2030.Joe Biden has confirmed his attendance, dismissing the controversy surrounding his presence as “childish games.”Several former US presidents will also be present, including Barack Obama, George W Bush, and Bill Clinton. They will be accompanied by their spouses, with the exception of Michelle Obama, who has opted to skip the event.Trump’s inauguration marks a break from certain traditions, with his team extending invitations to several international leaders and former heads of state, signaling a global stage for the event.","Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg will attend the inauguration.

A United Airlines passenger's attempt to calm his nerves became a legal issue as he ended up urinating in his seat and aisle. 34-year-old American climate research analyst Zachary Greear ended up getting a two-month suspended sentence by the Dublin district court for his disruptive behavior on the transatlantic flight from Amsterdam to New York after he mixed Xanax with alcohol to beat his anxiety.Greear pleaded guilty to three offences under Ireland's Air Navigation and Transport Act: intoxication, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour, and causing annoyance onboard an aircraft, as reported by the Guardian.The court heard that during the flight, Greear became highly intoxicated and urinated in his seat and in the aisle, causing the captain to make the decision to divert the plane to Dublin, dumping €30,000 worth of fuel.Greear's solicitor, Eoghan O'Sullivan, said his client was ""horrified and embarrassed"" by his behaviour and had offered a ""most sincere apology"". The judge suspended the jail sentence for two years, describing Greear's behaviour as ""appalling"", but noted his written apology and compliance with an order to pay €10,000 for damages he caused.At Monday's hearing, O'Sullivan indicated his client's willingness to compensate for the diversion costs, initially offering $5,000.The judge deemed this amount insufficient and demanded double the sum, emphasising the serious impact on flight crew, passengers, and airline operations. “Can you imagine the fear and trauma he caused to a pilot who is trying to manage people safely on his aircraft, to passengers, to employees of the airline who have to dump fuel and turn around a flight and land in a jurisdiction they never expected to be in?” the judge questioned.The Garda (national police force of Ireland) stated that on arrest, Greear ""couldn't understand where he was"" due to his level of intoxication but had since apologised. He had no previous convictions.","Zachary Greear, 34, mixed Xanax with alcohol to calm his anxiety.

Trump’s Defence Secy Grilled By U.S. Senators | Key Moments From Pete Hegseth Confirmation Hearing

Pete Hegseth , President-elect Donald Trump 's nominee for Defence Secretary, defended himself during his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, pledging to instil a ""warrior culture"" at the Pentagon if confirmed.Hegseth stressed that his leadership would prioritise readiness, strength, and military discipline, citing his own experience in the Army National Guard as a foundation for transforming the military’s culture.“It’s time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm,” Hegseth declared, aiming to bring change to an institution he sees as bogged down by bureaucracy.Despite Hegseth’s defence, the hearing quickly turned into a confrontation, as senators questioned him about past allegations of sexual assault and reports of excessive drinking. Hegseth was asked directly about a 2017 accusation, which he dismissed as part of a “smear campaign.” He also responded to questions about his behaviour, pledging that he would abstain from alcohol if confirmed for the position.Senators raised additional concerns about Hegseth’s lack of senior military and national security experience, which is typically expected from a Defence Secretary nominee. He was also grilled over his previous views on women in combat, a stance he had softened since his nomination.On diversity, Hegseth opposed current policies, claiming that modern diversity and inclusion initiatives “divide” the troops and do not prioritise merit.Despite the controversies, Hegseth’s Republican allies continued to back his nomination, calling him a “breath of fresh air” and a leader capable of shaking up the Pentagon.With a Republican-controlled Senate, Hegseth's confirmation could depend on whether he can win over enough votes from both parties. The over four-hour hearing marked the beginning of a weeklong marathon, with the Republican-led Senate working swiftly to confirm some of Trump's nominees before Inauguration Day on January 20.","Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Defence Secretary, defended himself during his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.

Who is Yoon Suk Yeol?

South Korean authorities on Wednesday arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol, a month after his brief declaration of martial law.After authorities entered his residence to arrest him, South Korea's impeached President Yoon agreed to appear at the office of investigators probing him for insurrection, his lawyer confirmed.In a pre-recorded video message, Yoon said that he did not accept the investigation's legality but complied to prevent ""bloodshed."" He also claimed that the ""rule of law has completely collapsed"" following his detention.Following his arrest, Yoon can be held for up to 48 hours under the current warrant. Investigators would need to apply for a new warrant to extend his custody. Yoon's presidential powers were suspended after the opposition-dominated assembly impeached him on December 14, accusing him of rebellion.Also read: Yoon agrees to appear for probe after officials enter presidential compound His fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which began deliberating his removal or reinstatement. The court held a brief hearing on Tuesday, but Yoon’s absence delayed proceedings. A new hearing is scheduled for Thursday, and the trial will continue regardless of his attendance. Yoon was impeached in December 2024 by a 204-85 vote.This was the the second attempt to detain Yoon. Over 1,000 police and anti-corruption officers were involved in a multiday operation to detain Yoon, who had been staying in his Seoul residence for weeks.Also read: S Korea presidential security chief says must be 'no bloodshed' over Yoon arrest Yoon had justified his martial law as necessary to counter an ""anti-state"" opposition. Despite a detention warrant, the presidential security service had blocked earlier efforts, and tensions escalated with Yoon's supporters and critics protesting nearby. Yoon's lawyers had been negotiating his voluntary questioning, but his arrest now shifts focus to the Constitutional Court's deliberations on his impeachment.On January 3, investigators from South Korea’s anti-corruption agency had failed to detain impeached Yoon at his residence after a six-hour standoff. Presidential security services blocked their entry, citing safety concerns.Yoon has been at his residence since December 12, following his martial law declaration and subsequent impeachment.

TAIPEI: The Ministry of National Defence (MND) on Wednesday detected 24 aircraft from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and six vessels from the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) operating around Taiwan until 6 a.m. (UTC+8).According to the MND, 21 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern, and eastern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ).Sharing a post on X, MND wrote, ""24 PLA aircraft and 6 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today.""It added, ""21 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern and eastern ADIZ. We have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.""On Tuesday, the MND detected 22 PLA aircraft of various types, including J-16, KJ-500, and others. Out of 22 PLA aircraft, 19 crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered the northern, central, southwestern and eastern ADIZ in conducting air-sea joint training along with other PLAN vessels.Earlier on January 13, the Ministry detected six aircraft from the PLA and six naval vessels from the PLAN as of 6:00 am (UTC+8), with four of the aircraft crossing the median line and entering Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ.In recent weeks, China has been visibly boosting its ability to invade Taiwanese beaches with innovative new naval equipment. This includes the formal launching of an enormous landing helicopter assault (LHA) vessel, the likes of which no other navy in the world possesses, and mass production of floating bridge docks to assist the unloading of ships during beach landings. Both type of equipment are strong indications that China is serious about one day invading Taiwan.The Taiwan-China issue is a complex and longstanding geopolitical conflict centred on Taiwan's sovereignty. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates its own government, military, and economy, functioning as a de facto independent state.However, China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and insists on the ""One China"" policy, which asserts that there is only one China, with Beijing as its capital.This has fuelled decades of tension, especially since the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), when the ROC government retreated to Taiwan after the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, took control of mainland China.Beijing has consistently expressed its goal of reunification with Taiwan, using diplomatic, economic, and military pressure to isolate Taiwan internationally. Meanwhile, Taiwan, supported by a significant portion of its population, continues to maintain its independence.","The Ministry of National Defence (MND) on Wednesday detected 24 aircraft from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and six vessels. 21 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern, and eastern Air Defence Identification Zone.

Gov. Abbott orders flags at full staff for Trump's inauguration

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday announced that flags at the US Capitol, currently at half-staff to honour former President Jimmy Carter, would be temporarily raised on January 20 to mark Donald Trump’s second term.“On January 20th, the flags at the Capitol will fly at full-staff to celebrate our country coming together behind the inauguration of our 47th President, Donald Trump,” Johnson stated.The decision defies President Joe Biden’s proclamation of a 30-day mourning period for Carter, who passed away on December 29 a the age of 100. According to Johnson, the flags will return to half-staff the day after the inauguration, continuing the tribute to Carter until January 28, as per US flag code .Trump had publicly criticised the prospect of lowered flags during his inauguration, calling it unprecedented and accusing Democrats of relishing the moment. However, according to a New York Times report, flags have historically flown at half-staff during an inauguration if it falls in the mourning period. President Richard Nixon’s 1973 ceremony occurred under similar circumstances, following President Harry Truman’s death.Meanwhile, Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida raised its flags shortly after Carter’s funeral, ignoring state directives to keep them lowered.“No American can be happy about this,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier this month.It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors, reported The Associated Press. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that flags in their states would also be raised for Inauguration Day.“While we honour the service of a former president, we must also celebrate the service of an incoming president,” Abbott stated. DeSantis echoed this sentiment, citing the day’s patriotic importance.The order affects flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at US embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels.However, the White House confirmed there would be no changes to Biden’s original order. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that the 30-day mourning period would remain in effect at federal facilities.","Gov. Abbott orders flags at full staff for Trump's inauguration.

Questions on sexual assault, infidelity

On women in combat roles

Donald Trump's defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth faced an excruciating hearing by the senate for his confirmation in which several aspects of his life, his past comments were scrutinized. While Hegseth is not new to controversy, a video is going viral now claiming that Hegseth forgot one of his kids' names as he was introducing his family. ""Sorry, it's a lot of them,"" Hegseth said as he fumbled on Rex's name. But he did not actually forget the name. He just got stuck which he admitted and overcame.Out of the seven children, four are Hegseth's biological and three are his stepchildren. He shares one daughter with his current wife Jennifer and shares three other kids with his second wife Samantha Deering. Hegseth is a stepdad to Jennifer's three children.Pete Hegseth is one of the most controversial candidates in the incoming Trump cabinet. He was accused of sexually assaulting a woman and then paying her years later. Hegseth said it was a consensual act but he was blackmailed into paying the woman, Though Hegseth was not charged, the accusations surfaced after he was picked by Trump as his defense secretary.At the hearing too, the allegations came with Dem reps questioning him on that incident.""I am shocked that you would stand here and say you're completely cleared,"" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said.""Those were false charges, it was fully investigated and I've been completely cleared,"" Hegseth responded.""You've admitted that you had sex at that hotel in October 2017,"" Kaine said. ""You have admitted that you had sex while you were married to wife two after you just had fathered a child by wife three. You've admitted that,"" Kaine emphasized, suggesting that, ""if it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be secretary of defense.""""It was a false claim then, it's a false claim now,"" Hegseth said.Sen. Joni Ernst, who is a female veteran of the Iowa National Guard, pressed Hegseth on his prior comments speaking out against women serving in combat roles. “I did serve in Kuwait and missions in Iraq, so it is incredibly important I stress — and I hope that it confirmed you continue to stress — that every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and do so at any level, as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward,” the Iowa Republican said.“I want to know again — let's make it very clear for everyone here today — as Secretary of Defense, will you support women continuing to have the opportunity to serve in combat?”Hegseth agreed, saying that “women will have access to ground combat roles, given combat standards remain high.”","Pete Hegseth is one of the most controversial candidates in the incoming Trump cabinet.

They should never have been in prison,"" Fonseca told AFP.One person was killed and dozens injured in the protests, which Havana accused Washington of orchestrating.According to official Cuban figures, some 500 people were given sentences of up to 25 years in prison for participating, but rights groups and the US embassy say the figure is closer to 1,000.Some have already been freed after serving their sentences.- 'Diverse crimes' -Cuba welcomed Washington's announcement Tuesday as a step in the ""right direction,"" but lamented it was still under US sanctions in place since 1962.The foreign ministry later announced that 553 people imprisoned for ""diverse crimes"" will be released.Cuba blames the US blockade for its worst economic crisis in decades, marked by shortages of fuel, food, medicines and electricity.Trump's first presidential term from 2017 to 2021 saw a tightening of sanctions against Cuba that had been loosened during a period of detente under his predecessor Barack Obama.Before assuming office, Biden had promised changes in US policy towards the island, but postponed these after Havana's crackdown on the 2021 protests.Analysts say the Covid-19 pandemic, which tanked tourism, and economic mismanagement by the government have contributed greatly to the poor state of the economy.But Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel has described US sanctions as ""genocidal"" and said his country was prepared for ""more difficult circumstances"" after Trump's election.The incoming president's allies immediately criticized Biden over Tuesday's announcement, with Ted Cruz -- a Cuban-American member of the US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee -- calling it a ""rank appeasement of the Cuban regime.""Trump has nominated Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American highly critical of communism and the left at large, to serve as his secretary of state.A White House statement said Biden would also waive part of the so-called Libertad Act underpinning the US embargo of Cuba.Biden would also rescind a Trump-era policy called ""National Security Presidential Memorandum 5,"" ending restrictions on financial transactions with certain Cuban entities.Colombia's leftist President Gustavo Petro and a political party made up of the country's disarmed ex-FARC guerrilla group, welcomed the White House announcement.Cuba had hosted the talks from 2012 to 2016 that saw the FARC agree to lay down arms.","Cuba says it will release 553 prisoners in response to Washington removing the communist country from its list of terror sponsors.

Jack Smith's report says there was enough evidence to convict Trump in election case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/special-counsels-report-says-there-was-enough-evidence-to-convict-trump-in-election-case/articleshow/117248841.cms,"US special counsel Jack Smith concluded that Donald Trump engaged in an ""unprecedented criminal effort"" to hold on to power after losing the 2020 election, but was thwarted in bringing the case to trial by the prez-elect's Nov election victory, according to a report published on Tuesday.The report details Smith's decision to bring a four-count indictment against Trump, accusing him of plotting to obstruct the collection and certification of votes following his 2020 defeat by Democratic President Joe Biden. It concludes that the evidence would have been enough to convict Trump at trial, but his imminent return to the presidency, set for Jan. 20, made that impossible.Smith, who has faced relentless criticism from Trump, also defended his investigation. ""The claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,"" Smith wrote in a letter detailing his report.After the release, Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, called Smith a ""lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the election"". Trump's lawyers called the report a ""politically-motivated attack"" and said releasing it ahead of Trump's return to the White House would harm the presidential transition.Much of the evidence cited in the report has been previously made public. But it includes some new details, such as that prosecutors considered charging Trump with inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol under a US law known as the Insurrection Act. Prosecutors ultimately concluded that such a charge posed legal risks and there was insufficient evidence that Trump intended for the ""full scope"" of violence during the riot, a failed bid by a mob of his supporters to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. The indictment charged Trump with conspiring to obstruct the election certification, defraud the US of accurate election results and deprive US voters of their voting rights.A second section of the report details Smith's case accusing Trump of illegally retaining sensitive national security documents after leaving White House in 2021.The justice department hasn't made that portion public while legal proceedings continue against two Trump associates charged in the case.Smith, who left the justice department last week, dropped both cases against Trump after he won last year's election, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. Neither reached a trial. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.","US special counsel Jack Smith concluded that Donald Trump engaged in an ""unprecedented criminal effort"" to hold on to power after losing the 2020 election.

The US House of Representatives on Tuesday approved legislation that would prohibit federal funding for K-12 schools that allow transgender students to participate in women's sports teams. The bill, which passed largely along party lines with a vote of 218-206, faces a significant challenge in the Senate, where it would require support from seven Democrats to overcome a filibuster.House speaker Mike Johnson said that it was a great day for America, as House Republicans passed representative Greg Steube's Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which guarantees that men cannot compete in women's sports.""Today is a great day in America because House Republicans just passed @RepGregSteube's Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act ensuring men cannot compete in women’s sports. Men are men, women are women, and men cannot become women. It’s just that simple,"" Johnson said in a post on X.Republicans argue that the bill is necessary to protect women's rights and ensure a level playing field for female athletes. Representative Greg Steube, the bill's sponsor, said, ""The overwhelming majority believe men don't belong in women's sports. This bill will deliver upon the mandate the American people gave Congress .""Democrats, however, criticized the bill as a dangerous invasion of privacy for young girls and an example of Republicans' ""creepy obsession with your kids' private parts,"" according to representative Jim McGovern. They also pointed out that the legislation targets a small and vulnerable population of transgender children who already face higher rates of bullying and mental health issues.Representative Lori Trahan, the only former division I college athlete serving in Congress, acknowledged legitimate concerns about transgender athletes competing in women's sports at the highest levels but questioned the involvement of politicians in the issue.The decision to bring up the bill in the second week of Congress suggests that Republicans believe the issue remains politically advantageous. During the 2024 presidential election season, the Trump campaign spent a significant portion of its ad budget on television ads addressing transgender issues.Democrats spent more time raising concerns about the bill's potential to infringe upon girls' privacy, arguing that it could lead to invasive questioning about their bodies. Representative Katherine M. Clark said, ""This doesn't protect a girl's rights, it eliminates them. It puts a target on the back of every girl, every young woman who chooses to play sports.""The debate also included disagreements about how the legislation would be enforced, with Republicans suggesting that reviewing birth certificates would suffice, while Democrats argued that this method would be unreliable due to the existence of intersex individuals.Two Democrats, representatives Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, voted in favor of the bill, while representative Don Davis of North Carolina voted ""present.""Last week, a federal judge in Kentucky struck down US President Joe Biden 's effort to expand protections for transgender students and make changes to the rules governing sex discrimination in schools.",US House of Representatives passes bill barring transgender athletes from women's sports teams.

The US will also reduce some economic pressure on Cuba and revise a 2017 memorandum issued by former President Donald Trump that toughened the US stance toward the island nation.Cuba said that it will free 553 prisoners following removal from US terror list.However, the decision by the outgoing Democrat president is expected to be reversed soon after Trump, the Republican president-elect, takes office and Marco Rubio becomes secretary of state, according to a report by news agency Associated Press. Rubio, whose family left Cuba before the communist revolution led by Fidel Castro, has long advocated for sanctions against Cuba.In the final days of Trump's first administration, on January 11, 2021, the White House had reinstated Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, citing its support for Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and refusal to extradite Colombian rebels, among other issues.Biden's administration has determined that there is ""no credible evidence"" that Cuba currently supports international terrorism. Congress and the incoming Trump administration will have the opportunity to review and potentially reverse Biden's actions.Representative Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, criticized the move, saying, ""President Biden is a pathetic coward.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.

Tulip Siddiq: UK minister linked to Hasina graft probe quits govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-minister-linked-to-hasina-graft-probe-quits-govt/articleshow/117246749.cms,"This is a Reuters' copy

The British minister responsible for financial services and fighting corruption resigned on Tuesday after weeks of questions over her financial ties to her aunt Sheikh Hasina , ousted last year as PM of Bangladesh.Tulip Siddiq , 42, had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and PM Keir Starmer said last week he had full confidence in her.The resignation of a second govt minister in two months is a blow to Starmer, whose approval ratings have plunged since his Labour Party won a general election in July. Late last year, transport minister Louise Haigh quit after acknowledging a minor criminal offence before she entered govt.Siddiq was handed the portfolio for financial services policy after the election, a role that included responsibility for measures against money-laundering. In a statement, Siddiq said although an investigation into her financial affairs found she had not breached the ministerial code of conduct, her position was ""likely to be a distraction from the work of the govt"". ""I have therefore decided to resign from my ministerial position,"" she said. Starmer swiftly appointed Emma Reynolds, who was a pensions minister, to Siddiq's role.Siddiq was named in Dec as part of Bangladesh's investigation into whether her family were involved in siphoning off funds from Bangladeshi infrastructure projects. The anti-corruption commission alleged financial irregularities worth billions of dollars in the awarding of a $12.65 billion nuclear power contract, saying Hasina and Siddiq may have benefited. After facing further scrutiny over the use of properties in the UK tied to Hasina and her supporters, Siddiq referred herself to the govt's independent ethics adviser.",Tulip Siddiq had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and PM Keir Starmer said last week he had full confidence in her.

Climate activists targets Charles Darwin’s grave with '1.5 is dead' message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/watch-climate-activists-targets-darwins-grave-with-1-5-is-dead-message/articleshow/117223454.cms,"'1.5 is dead': Just Stop Oil activists paint over Charles Darwin grave

Two activists from the group Just Stop Oil (JSO) painted Charles Darwin ’s grave at Westminster Abbey with the message ""1.5 is dead."" This action, carried out on Monday morning, follows the announcement that global temperatures have surpassed the critical 1.5°C threshold set by the Paris Agreement. The protest, which was aimed at drawing attention to the urgent need for the UK government to phase out fossil fuels, has sparked significant controversy.The two activists, named by JSO as Alyson Lee, 66, a retired teaching assistant, and Di Bligh, 77, a former council CEO, entered the historic Abbey at around 10.00am and used spray chalk to inscribe their message on the grave of the famed biologist.JSO said that the act was a response to the news that global temperatures had exceeded the 1.5°C warming limit for the first time, with the group quoting the alarming figures released by Europe’s climate monitor. “2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe,” the group’s press release read.Both Lee and Bligh were arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of criminal damage. Police confirmed that they had been detained at the scene and taken to a central London station where they remain in custody. “Police were called following reports that the women had been detained by security,” a police spokesperson said. The spokesperson for Westminster Abbey reassured the public that the damage was temporary, and there was no lasting harm to the site.In their statements, the protesters explained the motivations behind their actions. Lee described the situation as an urgent climate crisis , stating, “Ten years on from the Paris Agreement, we have already exceeded the so-called safe temperature rise of 1.5 degrees... We need mass civil disobedience now, join us on the streets and help us reclaim parliament this April.” Bligh added, “We are on course to lose everything, and politicians are doing nowhere near enough to prevent it. How many will we have to bury as a result of climate breakdown and who will be left to mourn them?”The action is the latest in a series of high-profile and disruptive demonstrations by Just Stop Oil, which has targeted everything from iconic artworks to historic monuments. Previous protests have included throwing soup over Vincent van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" and spraying paint at Stonehenge. JSO’s aggressive tactics have drawn both praise for highlighting the urgency of climate action and criticism for disrupting public life and heritage sites.This latest protest comes as Los Angeles grapples with devastating wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, and as the world faces increasingly severe environmental challenges.",Two Just Stop Oil activists painted over Charles Darwin's grave at Westminster Abbey on Monday.
