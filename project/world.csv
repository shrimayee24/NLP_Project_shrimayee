"After Trump assassination attempt, BJP's reminder of PM Modi's rally attack in 2013",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trump-rally-attack-after-trump-assassination-attempt-bjps-reminder-of-pm-modis-hunkaar-rally-attack-in-2013/articleshow/111727437.cms,"NEW DELHI: As former US President and Democrat presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when a registered Republican opened fire at him on Sunday, the Bharatiya Janata Party drew parallels to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's 2013 election campaign, which was marred by six consecutive bomb blasts .Referring to the 2013 incident, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared a news article and said, ""Never forget: When Narendra Modi was the prime ministerial candidate in 2013, six blasts went off during his rally in Patna.The terrorists had originally planned to assassinate PM Modi using a suicide bomber.""Condemning attacks on world leaders, Malviya remarked, ""The world is becoming increasingly unsafe. We've seen attacks on Shinzo Abe, then Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, and now Donald Trump. The threat is real. Vile global Left networks are at work, demonising popular and powerful leaders, plotting to bring them down so that they can control elected governments and stamp their hegemony.""On October 27, 2013, as PM Modi stood on stage at the ‘Hunkar Rally’ in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan, bombs exploded. Six people were killed, and in 2021, nine terrorists were convicted for the attacks, with four receiving death sentences. The blasts occurred between 11:40 am and 12:45 pm. Investigations revealed that the terrorists initially planned to assassinate PM Modi with a suicide bomber but opted for bomb explosions to cause a stampede, providing a chance to target PM Modi in the chaos.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) found that the accused had conducted reconnaissance of PM Modi’s rallies across the country and concluded that attacking PM Modi with firearms was nearly impossible due to his tight security. According to the NIA's charge sheet, ""They decided to explode IEDs at the election rally in Patna, intending to kill many people, causing a stampede in which Modi could be targeted from close range.""A special NIA court held nine members of the banned terror outfit SIMI guilty of the 2013 serial blasts that killed six people and injured 89 at PM Modi's rally. One of the ten accused, Fakkruddin, was acquitted due to lack of evidence. The court of additional district and sessions judge Gurvinder Singh Malhotra will pronounce the sentences on November 1. Special public prosecutor Lallan Prasad Sinha said the NIA would seek capital punishment for at least five of the nine convicts.Five of the convicts – Haider Ali (alias Black Beauty), Imtiaz Ansari, Umer Siddique, Azharuddin Qureshi, and Mujibullah Ansari – are already serving life terms for the Bodh Gaya Mahabodhi blasts three months before the Patna attack. The other four convicts are Numan Ansari, Ahmad Hussain, Mohammad Feroz Aslam, and Mohammad Ifteqaar Alam. One of the original 12 accused had been convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board, Patna.""The original plan was to assassinate PM Modi through suicide bombing, but the terrorists gave up that plan after a recce showed that his fortress-like security cover would be hard to penetrate,"" the special public prosecutor said. PM Modi was then the chief minister of Gujarat.The NIA discovered that the terrorists detonated a suicide vest tied to a palm tree in Ranchi's Sithiyo area while preparing for the serial blasts. The conspiracy unraveled with the arrest of Imtiaz, who was injured during an accidental blast at Patna railway junction on the day of PM Modi's rally. Another suspected SIMI terrorist, Tariq Ajam Ansari, was killed while inserting a pencil battery into an IED inside a public toilet on platform number 10 of the station. Three IEDs were defused at the rally venue later.","BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared a news article and said, ""Never forget: When Narendra Modi was the prime ministerial candidate in 2013, six blasts went off during his rally in Patna.

Your work will get done quickly.' I told him that I would file a police complaint against you to which he said 'You can't do anything to me. I have seen a lot of women like you, I'll get you fired.'""The incident came to light after a video of the female employee slapping the CISF ASI at Jaipur Airport on Thursday went viral. Following a complaint filed by ASI Prasad, the police arrested the SpiceJet employee. In his complaint, Prasad alleged that during a disagreement regarding security screening procedures at the airport, the employee slapped him.However, the SpiceJet employee, who has been working with the airline for five years, refuted these claims. She said that she had a valid airport entry pass and was well-versed with the rules and regulations. She also mentioned that there is usually a female staff member present in the morning, but not at night and that they coordinate with the female staff on a daily basis.She said, “Their [ASI Prasad's] statement that I was forcing to go inside and that I did not have a valid card is wrong. We meet CISF staff every day but usually, we coordinate with the female staff. We do not even talk to the male staff on a daily basis...There is a female staff member there in the morning every day, but there are no female staff members at night. It happens every day that we take the catering van, give them the slip and we go towards the departure hall. There is never any female staff there.”SpiceJet has issued a statement supporting their employee and has approached the local police to take legal action against the CISF personnel for sexual harassment. The airline said, ""SpiceJet is taking immediate legal action in this serious case of sexual harassment against its female employee and has approached the local police. We stand firmly by our employee and are committed to providing her with full support.""Earlier, advocate Deepak Chouhan, the legal representative for the SpiceJet Airlines employee accused of slapping a CISF assistant sub-inspector at Jaipur Airport, claimed that his client was subjected to 'sexual harassment' by the police officer, which provoked her to take such action.Speaking to ANI on Friday, Advocate Deepak Chouhan said, ""The SpiceJet employee has been arrested. She was sexually harassed by the CISF ASI at Jaipur Airport. Abusive words were used against her, which caused her to lose her cool and slap the CISF officer . This was her natural response to the incident.""The advocate also stressed that the female employee had no prior history of such behaviour, suggesting that this was an isolated incident triggered by the alleged harassment.""In court FIR, we have mentioned that the woman had not displayed such behaviour in the past. Had this been her usual behavior, such incidents would have come to light earlier. However, this is a matter of investigation,"" Advocate Chouhan added, indicating that the case requires further inquiry to establish the facts surrounding the incident.","SpiceJet employee arrested for slapping a CISF assistant sub-inspector at Jaipur Airport.

Donald Trump: Did this immigration chart save Donald Trump's life?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-this-immigration-chart-save-donald-trumps-life/articleshow/111742335.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump has credited an immigration chart for saving his life after an assassination attempt at a campaign rally on Saturday. Trump was presenting a chart of border-crossing statistics when gunfire erupted, with at least five shots fired towards the stage. As the shots rang out, Trump was seen holding his ear and quickly getting down on the ground.Secret Service agents immediately formed a protective shield around him. Trump then stood up, his face bloodied, and pumped his fist to cheering supporters before leaving the scene with his motorcade to a medical facility in Pennsylvania.The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of domestic terrorism. The gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was fatally shot by Secret Service agents after firing at Trump. The motive for the attack remains unclear, with Crooks’ political affiliations appearing mixed based on his donation history and voter registration. Bomb-making materials were found in Crooks' vehicle and home, described by officials as “rudimentary.""Trump described the near-miss, saying, “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” adding, “Much bleeding took place.” He credited his quick glance at the chart with saving his life, explaining, “If I hadn’t pointed at that chart and turned my head to look at it, that bullet would have hit me right in the head.”Reactions to the incident included a brief, supportive call from President Joe Biden , who stressed unity and resilience. Trump praised the Secret Service's response and confirmed he would continue with his campaign schedule, including the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The attack has led to increased scrutiny on political violence and security measures at campaign events.Trump's former White House physician, Rep Ronny Jackson, recounted Trump's gratitude towards the border patrol chart in a conversation with The New York Times. Trump described the events as happening “so quickly,” and expressed amazement that he survived the incident. Jackson noted, ""He wasn’t the least bit flustered.""A bystander, Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief, was killed during the attack, and two others were critically wounded. Governor Josh Shapiro praised Comperatore, saying, “His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them.” The two wounded bystanders were reported to be in stable condition.On Sunday, Trump addressed his supporters on social media, calling for unity and resilience. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,"" he wrote.The attack has temporarily reshaped the presidential campaign landscape, drawing attention to the risks faced by political figures and the polarized state of American politics. It has also prompted a reassessment of security protocols at political events, with both parties urging supporters to remain calm and unified in the face of violence.","Former US President Donald Trump has credited an immigration chart for saving his life after an assassination attempt at a campaign rally on Saturday.

Secret service had one job. Did it fail its duty?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-service-had-one-job-did-it-fail-its-duty/articleshow/111742189.cms,"The US Secret Service is trying to figure out how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former Prez Donald Trump at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, a monumental failure of one of the agency’s core duties.The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue”, the agency said.An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos, as well as satellite imagery, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the ex-prez was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a man wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of Butler Farm Show grou nds, where Trump’s rally was held.The roof was less than 150 metres from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 metres is a distance at which US army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The ARstyle rifle used by the shooter is the semiautomatic civilian version of the military M16.The FBI on Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20. FBI special agent in charge Kevin Rojek said it was “surprising” that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. The FBI said it will lead the probe into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement.Two witnesses at the rally clai med to have seen the shooter, with one saying he saw the gunman apparently scouting for a perfect perch to shoot at the former US prez. According to attendee Ben Macer, he “saw the guy move from roof to roof”, CBS News reported. Macer said he told an officer that the shooter was on the roof, approximately “200 to 250 yards” away from where Trump was addressing. “When I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos”.Butler resident Ryan Knight, another witness along the fence line, also said he saw the suspected shooter atop the American Glass Research building, the CBS report said. “My main thought is why wasn’t the Secret Service on top of AGR? That’s a very big vantage point to shoot at the president. How did that get missed?” Knight asked.Calls for an investigation came from all sides. James Comer, a Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he has called on Secret Service direc tor Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Some even called for Cheatle’s resignation. Rep Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating “security failures”. US secretary of homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to probe the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates is one of the department’s “most vital priorities”, he said.The Secret Service, meanwhile, denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected campaign requests for additional security. “In fact, recently the Secret Service added protective resources and capabilities to the former president's security detail,” a spokesperson said.(With inputs from AP,PTI)","US Secret Service is trying to figure out how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former Prez Donald Trump.

Theodore Roosevelt gave a speech with a bullet in his chest at a comeback event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/theodore-roosevelt-gave-a-speech-with-a-bullet-in-his-chest-at-a-comeback-event/articleshow/111742312.cms,"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump is not the first former president to survive an assassination attempt while trying to reclaim his old office. More than a century ago, Theodore Roosevelt was shot just before he was scheduled to go onstage at a campaign event -- and went ahead to give his speech anyway with a bullet in his chest.Roosevelt's gritty response to the attack in 1912 proved to be the stuff of legends and helped cement his reputation for toughness.To that point in US history, three other presidents had been killed by assassins, including William McKinley, whose death elevated Roosevelt, then the vice president, to the presidency. But as of then, no current or former president had been shot without dying.Roosevelt, like Trump, was staging a comeback attempt, running again four years after moving out of the White House. Unlike Trump, Roosevelt had left office voluntarily, declining to run in 1908 after serving nearly two terms. Instead, he had helped elect his protégé, William Howard Taft. But within four years, the two had a falling out and Roosevelt decided to challenge Taft for the presidency.Although Taft beat him for the Republican nomination at the GOP convention, Roosevelt broke off from his old party to form the Progressive Party, also known as the Bull Moose Party , so that he could compete in the fall contest against Taft and Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic governor of New Jersey.On October 14, 1912, Roosevelt was in Milwaukee, coincidentally the same city where Trump is scheduled to be nominated this week. As Roosevelt left the Gilpatrick Hotel to head to a nighttime speaking event, a man named John Schrank approached and opened fire with a Colt revolver. Several men tackled Schrank, but Roosevelt stopped the crowd from killing him on the spot.Roosevelt, 53, was saved by a metal eyeglasses case and the fat text of his speech, 50 pages folded over so that it was 100 pages thick, in his pocket. But the bullet, even slowed down, still penetrated his chest and he found blood on his hand when he searched for and found a dime-sized wound. Allies wanted to take Roosevelt to the hospital, but he insisted on proceeding to the auditorium to deliver his address first. And thus followed one of the most extraordinary speeches in presidential campaign history.""I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot,"" Roosevelt told the astonished crowd as he got started. ""But it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose!""He apologized that as a result he might not be able to speak as long as normal -- and then proceeded to give a 90-minute stemwinder. Only at that point did he agree to be taken to the hospital. The bullet had been headed straight for his heart before stopping, lodged against a rib 4 inches from the sternum.Schrank was what is today called a lone wolf, an individual acting outside of any network. When Roosevelt, just shot, asked him why he had done it, Schrank had ""the dull-eyed, unmistakable expressionlessness of insanity,"" as Edmund Morris put it in the final volume of his famous three-book account of Roosevelt's life.Schrank told authorities that he had had visions of the slain McKinley calling for Roosevelt's death and he had thought that it was his responsibility to stop Roosevelt from breaking George Washington's tradition of serving no more than two terms, long before the 22nd Amendment formally put the limit in the Constitution.The attempt on his life ""captured the imagination of the country,"" H.W. Brands, a historian at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in ""T.R.,"" another biography of the 26th president. But as impressive as Roosevelt's performance that day had been, it did not propel him to victory. He finished ahead of Taft but, having split the Republican vote, was defeated by Wilson. Unlike a later president, Roosevelt conceded defeat. ""Like all other good citizens,"" he told reporters, ""I accept the result with good humor and contentment.""","Theodore Roosevelt was shot in 1912 while trying to reclaim his old office.

FBI Director Christopher Wray on Sunday said that the top investigative agencies' authorities ""will leave no stone unturned"" and are ""committed the full force"" in their investigation .The US investigative agency chief called the shooting an “attack on democracy and democratic process"" of the world's oldest democracy. “An attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate can only be described as absolutely despicable and will not be tolerated in this country,” Wray said.The firearm used in the attempted assassination , identified as an AR-style 556 rifle, was legally purchased. Authorities believe the semi-automatic weapon was acquired by the shooter's father, though they are uncertain about how the shooter accessed it or whether he took it without his father’s knowledge.“These are facts that we'll flesh out as we conduct interviews,” Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh Field Office was quoted as saying. The FBI said it is also investigating the Trump rally shooting as an attempted assassination and also an act of "" domestic terrorism "".The gunman was not previously known to the FBI and is believed to have acted alone. Authorities have not yet identified any specific motive or made a case for any ""threatening"" or incriminating content on social media.During their investigation, the FBI located and safely defused a suspicious device, and they have received over 2,000 tips related to the incident.

The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen.

A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals.

He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years. While finding the situation shocking, she admired the resilience of Afghan activists. The Malala Fund is advocating for the UN to formally expand its definition of crimes against humanity to include ""gender apartheid,"" a term used by the UN to describe the situation in Afghanistan.Malala criticised the recent talks between the UN and the Taliban in Doha, which took place without the presence of women. She called for a ""principled engagement"" with the Taliban and urged world leaders to realize that excluding women and girls from such discussions is doing the Taliban a favor.She specifically called out countries with feminist foreign policies, such as Canada and France, to condemn such conversations.Furthermore, Malala called for an urgent ceasefire in the ongoing war in Gaza, expressing concern over the bombing of schools in the region. She emphasized the importance of providing humanitarian support to innocent civilians and praised countries that have resumed funding for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, despite Israeli accusations of its workers being involved in Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7.","Malala Yousafzai has expressed deep concern over Pakistan's decision to deport undocumented Afghan refugees.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for. Khan’s party strength stood at 84 in the National Assembly before the decision and is expected to rise to over 100.Under Pakistan’s election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats – 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims – in proportion to the number of seats they win. This completes the National Assembly’s total strength of 336 seats.",The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday declared his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party eligible for allocation of seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.

However, the election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats , which were intended solely for political parties.The SC placed the present petitions before the three-judge committee that determines the constitution of the bench for the reconstitution of a larger bench when attorney general Mansoor Usman Awan highlighted that under Section 4 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, the present case should be heard by a larger bench since the issue concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions, Dawn reported.A day ago, the court had reserved its decision on the matter after closing the hearing on a set of appe­als moved by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).The SIC had filed a petition demanding that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to PM Shehbaz’s ruling coalition after the February 8 general elections, be reallocated to the alliance. However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters. They have been claiming that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that supervised the polls engaged in electoral fraud to prevent them from winning.
