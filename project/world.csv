Congress calls for consultation with opposition

CPM stresses unified action

Farooq Abdullah advocates diplomacy and dialogue

TMC criticizes government’s handling of the situation

NEW DELHI: The opposition parties raised concerns and urged the government to take a more inclusive approach by engaging the opposition in handling the sensitive issue as tensions escalated between India and Canada.The diplomatic fallout between India and Canada over the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Sikh separatist leader, has led to a series of tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats and a suspension of visa services.Nijjar, a Canadian citizen labeled as a terrorist by India in 2020, was killed in British Columbia earlier this year, sparking a diplomatic confrontation.India has strongly refuted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claims, saying that the assertions made by Canadian officials about presenting evidence in the Sikh extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar case are untrue, according to government sources quoted by ANI. India also dismissed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) allegations that Indian agents use criminals in Canada to target the South Asian community, particularly ""pro-Khalistani elements,"" citing a lack of specific evidence.Here’s how key opposition figures responded to the ongoing India-Canada diplomatic row:Congress leader Jairam Ramesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage opposition leaders in discussions on the diplomatic crisis.In a post on X, Ramesh expressed concern about the deteriorating relations, saying, “The Indian National Congress certainly hopes and expects that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take into confidence the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses of Parliament and the leaders of other political parties on this extremely sensitive and critical issue ofIndia-Canada relations .”Rashid Alvi, another Congress leader, told ANI, “It is a matter of great concern. When such a thing happens, it shows that our relations with that country are not good...Earlier, such things never used to happen. It has started under the BJP government .""The Communist Party of India (Marxist) urged the government to brief opposition parties on the evolving situation with Canada. The party highlighted that anti-India Khalistani elements operating in Canada have long posed a threat to India's national security.“The Government of India is duty-bound to protect the national interest for which it has the support across political parties in India,” the CPM said. The party also raised concerns about allegations from Canada regarding India's role in Nijjar's killing, asserting that these claims should be addressed with transparency.The CPM also said that ""activities of anti-India Khalistani elements operating in Canada have been a matter of serious concern"" and called for unity among Indian political factions in defending the nation’s interests.National Conference President Farooq Abdullah urged India not to sever diplomatic ties with Canada, suggesting that both countries should strive for peaceful negotiations. He raised questions about of the allegations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.""I regret this situation; we should establish a friendship...We should not stray from the path of diplomacy,"" Abdullah said, adding that India should continue to deny the allegations unless presented with clear evidence.TMC MP Sagarika Ghose took to social media to criticize the Modi government for its handling of the diplomatic row, accusing it of evading accountability. She questioned why Canada’s accusations have not been addressed transparently.“The head of another government and its police publicly accuse the Modi-led government of shocking criminal activity on its soil, and no one is supposed to ask for answers from the non-biological PM Narendra Modi?” Ghose wrote on X.",Opposition parties urge the government to take a more inclusive approach by engaging the opposition in handling the sensitive issue. The diplomatic fallout between India and Canada over the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar has led to a series of tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114268785,imgsize-1493145,width-400,resizemode-4/114268785.jpg"
Taiwan: Record 153 Chinese military aircraft fly around Taiwan airspace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/record-153-chinese-military-aircraft-fly-around-taiwan-airspace/articleshow/114235654.cms,"A member of the Taiwan Coast Guard monitors a China Coast Guard boat as it passes near the coast of Matsu islands, Taiwan. (Picture credit: AP)

Taiwan reported the detection of 153 Chinese military aircraft around its airspace, marking a record number in a single day, according to official data released on Tuesday, reported the news agency AFP.The surge in aircraft sightings followed large-scale military drills conducted by China, which included fighter jets, drones, warships, and coast guard boats encircling the island.The 25-hour period leading up to 6:00 am (local time) on Tuesday saw Taiwan's defence ministry on high alert, as 111 of the detected aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, a previously respected boundary between mainland China and the self-governed island.The drills come at a time when tensions are constantly rising between Taipei and Beijing . Taiwan’s President, Lai Ching-te ’s administration has pledged to protect Taiwan’s democracy.In response, Taiwan deployed its own ""appropriate forces"" and heightened the alert status of its outlying islands. The island’s government condemned China’s manoeuvres as ""irrational and provocative,"" while the United States described the actions as ""unwarranted"" and warned that they risked escalating tensions in the region.Japan also expressed concerns, with its government monitoring the situation closely and scrambling fighter jets near its southern Yonaguni Island. Japan’s deputy chief cabinet secretary, Kazuhiko Aoki, confirmed that the concerns were conveyed to Beijing.China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. The latest exercises, named Joint Sword 2024B , are the fourth round of large-scale drills in just over two years, with Beijing signalling them as a warning to pro-independence movements in Taiwan.Lai, who has been more vocal about defending the island’s sovereignty compared to his predecessor, reiterated his commitment to resisting annexation and safeguarding national security.","Taiwan reported the detection of 153 Chinese military aircraft around its airspace, marking a record number in a single day.

'EVMs more robust than Hezbollah pagers': EC shoots down Cong claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/evms-more-robust-than-hezbollah-pagers-ec-shoots-down-cong-claim/articleshow/114262468.cms,"NEW DELHI: 'Our EVMs are more robust than Hezbollah 's pagers' was the EC's response to the claim of Congress 's Rashid Alvi who cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""friendship"" with Israel to allege that EVMs could be manipulated just like the pagers in Lebanon and urged the opposition to demand voting through paper ballots.Referring to pagers and walkie-talkies with Hezbollah which were allegedly turned into exploding devices by Israel, and the PM's good relationship with Israel, Alvi, a former MP and Congress spokesperson, said, ""In Maharashtra, the opposition should put pressure to insist on voting by paper ballot and not EVMs.Otherwise, BJP govt and EC can do anything. If Israel can kill people by use of pagers and walkie-talkies, then where does EVM stand? The PM has very good relations with Israel. Israel is an expert in such things. EVM ka bada khel kahin bhi ho sakta hai aur uske liye BJP chunav se pehle yeh sab khel kar leti hai.""Dismissing Congress's accusations of EVM tampering in Haryana polls, chief commissioner Rajiv Kumar said the machines were ""100% foolproof"" and ""can't be hacked like (Hezbollah) pagers used for blasts"".""EVMs cannot be hacked. Pagers are connected devices but EVMs are not,"" he said. He added that similar accusations were made earlier, with allegations that votes cast for one party could go to another.Reacting to Alvi's claim, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said, ""Congress seems to have lost both its political intellect as well as the plot. In loss, they flog the same EVMs that also wins them votes and states. No wonder there is a regular flight of leaders from Congress towards saner political quarters, BJP being the primary beneficiary.""Hezbollah had switched to pagers and walkie-talkies at the instance of its chief Hassan Nasrallah who was scared of mobile phones and suspected that devices belonging to members of the group were hacked by Israeli agencies. He had asked Hezbollah members to destroy their mobile phones to evade detection by Israeli agencies. It turned out to be a grave error as Israeli agencies infiltrated the supply chain of pagers by setting up a front company which gained the franchise from the Taiwanese manufacturer of the devices, and rigged them with explosives which could be set off by sending an encrypted message.With Hezbollah firing missiles at Israel, the encrypted message was delivered to the pagers on Sept 17, setting off explosions which killed more than a dozen and maimed thousands. A day later, this was followed by Hezbollah walkie-talkie sets also going off as part of an audacious operation by Israel. Israel has, however, not claimed responsibility for the innovative warfare.","Congress's Rashid Alvi cited PM Narendra Modi's ""friendship"" with Israel to allege that EVMs could be manipulated.

Anti-hero Bollywood movies trying to avenge an ancestral wrong is a hit Bollywood plot, tried and tested on the box offices time and again.

""Jo Salman Khan aur Dawood gang ki help karega apna hisab-kitab laga ke rakhna (whoever helps Salman Khan and the Dawood gang, keep your accounts in order),"" it said.According to Delhi Police records, while Bishnoi has never personally killed anyone, he has risen to become one of the most feared gangsters, allegedly operating his gang with ""impunity"" from a Gujarat prison and employing methods reminiscent of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar.Bishnoi himself entered the criminal world during his time at Panjab University in 2010, when he opened fire at a rival during student body elections, resulting in a three-month jail sentence. Despite this setback, he went on to win the student union presidency while completing his graduation.Convicted in four criminal cases in Punjab, Bishnoi faces charges of extortion, murder, attempt to murder, and violations of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). He initially operated primarily in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi, before expanding his activities into Maharashtra.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) reports that Bishnoi commands a gang of around 700 members nationwide, including sharpshooters, and collaborates with other infamous gangsters such as Goldy Brar, Sachin Thapan, Anmol Bishnoi, Vikramjit Singh, Kala Jatheri, and Kala Rana.","Lawrence Bishnoi, also known as Balkaran Barar, is a jailed gangster from Punjab, India.

At times, Siddique didn’t turn up, and when he did, they were forced to abandon the plan because he was surrounded by too many of his supporters.’’Meanwhile, police on Tuesday arrested one more accused in the case, Harishkumar Nishad (24), from Kaisarganj in UP. He was remanded in police custody till Oct 21. Three others were earlier arrested: the two alleged shooters — Gurmail Singh (23) and Dharmaraj Kashyap (21) — and milk dairy owner Praveen Lonkar .Milk dairy owner Praveen Lonkar is the brother of Shubham Lonkar, whose social media post connected Siddique’s killing to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang.Nishad used to run a scrap shop in Pune city. Pune police officials told TOI that the owner from whom Nishad took the shop on rent last year said it has been shut for over two weeks and had no idea where he had gone. The shop is next to Praveen’s dairy. Nishad brought some youngsters from his home district to work at the shop.Police have seized a motorcycle he purchased that was given to the alleged shooters for conducting reconnaissance. “Praveen gave Rs 60,000 to Nishad to buy a second-hand bike. Nishad rode this bike from Pune to Mumbai and handed it over to the shooters near their rented room in Kurla. The shooters used the bike for carrying out recce of Siddique. It was bought with Nishad’s documents,” said another senior officer. Shubham allegedly also gave Rs 4 lakh to Praveen, who later distributed it among the shooters and co-conspirators over a period of time. Police claimed to have found a bag containing a weapon that the alleged shooters left behind while fleeing after killing Siddique.Meanwhile, the initial police investigation indicates that the Lawrence Bishnoi gang wanted to convey a message to actor Salman Khan that they are not to be ignored. The gang had fired at Salman Khan’s Bandra residence on April 14. Siddique was said to be close to Khan, who was a regular at the politician’s fabled iftars. Lawrence, currently in Sabarmati jail for various criminal activities, had previously threatened Khan, swearing revenge for the actor’s alleged involvement in the poaching of blackbucks, which are sacred to the Bishnoi community. Security has reportedly been tightened around Khan. Moreover, Lawrence wants to make an impact in the city considering that not many gangsters are active, an officer said.Police said Singh and his handler and wanted accused, Zeeshan Akhtar (24), worked for the Vikram Brar group, which is associated with the Bishnoi gang . “Shubham had once gone to Punjab and met Zeeshan. Their modus operandi is to enlist young and poor people to carry out killings,” said the officer.

US election 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman predicts Kamala Harris will be first woman president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-nostradamus-allan-lichtman-predicts-kamala-harris-will-be-first-woman-president/articleshow/114221428.cms,"US historian and political scientist, Allan Lichtman (ANI)

Prominent American historian and political scientist Allan Lichtman , renowned for his accurate track record in predicting U.S. presidential elections, has forecast that the country will elect its first female president, with Kamala Harris expected to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.Lichtman, a distinguished professor at American University, developed a prediction model called the ""Keys to the White House,"" which has accurately predicted the outcome of every U.S. presidential election since 1984. The system, created in collaboration with Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981, adapts methods originally designed for earthquake prediction. It operates on 13 key indicators, and according to Lichtman, if six or more of these keys go against the incumbent party, they are likely to lose the election; fewer than six, and they are predicted to win.In an interview with ANI, Lichtman says that there are only four keys that work against the incumbent Democrats, which means that Donald Trump will not be returning to the White House.""The White House party (Democrats) loses key 1, the mandate key because they lost US House seats in 2022. They lost key number 3, the incumbency key because the sitting president was not running. They lose key number 12, the incumbent charisma key because what you may think of Harris, she's only been a candidate for a little while.She's not reached the status of a Franklin Roosevelt. And she loses key number 11, the foreign policy failure key, because the Middle East is a disaster, a humanitarian crisis with no good end in sight,"" the historian said.“That's four keys down, two keys short of what would be needed to predict Donald Trump's return to the White House and Harris losing. So the keys predict we're going to have a new pathbreaking president, our first woman president, and the first president of mixed Asian and African descent, kind of foreshadowing where America is going. We're rapidly becoming a majority-minority country. Old white guys like me are on the decline,"" he said.Speaking on the factors that work in Democrats' favour, Lichtman said there has been no recession in the election year, the third-party campaign has fizzled and Republicans have been unsuccessful in putting up a scandal against the Democrats.""Well, as I said, they're only losing four. That means they're winning nine keys. The contest key, was because the Democrats united around Harris. The third-party key, because the campaign of RFK Jr. has fizzled. The short-term economic key, because there's no recession in the election year.The long-term economic key, because real per capita growth under the Biden term has vastly exceeded the average of the previous two terms. They win the policy change key because policies under Biden are fundamentally different from those under Trump.They win the social unrest key because the earlier sporadic demonstrations have fizzled away. They win the scandal key. Republicans have been trying for four years to pit a scandal on Biden and have come up empty”, Litchman said.""They win the foreign policy success key because it was Biden and Biden alone who put together the coalition of the West that stopped Putin from conquering Ukraine, as many predicted, and moving on to threatening America's NATO allies and undermining America's national security. They win the challenger charisma key because whatever you may think of Trump as a showman, he doesn't fit the definition of the key, which is a once-in-a-generation, across-the-board, inspirational candidate.He only appeals to a narrow base. In four years as president, his approval rating was just 41 per cent, right at the bottom, historically, of presidents. And in two consecutive elections, he lost the vote of the people by a combined 10 million votes. So that's why there are nine keys in favour of the Democrats,"" he further said.Vice President Kamala Harris, is the first woman, first Black, and first Asian American Vice President. If elected president, the 59-year-old would become the first woman in history to become the US president.She is up against former President Donald Trump, who is eyeing a historic return to the White House after a bitter exit in 2020. If he wins, it would be the first time in over 100 years in US history, that a President would serve two non-consecutive presidential terms, wrote ANI.The US presidential polls are scheduled to be held on November 5. Asked about whether there can be different winners among Democrats and Republicans in terms of electoral college and popular votes, Lichtman said he hasn't made any prediction on that aspect.He also emphasized that the keys don't change in the swing states which essentially decide the US election results and stood with his prediction of Harris win.The political scientist also termed the October surprise a major event that changed poll outcome ahead of the November poll -- as the ""biggest myth"" in American history.""The October surprise is the biggest myth in American history. I've predicted all my elections, 10 elections, this is my 11th, well before any October surprise. We had the biggest October surprise ever in 2016 when Donald Trump was recorded on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women. A lot of pundits were saying, he's finished, he's done. I never changed my prediction of a Trump win, which proved to be correct,"" he said.Speaking on the two candidates, he further said that Trump is an inward-looking leader who is against the collective security of America's allies, while Harris is a 'typical' American president who believes in working with the allies. He also said that today America's standing is ""vastly better"" than what it was under four years of the Trump administration.“Trump is an America first president or candidate, either one. He believes in turning inward. He's against collective security with our allies. Many times he's trashed our NATO alliance and our NATO allies are very worried about a Trump presidency.

China is afraid of Google: Donald Trump

Former US President Donald Trump recently said that Google is rigged and it only has bad stories about him. In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait, Trump mentioned that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight the issue. “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said.Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.When asked, ""Should Google be broken up,"" Trump said “Yeah, look, Google’s got a lot of power. They’re very bad to me. Very, very bad to me. I can speak from that standpoint. They only have bad stories... in other words, if I have 20 good stories and 20 bad stories, and everyone’s entitled to that, you’ll only see the 20 bad stories. I called the head of Google the other day and I said, “I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google.” I think it’s a whole rigged deal. I think Google’s rigged just like our government’s rigged all over the place.In the interview, Trump stated “I’m not a fan of Google. They treat me badly. But are you going to destroy the company by doing that? If you do that are you going to destroy the company? What you can do, without breaking it up, is make sure it’s more fair. They do treat me very badly,”.He said that he would ""do something"" about it (Google) before adding “I give them a lot of credit they've become such a power"".""How they became a power is, you know, really the discussion,"" he said. ""At the same time, it's a very dangerous thing because we want to have great companies — we don't want China to have these companies.

US Presidential Elections: 'She'll cut her own path ...': Biden on Kamala Harris' Presidential vision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shell-cut-her-own-path-biden-on-kamala-harris-presidential-vision/articleshow/114268612.cms,"President Joe Biden speaks at a political event in Philadelphia (Picture Credit: PTI)

President Joe Biden expressed confidence that vice president Kamala Harris would ""cut her own path"" if elected president, emphasising that she could bring change to the White House .Speaking at a Democratic dinner in Philadelphia, Biden reflected on his own experience as vice president under Barack Obama, saying, ""Every president has to cut their own path. I was loyal to Barack Obama, but I cut my own path as president.That's what Kamala's going to do.""Biden highlighted Harris’s loyalty while asserting that her leadership would offer a ""fresh and new"" perspective on the country’s challenges, in contrast to Donald Trump ’s ""old and failed"" approach.Biden added: ""Kamala's perspective on our problems will be fresh and new. Donald Trump's perspective is old and failed and quite frankly thoroughly totally dishonest.""Harris took over as the Democratic Presidential nominee in July after 81-year-old Biden stepped from the race. ""When I decided it was time to pass the torch to the next generation, I knew.

He said, ""What's wrong with this guy?""Biden further condemned Trump for his stance on immigration, ""Trump hides all his racism, now it's all out front. He has the same ideas on race as the 1930s.

A Chinese aquarium in Shenzhen, Xiaomeisha Sea World , has sparked outrage after unveiling a mechanical whale shark as its star attraction, reported the New York Post.Reopened on October 1 after five years of renovations, the park drew approximately 100,000 visitors during its week-long trial period.However, many were disappointed to discover that the much-anticipated whale shark was, in fact, a robot.Photos shared by visitors show visible gaps in the mechanical shark's body, leading many to criticise the aquarium for creating unrealistic expectations. Angry guests took to social media, calling the robot ""uninteresting"" and voicing their frustrations over the high entry fee of around $40.Earlier, Chinese zoos have been accused of misleading people by swapping or modifying animals. The recent case came into the limelight when a zoo in China painted dogs to resemble pandas.Xiaomeisha Sea World defended the decision, explaining that the robotic whale shark adheres to laws prohibiting the trade of live whale sharks . However, this did little to appease disgruntled visitors, with one stating, ""I’d rather they didn’t have one at all than show a fake one.""Complaints were also made regarding the live exhibits, with some guests pointing out the poor health of the fish, claiming some displayed signs of white spot disease.","Aquarium in Shenzhen, Xiaomeisha Sea World has sparked outrage after unveiling a mechanical whale shark as its star attraction.

Journalist Olivia Nuzzi ’s ex-fiancé, Ryan Lizza , has made shocking claims in a recent court filing at Washington, DC’s Superior Court last week about her relationship with RFK Jr This legal battle follows Nuzzi’s filing of a no-contact order against Lizza, in which she accused him of harassment, blackmail related to an affair, and allegedly hacking her devices.According to Lizza’s filing, Nuzzi described RFK Jr, who is married to actress Cheryl Hines , as a “70-year-old sex addict” who told her he wanted to ‘possess,’ ‘control,’ and ‘impregnate’ her.” She claimed that he manipulated her due to a “huge power disparity.” She characterised the affair as “toxic, unhealthy, stupid, psychotic,” and expressed regret over it.Lizza, who works as Politico’s chief Washington correspondent, denied Nuzzi’s accusations in the filing, as reported by the New York Post. He refuted claims that he leaked details of her affair, to her editors at New York Magazine or to the media, stating that he had actually encouraged her to disclose the relationship to her superiors, which she refused to do.Lizza also denied hacking her devices and claimed that he learnt everything about the nearly year-long affair after Nuzzi’s tearful admission as she tried to mend their relationship.Lizza, 50, described Nuzzi, 31, as a heartbroken lover who desperately tried to save their engagement after he ended it in August. The court documents also revealed that Nuzzi repeatedly contacted Lizza after their breakup, begging him to rekindle their relationship.Lizza also said that this was not Nuzzi's first affair and blamed a previous one for derailing their joint book deal in 2020.Nuzzi is on leave from New York Magazine since the news broke in September.Robert F. Kennedy Jr stated that he and Olivia Nuzzi met only once and told The Wall Street Journal that Ryan Lizza’s account of their relationship was inaccurate.Nuzzi’s attorneys also responded to Lizza’s court filing, stating, “We reiterate that Lizza intends to harass and humiliate Nuzzi, using the press to do so—issues that prompted her to seek a protective order in DC Superior Court. This filing, filled with salacious and irrelevant claims, only furthers his harassment. Nuzzi’s goal in seeking legal intervention is to ensure her safety and to be left alone.”Nuzzi allegedly started sexting with Robert F.

UN says Yemen risks being dragged into Mideast conflict that could spiral out of control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/un-says-yemen-risks-being-dragged-into-mideast-conflict-that-could-spiral-out-of-control/articleshow/114267052.cms,"UNITED NATIONS: Yemen risks being dragged further into the military escalation in the Middle East that keeps intensifying and could spiral out of control, the UN special envoy for the Arab world's poorest nation said Tuesday. Hans Grundberg told the UN Security Council that regrettably Yemen is part of the escalation - and he warned that repeated attacks on international shipping by its Houthi rebels ""have significantly increased the risk of an environment disaster"" in the Red Sea.Both Grundberg and the UN's acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya urged the Iranian-backed Houthis to halt their attacks on international shipping, which the rebel group began to support fellow Iranian-backed militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack in Israel that sparked Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.The U.N. officials also demanded the release of dozens of UN personnel, staff of non-governmental organizations and diplomatic missions, and members of civil society, most detained since June.Msuya called the Houthis' recent referral of a significant number of those detained for ""criminal prosecution"" unacceptable and accusations against them false. She said three are UN personnel - two from the Paris-based UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and one from the Geneva-based UN human rights office. They were detained earlier in 2021 and 2023.Days after the June detentions, the Houthis said those being held were members of what they called an ""American-Israeli spy network,"" an allegation vehemently denied by the UN, NGO organizations, governments and others.The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen's internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks vanished after the Oct. 7 attack, which killed about 1,200 people in Israel, mainly civilians, and saw about 250 taken hostage, with about 100 still being held. . Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities.Grundberg told council members ""Yemenis continue to yearn and work for peace,"" but he said hopes for progress to end the escalating violence in the Middle East ""seem distant.""""Now, like many in the Middle East, their hopes for a brighter future are falling under the shadow of potentially catastrophic regional conflagration,"" he said.The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started a year ago. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors, and have seriously disrupted traffic in the Red Sea which once saw $1 trillion in goods move through it in a year.Grundberg said the Houthi attack on the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in August narrowly avoided an environmental disaster and warned that repeated attacks increase the risk of an environmental catastrophe.In response to the Houthi attacks, a US-led coalition has carried out airstrikes in Yemen, and the Israelis have attacked the port of Hodeida, a key location for delivery of aid and commercial goods which are critical as the country is reliant on imports.Msuya said the U.N. is ""very alarmed"" at the ongoing attacks on Hodeida and the smaller port of Ras Issa. The airstrikes damaged critical energy and port infrastructure but she said both ports are able to receive commercial and humanitarian imports.""Power stations throughout Hodeida city are, however, running at very limited capacity,"" Msuya said, and the UN is assisting health facilities to continue essential services.Last month, Msuya told the council the UN was cutting back its activities in Yemen in response to the Houthi crackdown on staff working for the UN and other groups.She warned the council on Tuesday that despite escalating needs, the arbitrary detentions and ""false accusations against them continue to significantly hinder our ability to provide life saving humanitarian assistance in Yemen.""""The humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to worsen, both in scale and severity,"" Msuya said, and ""hunger continues to rise.""The number of Yemenis without enough to eat ""soared to unprecedented levels"" in August, and in Houthi-controlled areas severe levels of food deprivation have doubled since last year, she said.Msuya said the UN appeal for $2.7 billion for Yemen this year to help 11.2 million people is 41% funded. She said $870 million is needed urgently, and warned that without the additional funds 9 million Yemenis across the country won't get emergency food aid in the last quarter of this year.While cholera continues to spread, with more than 203,000 suspected cases and over 720 deaths since March, Msuya said cholera funding has already run out, and the UN's health partners have been forced to close 21 of 78 diarrhea treatment centers and 97 of 423 oral rehydration centers.","Yemen risks being dragged further into the military escalation in the Middle East.

Early voting started in Georgia on Tuesday, during which a record-breaking 2,52,000 early votes were cast, surpassing the previous day's turnout of 1,36,000 in 2020, as reported by CNN.“Spectacular turnout. We are running out of adjectives for this.” The previous first-day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling said.This vote increase highlights Georgia's role as a key battleground state, as former President Donald Trump seeks to reclaim it after losing narrowly to President Joe Biden in 2020.Former US President Jimmy Carter , who turned 100 on October 1, has also participated in Georgia’s early voting, making him the oldest former president in American history to do so.Just two months earlier, his grandson, Jason Carter, revealed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his grandfather had expressed his wish to live long enough to cast his vote for Vice President Kamala Harris As Georgia recovers from Hurricane Helene which impacted the region last month, Georgia officials confirmed thatabsentee ballots were mailed on time, with over 250,000 requests submitted and this could rise to 300,000 representing 5-6% of voters, said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.New laws tightening absentee ballot rules and limiting drop boxes, however, may reduce the appeal of voting by mail.In 2020, drop boxes were available 24/7, but now they are fewer and only accessible during business hours at election offices or early vote locations.Georgia’s law now mandates two Saturdays of early voting, with optional Sunday voting, which could contribute to sustained high turnout.Raffensperger reassured voters about the election’s security, highlighting race audits and random equipment checks on Election Day to ensure accuracy and guard against interference.","2,52,000 early votes were cast in Georgia on Tuesday, surpassing the previous day's turnout of 1,36,000 in 2020.

How US picks its president: Decoding the election process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-picks-its-president-decoding-the-election-process/articleshow/114252324.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris.

Here’s the lowdown on how America elects its head of state.

Who are the main contenders for the 2024 race?

Electoral College

Early voting and mail-in ballots

Vote counting

Swing states

Electing members of Congress

The United States presidential election is a process that goes beyond a simple tally of votes. Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College , who ultimately choose the president.Most states follow a winner-take-all system, but a few divide their electoral votes proportionally.The outcome often hinges on pivotal swing states, and although early and absentee voting is common, the official result isn’t finalized until Congress certifies the electoral votes.How is the US election winner decided?Sometimes, a candidate wins despite losing the popular vote, and certain states are more crucial than others to clinch a win.The Democratic Party has, US Vice President Kamala Harris succeeded Joe Biden on July 21, leading the ticket. She will turn 60 this month and has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, as her running mate.Former US President Donald Trump , who is running again at 78 years old, is the Republican Party candidate. Ohio Senator JD Vance, 40, is his vice-presidential candidate.Jill Stein is running for the Green Party, having previously contested in 2012 and 2016, while Chase Oliver is the Libertarian Party’s candidate.And, Robert Kennedy Jr , son of the former attorney general and nephew of US President John F Kennedy , has suspended his independent campaign and endorsed Trump.Stein’s previous runs and the Green Party’s 2020 candidate, Howie Hawkins, reflect the ongoing presence of third-party challengers, though they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two-party dominance in US presidential elections.There are numerous other candidates affiliated with other minor parties or those who are running independently, but do not have majority ballot access.A US voter does not directly vote for president. Instead, voters cast votes for electors in the Electoral College, a body that ultimately chooses the president.There are 538 electors in total, representing 435 members of the House of Representatives , 100 Senators, and 3 electors from Washington DC. The magic number for victory is 270 electoral votes — an absolute majority.Each state’s allocation of electors is proportional to its representation in Congress, so a larger state like California has more electors (55) compared to smaller states like North Dakota (3).The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically takes all of that state’s electoral votes a system used in 48 states and Washington DC. Maine and Nebraska, however, use a proportional system that can split electoral votes based on district-level and statewide results.The 2020 census altered the distribution of electors by shifting seats in the House of Representatives. For instance, Texas gained two additional seats and now holds 40 electoral votes, while states like California, New York, and Michigan each lost one electoral vote. This redistribution reflects population changes and impacts the electoral weight of different states in upcoming elections.As a result of this system, candidates can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency by securing key electoral votes, as demonstrated in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton garnered almost 3 million more votes than Trump but lost in the Electoral College.In 2000, George W Bush won the presidency with 271 electoral votes, while his opponent, Al Gore, won the popular vote by over half a million.Early voting and absentee voting also play a vital role. Although the official election date is November 5, 2024, Americans have a choice to cast their votes weeks in advance through mail-in ballots or in-person early voting.Early voting picked up in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with absentee ballots accounting for 42 per cent of the total votes cast, according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab. In total, 158 million votes were cast in the 2020 election, with absentee voting reaching a high of 66.4 million — up from 28.8 million in 2016.Trump claimed that absentee voting was “fraudulent,” but research has shown that’s a very rare scenario. In the 2022 mid-term elections, absentee voting fell to 32 per cent, but it continues to remain a crucial voting method for many Americans.Early voting is widely accessible in 47 states, along with territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In most states, voters do not need a specific reason to cast their votes early, but some states require individuals to request absentee ballots for early voting.Only three states — Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire — do not offer early in-person voting.The earliest set of results is typically known by the end of election night. Polling stations generally close between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm, with the winner often projected by 11:00 pm Eastern Time.However, the rise in mail-in ballots has led to delays in final results, particularly in swing states where margins are tight. In 2020, for instance, Joe Biden was declared the winner only after multiple days of counting in critical battleground states.Media outlets such as CNN, NBC, and ABC rely on real-time vote counts and exit polls to project winners, while the Associated Press (AP) uses a more conservative approach. The AP employs around 4,000 correspondents across the country and only declares a winner once they are certain that the remaining uncounted ballots will not change the outcome.The final step in the election process occurs in December when the Electoral College formally casts its votes. State governors or secretaries of state certify the results, and on January 6, 2025, Congress will officially count the electoral votes.The newly elected president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, marking the start of a four-year term.Swing states play an outsized role in determining the outcome of presidential elections. These states do not have a consistent pattern of voting for one party and can swing either Republican or Democrat in any given election.Key swing states in 2024 are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Winning these states is often decisive for candidates due to the significant number of electoral votes at stake.Campaigns pour millions of dollars into advertising and voter outreach in swing states. As of November 2023, Trump was leading in all but Wisconsin, highlighting how competitive these states can be.In addition to presidential votes, voters in many of these states will also be deciding on crucial local issues, including referendums on abortion rights in states like Montana and Arizona.The US presidential election is just one part of the broader voting process. On November 5, 2024, Americans will also elect 468 members of Congress, comprising 33 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives.Eleven states and two territories will hold gubernatorial elections, while various local offices and referendums will also be on the ballot. For example, a referendum in Montana will determine whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state’s constitution.These elections, along with the presidential race, form a dynamic and multifaceted process that reflects the decentralized nature of the US electoral system. Voters play a direct role in shaping not only national leadership but also local and state policies that impact everyday life.","Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College, who ultimately choose the president.

Iran halts indirect talks with US amid Middle East crisis

The White House announced on Monday that the United States has been monitoring threats from Iran against former President Donald Trump for years. It issued a stern warning to Tehran, stating that any attack on a US citizen would result in severe consequences.Calling it a security matter, the White House released a statement.""We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats.Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences,"" said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.Iran announced on Monday that it has paused its indirect discussions with the US, mediated by Oman, due to ongoing tensions in the Middle East. The two countries lack direct diplomatic relations, making Oman a key intermediary.""Currently we don't see any ground for these talks, until we can get past the current crisis,"" said Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi during a press briefing in Muscat, Oman's capital.Relations in the region have become increasingly strained. On October 1, Iran launched 200 missiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders and an Iranian Revolutionary Guards general. In response, Israel has vowed to retaliate.Oman has a history of mediating between Iran and the United States, especially since the two countries severed relations following Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.The United States remains a close ally and top military supporter of Israel, while Iran supports Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah in their conflicts with Israel.","Iran halts indirect talks with US amid Middle East crisis.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Here are five key takeaways on Charlamagne podcast:

On coming off as scripted

On decriminalising weed

On

foreign aid

'Doesn't Biden administration have to take some blame for the border'

Allegations of neglecting the Black community

Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on The Breakfast Club podcast with Charlamagne tha God to address key issues ahead of the 2024 election . During the interview, she touched on a wide range of topics, from marijuana policy to accusations that she has neglected the Black community. Recent poll data shows her trailing behind in key demographics, increasing the stakes of this conversation.Harris said that voters face two stark choices in the election, “By voting, you have two choices…two very different visions for our nation.” She warned that another Trump presidency would ""take us backward.""She also discussed her proposals for Black men and her ongoing commitment to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.When asked about why Harris comes off as very scripted and ""likes to stick to her talking points"" the VP talked about the importance of repetition in communicating her message across the country, particularly in such a high-stakes election. She admitted that delivering the same message consistently is key to helping people understand her positions. ""Repetition is important. Some people say until someone has heard something at least three times, it just doesn't stay with you,"" she explained. Harris added that she feels the ""weight of the moment"" and the responsibility she carries, saying, ""This is a margin of error race. It's tight.""One of the more controversial topics Harris addressed was her stance on marijuana, particularly given accusations that she targeted Black men for weed offences during her time as a prosecutor. Harris firmly denied these claims, saying, ""I was the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases and would not send people to jail for simple possession."" As Vice President, she has worked to lower marijuana’s classification and committed to decriminalising it if elected President.""As president, I will work on decriminalizing it because I know exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations and specifically black men,"" she said.Harris faced tough questions on the issue of sending aid to other countries while domestic issues remain unaddressed. A caller asked why the U.S. sends money overseas when people at home struggle with housing and healthcare. Charlamagne added, ""That’s one reason why America First rhetoric resonates."" Harris responded that the U.S. must remain a world leader while also meeting the needs of its citizens. She talked about efforts such as reducing prescription drug prices and increasing investment in HBCUs as evidence of her focus on domestic issues. ""So part of my plan is that we're going to give people a $25,000 down payment assistance to get their foot in the door to buy a home for first time home buyers,"" the VP said.Charlamagne cited former President Obama’s recent remarks about the unrealistic expectations placed on Presidents to solve every problem. Harris agreed, noting that while it’s important to strive for progress, it’s impossible to fix everything. ""President Obama is absolutely correct, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do anything."" She pointed to her track record in reducing Black child poverty and increasing access to homeownership as proof of her commitment to improving the lives of everyday Americans.Kamala expressed her concerns about a potential Trump victory, saying, “If Trump wins, he’s going to use this law to put anyone that doesn’t look white, in camps.” She warned that Trump’s campaign is “about instilling fear, not about hope, not about optimism.” Citing his false claims about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, she highlighted how Trump prefers to run on problems rather than fixing them.When Charlamagne whether the Biden administration shares some blame for border issues. Harris replied, “No, Charlamagne… the first thing we dropped was a bill to fix the broken immigration system”.""We did to try and get that border security bill passed, and then also an executive order that has actually reduced significantly the number of illegal crossings and tightened up what needs to happen in between ports of entry,"" she said.She rejected the title of ""border czar,"" stating, “If I responded to every name he called me, I wouldn’t be focused on helping the American people.” Harris also warned of Trump’s intentions to weaponise the Department of Justice against political opponents, stressing, “That’s not supposed to happen in America.”Harris was asked about a circulating clip that claimed she would ""do nothing specifically for Black people."" She dismissed the accusation as misinformation, stating, ""My work from the beginning of my career through today has been about supporting the Black community."" Harris cited her work on healthcare, Black maternal mortality, and her investments in HBCUs as examples of her dedication. She also underscored that misinformation is a key challenge she faces in this election, aimed at undermining her achievements.In this podcast appearance, Harris sought to clarify her positions on critical issues and combat widespread misinformation as she gears up for what she described as a ""tight"" race.","Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on The Breakfast Club podcast with Charlamagne tha God to address key issues ahead of the 2024 election.

Emhoff recalled, ""I got a one-minute or less conversation that started with, 'Where the f, were you? I need you right now.'""Emhoff said that the incident occurred during a weekend in Los Angeles when he was attending a spin class.He explained that due to a software glitch that grounded planes, he was stuck in LA for an extra day. Without his phone, he was unaware of the unfolding political drama until a friend's partner showed him Biden’s announcement letter. “I had to run to the car, and there was my phone—seven or eight messages saying, ‘Call Kamala,’” Emhoff said on the LeBatardShow.Biden's decision to withdraw, announced in July, followed growing concerns among Democratic leaders regarding his mental fitness and electability against former President Donald Trump . In a letter to the nation, Biden stated, ""It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President... I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down.""With less than 3 weeks to go recent polls show a tightening race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. A forecast by Nate Silver indicated a 50/50 split between the two candidates, highlighting a slight movement in Trump’s favour in key battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. ""There’s been about 1 point of movement toward Trump... that’s enough to take things from 55/45 Harris to a pure 50/50,"" Silver noted.An NBC poll from early October revealed both candidates tied at 48% among registered voters, a notable shift from Harris’s previous 5-point lead. This shift has intensified the campaign, with only weeks remaining until the election. Harris has also released her fitness report, questioning why Trump has not done the same, as Trump continues to cancel interviews with mainstream media outlets.","Doug Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, recounted the dramatic moment when she informed him that President Joe Biden was stepping down.

'Dying to see my Cholesterol': How Trump responded to Kamala's medical report charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dying-to-see-my-cholesterol-how-trump-responded-to-kamalas-medical-report-charge/articleshow/114267069.cms,"Kamala Harris speaks as an image of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appears on screen during a campaign rally at Erie Insurance Arena, in Erie, Pa., Monday, October 14, 2024. (AP)

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump late on Tuesday claimed that Kamala Harris is ""dying"" to see his cholesterol levels, which he says are at 180, and boasted about his supposedly ""flawless"" medical records as the presidential candidates continue to argue about their health and ability to lead the nation with only a few weeks until Election Day .The 78-year-old former president, who is now the oldest presidential candidate in US history, went on a late-night Truth Social rant, criticizing his Democratic opponent's health as ""not good"" just days after Harris released a summary of her medical records and dared Trump to follow suit.In mid-August, Trump told CBS News he would ""very gladly"" release his medical records, The Independent reported, but nine weeks later, they remain undisclosed.Democrats and healthcare experts are now urging the Republican presidential candidate to be more open about his health as concerns grow about his mental sharpness to lead the country. ""As to her completely desperate request for my Medical Statements, she is dying to see my Cholesterol (which is 180!),"" Trump wrote on his social media platform at 1:42 am ET on Tuesday. ""I have already provided them, many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless.""The former president continued by asserting that he is in much better health than Harris and the previous four presidents, once again touting his own mental acuity. ""I've put out more Medical Exams than any other President in History, and aced two Cognitive Exams (the Doctor stated that my 'cognitive exams were exceptional!'). I am far healthier than Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, but especially, Kamala,"" he said in another post.Trump then turned his attention to the vice president's own medical records, criticizing her seasonal allergies and urticaria, which were mentioned in her medical report on Saturday. ""I have just seen Kamala's report, and it is not good,"" Trump said in his scathing remark.Trump's comments came after Kamala Harris questioned the former president's health and fitness on Tuesday, following his latest town-hall event that turned into an impromptu musical performance. ""Hope he's okay,"" the Democratic candidate posted on X.Harris's campaign, which has started to aggressively challenge Trump on his health and mental stability, said that he seemed ""lost, confused, and frozen on stage"" during the Monday event. Former president Trump defended the event in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, calling it ""so different.""""It was amazing! The Q and A was almost finished when people began fainting from the excitement and heat,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social network. ""We started playing music while we waited, and just kept it going. So different, but it ended up being a great evening!""For approximately 30 minutes, the event in Oaks near Philadelphia was typical fare leading up to the November 5 election, with Trump taking friendly questions from supporters about the economy and cost of living. However, it concluded with a strange 39 minutes of music and dancing, with Trump swaying awkwardly on stage following interruptions due to medical emergencies in the crowd.""Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?"" he said.Trump has made a brief, jerky dance his signature move at the end of rallies for years, almost always to his exit song – the Village People's 1978 disco anthem ""YMCA."" On Monday, however, he remained on stage for nine songs, ranging from opera to Guns N' Roses and Elvis, with the ex-president alternating between his dance moves and standing still, staring into the crowd.Trump is now the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race following a disastrous debate that raised concerns about his own age.","The former president went on a late-night Truth Social rant, criticizing his Democratic opponent's health as ""not good"" Trump is now the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race following a disastrous debate that raised concerns about his own age.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114267286,imgsize-1001951,width-400,resizemode-4/114267286.jpg"
Prosecutors will not file criminal charges against 2 people at center of Los Angeles racism scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prosecutors-will-not-file-criminal-charges-against-2-people-at-center-of-los-angeles-racism-scandal/articleshow/114266722.cms,"A few people use Grand Park at the foot of Los Angeles City Hall, Tuesday, March 31, 2020, in Los Angeles. (AP)

LOS ANGELES: The Los Angeles city attorney's office said Tuesday that it does not plan to file criminal charges against two people who were investigated in connection with the unlawful recording of a racist conversation that rocked City Hall and prompted the city council president to resign after the audio was leaked in 2022.The local prosecutors declined to file misdemeanors against the two people, a married couple, just months after the district attorney's office announced that it would not pursue any felony charges against them.The Associated Press is not naming the two people because they were not charged. Both previously worked at the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and lived at a home that investigators traced to social media posts highlighting the controversial recording.Prosecutors could not meet the burden of proof for a case, even though the district attorney's office, in a charge-evaluation worksheet, said ""the evidence indicates that a crime was committed by one or both of these individuals.""Under California law, all parties must consent to the recording of a private conversation or phone call, otherwise the person who made the recording could face criminal and civil penalties. The state's wiretapping statutes are among the strongest in the nation and allow the ""injured party"" - the person being recorded without their permission - to sue.""After careful review, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to meet the constitutional standard of proof,"" city attorney spokesperson Ivor Pine wrote in an email to the AP on Tuesday. ""Because of this, our office will not be filing criminal charges.""The scandal was triggered by a leaked recording of crude, racist comments during a private meeting in 2021 in which four Latino Democrats plotted to expand their political power at the expense of Black voters during a realignment of council district boundaries. The recording was leaked the following year.Council President Nury Martinez and powerful labor leader Ron Hererra resigned in disgrace. Councilman Gil Cedillo's term ended weeks later, but Councilman Kevin de Leon resisted calls for his ouster - including from the White House - and he ran for reelection. He faces a runoff in November.The meeting occurred at the headquarters of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, known locally as the ""LA Fed."" The couple both worked at the LA Fed at the time.The couple's identities have been made public in court filings and media accounts. Their attorneys did not immediately respond to the AP's requests for comment late Tuesday.No other potential suspects or persons of interest in the recording have been named by investigators or prosecutors.Pine, in the city attorney's office, and a spokesperson for the district attorney did not immediately return requests for comment late Tuesday to say whether anyone else had come under investigation in connection with the case.Investigators said the recording was anonymously posted on Reddit in 2022 and that a Twitter account amplified the post. Both accounts were associated with an email account that was traced to an IP address - a numeric designation that identifies its location on the internet - and linked to the couple's home.Detectives recommended charging the couple with felony eavesdropping and illegal audio recording or wiretapping charges in relation to the recording of that 2021 conversation as well as another of a 2022 phone call between Herrera and a federation spokesperson, according to a charge-evaluation worksheet released by the district attorney's office.The district attorney declined to file felony charges earlier this year and referred the case to the city attorney's office for possible misdemeanors.Cedillo and de Leon have separate pending lawsuits against the couple.The district attorney's charge-evaluation worksheet notes that both people had ""similar motives to carry out the offense,"" but it does not detail the alleged motives. Prosecutors wrote that the evidence indicates either person, or both, made the recording.""However, it is unclear how the unlawful recordings took place, the device used to do so, or who uploaded the recordings online and created the anonymous accounts on Reddit, Twitter, and Gmail,"" the worksheet states.","The local prosecutors declined to file misdemeanors against the two people, a married couple, just months after the district attorney's office announced that it would not pursue any felony charges against them.

""I was always very good at Mathematics,"" Trump said as he added that he's all about growth and will bring companies to the country. He also said that tariff is his favorite word in the dictionary.“How does it help you take on China turning all of your allies against you?” Micklethwait asked.“Tremendously, because China thinks we’re a stupid country,” Trump said. “They can’t believe somebody finally got wise to them.”Ahead of the interview, Bloomberg's editor-in-chief said they reached out to Kamala Harris for an interview about her economic policies but she declined so far.","John Micklethwait pressed Trump at the Economic Club of Chicago over his plans to impose a universal tariff on imports and his threats to use tariffs on American companies that outsource their manufacturing.

Harris Trump Poll Today: Harris vs Trump is now 50/50 in Nate Silver's latest prediction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-and-harris-is-now-50/50-in-nate-silvers-latest-prediction/articleshow/114262112.cms,"Nate Silver has released his latest forecast and Kamala Harris-Donald Trump are literally 50/50

In his latest forecast, Nate Silver Tuesday said it's now literally 50/50 between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. ""We’re just not seeing as many Harris +3 type numbers in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as we did immediately after the debate. It hasn’t been a huge swing, but even a half point to a point makes a difference,"" the Silver Bulletin said.""There's been about 1 point of movement toward Trump in MI/WI/PA. Not much elsewhere. But that's enough to take things from 55/45 Harris to a pure 50/50,"" Nate said.Three weeks before the election, the presidential race is the most tight between vice president Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. Kamala Harris was marginally leading nationally just after the ABC debate but now Trump has narrowed the margin.The same tight race has been projected by the NBC's latest national poll in which both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are at 48 per cent support. ""In the new poll — which was conducted Oct. 4-8 — Harris gets support from 48% of registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, while Trump gets an identical 48%. Another 4% say they are undecided or wouldn’t vote for either option when forced to choose between those two major-party candidates,"" the NBC said.The NBC October figures showed a change from their September figures and it was in favor of Trump. In September, Harris was leading Trump by 5 points, 49 per cent to 44 per cent.On betting platform Polymarket, Donald Trump cracked 58 per cent for the first time against Harris.The campaign has now become intense with only a few weeks left for the election. Kamala Harris released her fitness report and questioned why Trump was not doing the same. Donald Trump, meanwhile, backed out o an interview with CNBC, making it the second time that he canceled a mainstream press interview -- the first was 60 Minutes.Joe Kernen, the “Squawk Box” co-anchor, broke the news of the unannounced interview’s cancellation during Tuesday morning’s broadcast. “Well, Trump canceled, and he was going to come on,” he said. Kernen added that the network had also offered to sit down with Vice President Kamala Harris, but said “she’s not coming on.” Kernen joked that, with Trump’s decision, “she could come on and we could say we offered it to Trump camp, but they’re not.”","Nate Silver has released his latest forecast and Kamala Harris-Donald Trump are literally 50/50.

Islamabad 'lockdown' greets Chinese PM amid aftershocks of Karachi suicide attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/islamabad-lockdown-greets-chinese-pm-amid-aftershocks-of-karachi-suicide-attack/articleshow/114231377.cms,"ISLAMABAD: PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days as Pakistan pulled out all stops to avoid any safety slip-up during the first visit by a Chinese premier to the country in 11 years.Li's four-day trip to oversee the signing of bilateral trade and economic agreements, inaugurate an international airport in the southwestern port city of Gwadar, and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit comes just over a week after a suicide attack near Karachi airport in which two Chinese engineers died and 11 others were wounded.As PM Shehbaz Sharif and members of his cabinet received Li at the Chaklala airbase in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, adjacent to Islamabad, news arrived of at least three cops and as many militants being killed during an attack on the district police headquarters in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.A wave of violence has swept Pakistan lately, including 21 miners being shot and killed in Balochistan, where the new Gwadar airport is located. Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad. The administration announced a three-day public holiday in the capital city, beginning Monday, with contingents of police, army and paramilitary forces out on the streets in what appeared to be a veritable lockdown.The SCO participants include the PMs of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India's foreign minister, S Jaishankar, and Iran's vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, are also expected at the summit.Jaishankar has already stated that he wouldn't discuss bilateral ties with Pakistan during his visit, the first in nearly a decade.The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan announced a protest Tuesday in Islamabad if the govt did not allow his family members, lawyers and doctors to meet him in prison.","PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days.

At least 28 students, including girls, from various campuses of a well-known private college in Lahore, were injured during clashes with the police as they protested against the alleged on-campus rape of a female student, police said on Monday. The protests erupted Monday morning across at least four boys' and girls' campuses of the Punjab Group of Colleges , owned by the Dunya media group , following reports that a female student at the Gulberg girls' campus in Lahore was raped allegedly by a security guard in the institution's basement.As news of the alleged rape spread on social media, students from various campuses began protesting, accusing the college administration of negligence in the matter.A large number of students, including girls, set fire to college furniture and chanted slogans against the administration. As the protests escalated, with students blocking roads, the police resorted to baton charges to disperse the demonstrators.""During the clash, at least 28 students, including girls, were injured. One student's condition is critical,"" a Rescue 1122 official said, adding that the injured students are receiving treatment at Services Hospital.Sharaz Abbas, a student at Punjab College, told PTI that they were protesting to demand justice for the victim.""The Punjab police brutally assaulted us both inside and outside the campus. Even the girl students were not spared,"" he said, adding that the students would continue their protests until justice is served for the victim.A list of 28 injured students shows that their age ranges between 16 and 25.Talking to reporters, senior police officer Faisal Kamran said the police were forced to use batons. He said the students were demanding the custody of the college principal, and had the police not intervened in time, the protesting students might have harmed the principal and other staff members.Kamran also confirmed that the suspect has been arrested, but noted that the victim or her family is yet to report the incident.""So far, the claims related to the alleged rape have not been verified, but an investigation is underway,"" he said.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said no formal rape report has been filed with the college.""Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz is closely monitoring the situation. Instead of politicising the plight of innocent girls, we urge anyone with verified information or knowledge of the victim to share it with the Punjab government,"" the minister said.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: At least 11 people have been killed and eight more have sustained injuries in a clash between two tribes in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported.Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident between rival tribes in the northwestern part of the country.However, the reason for the clashes is not known.As the violence spread, vehicles were targeted in different areas of the district which led to many more casualties, as noted by senior official Javedullah Khan.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known to be home to over 40 million people who come from various tribal groups and identities.Khan said the injured were taken to a hospital, and efforts were being made to secure travel routes and restore normalcy. The injured were taken to a hospital.Pir Haider Ali Shah, a former parliamentarian and member of a tribal council, said elders had arrived in Kurram to mediate a peace agreement between the tribes.""The recent firing incidents are regrettable and have hampered efforts for lasting peace,"" he said.Notably, tribal group meetings also known as 'Jirgas' are routinely held to ensure peace and stability in the region, as reported by Al Jazeera.In another incident last month, at least 25 people were killed in days of clashes between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both communities live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, according to Al Jazeera.Clashes in the area have seen an uptick as last month alone over 20 people were killed between armed Shia and Sunni Muslims over a land dispute.Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shia Muslims dominate in parts of the district, Al Jazeera noted.Meanwhile, on Saturday, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for attacks at a coal mine in Balochistan which saw the death of over 20 individuals including Pakistani as well as Afghan nationals. The attack had involved the use of heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades.Such attacks have become common in Balochistan, the southern part of the country known to be home to key natural resources but whose benefits do not translate to uplifting the citizens' quality of life there.The outfits operating from Balochistan accuse the central government in Islamabad of exploiting the province's rich oil and mineral resources to the detriment of the local population in the country's largest and least-populated province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.These groups have also expressed their anger against foreign nationals coming in for resource extraction but deriving profits without benefiting the locals. Attacks on international convoys have thus become a key way for citizens to register protests.BLA gave a higher casualty figure of 30 dead and 18 injured in the incident. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan has been a hotbed of armed movements, with the BLA most prominent among them.Last week, the BLA - designated a ""terrorist group"" by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States - claimed responsibility for an attack targeting Chinese nationals near Pakistan's largest airport, Al Jazeera reported.The Chinese embassy in Pakistan said at least two of its citizens were killed and a third injured after their convoy was targeted with an improvised explosive device believed to have been detonated by a suicide bomber.At least 10 people were injured in total, with four cars destroyed in the explosion and 10 more vehicles damaged in the resulting fire, local media reported.",Tensions rose in the Kurram district of the province after two people were critically injured in a shooting incident.

The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO.

The mystery of Irvine , who vanished into clouds as mist swept over the Himalayan Summit, was finally solved after 100 years when the National Geographic team spotted a boot melting out of the ice on Mount Everest in September.Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory while attempting to become the first people to climb the world’s highest peak, the National Geographic said in a report.The team of National Geographic, in September, stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. After examining the boot closely, they discovered a sock with ""a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it.""This discovery could provide further clues about the location of the team's personal effects and may help resolve the mystery of whether Irvine and Mallory ever reached the summit, nearly three decades before the first recognised summit by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.His partner Mallory’s remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine’s were unknown.“It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up,” National Geographic documentary director Jimmy Chin said. “A lot of theories have been put out there.” He hopes the discovery helps explain what happened on the mountain in 1924, and brings some closure to Irvine’s relatives who revere him still.“When someone disappears and there’s no evidence of what happened to them, it can be really challenging for families. And just having some definitive information of where Sandy might’ve ended up is certainly [helpful], and also a big clue for the climbing community as to what happened,” he added.Irvine's great-niece, Julie Summers, was moved to tears upon learning of the discovery, stating, ""It tells the whole story about what probably happened.""The Irvine family has offered to share DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains. Irvine was only 22 years old when he went missing on June 8, 1924, during the final ascent to the summit with Mallory, according to National Geographic .Earlier this year, Mallory's final letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University, revealing his doubts about their chances of reaching the summit.Irvine is believed to have been carrying a vest camera, the discovery of which could rewrite mountaineering history. Climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin did not disclose the exact location of the remains to discourage trophy hunters but “it certainly reduces the search area.”","Andrew ""Sandy"" Ivrine disappeared on Everest on June 8 1924 along with his partner George Mallory.
