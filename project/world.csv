Biden: ‘Every reason’ to believe Bibi prolonging war for political survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/biden-every-reason-to-believe-bibi-prolonging-war-for-political-survival/articleshow/110717963.cms,"Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal

‘Israeli air strikes in Syria have killed Iran general’

(With Reuters inputs)

US Prez Joe Biden , asked whether PM Benjamin Netanyahu was prolonging the war in Gaza in an effort to hold on to office, said that he believes “there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion”, lending his voice to something many in his administration have been saying privately for months.His statement came in an interview with Time magazine that was conducted May 28, three days before Biden gave a speech revealing details of what he called an “Israeli plan” to bring about an exchange of hostages and a permanent ceasefire . His decision to describe the Israeli plan in public appeared to be a clear effort to lock in Netanyahu, who didn’t publicly reveal the details and seemed to back away from some of them after Biden’s statement last Friday.Both in Jerusalem and Washington, Netanyahu is widely seen as highly aware that an end to the conflict could easily result in his being swept from office — especially once investigations began into how Israel ignored evidence of the Oct 7 attack that killed 1,200 Israelis, and how slowly Israel’s defence forces responded. Street protests against him have begun to gather momentum again, seven months after the attack. Netan yahu has made clear, both before and after the attacks, that he is against a two-state solution .Tensions between Biden and Netanyahu have been obvious for months, as the Israeli PM has refused American calls for Israel to allow far larger amounts of aid to reach Palestinians, and to come up with a plan to evacuate displaced refugees from Rafah, the current centre of military action. But Biden was careful not to criticise Netanyahu other than to agree that he was clinging to office by prolonging the war.Israeli govt spokesman David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was “outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country” for Biden to make such comments.Meanwhile, the White Hou se said Biden believes the ceasefire deal on the table is the best chance to get hostages out of Gaza and end hostilities. The US will continue to work with Netanyahu to try to get the proposal over finish line, spokesman John Kirby said.Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from Gaza, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday. “Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.Qatar, which alongside the US and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire govt to reach a deal.Israeli air strikes near Aleppo, Syria, in the early hours of Monday killed a general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps who had been deployed to the country as an adviser, according to Iranian media reports. The Iranian was identified as General Saeed Abyar by Tasnim News agency, a media outlet affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.He was believed to be the first Iranian killed by Israel since the two countries nearly went to war in April, after Israel bombed Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus, killing several commanders. Iran retaliated, attacking Israel with a barrage of 300 drones and ballistic missiles, after which Israel attacked an Iranian military base with a missile. Since then, however, the two countries stepped back from direct confrontations, facing intense global pressure to not ignite a new, wider regional war. And Iran is now enmeshed in a domestic leadership crisis, making a new wave of attacks on Israel seem unlikely. Iran has been reeling from the sudden death of Prez Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash two weeks ago.Abyar was a member of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Revolutionary Guards that operates largely in other nations. He had been in Syria since 2012, when he was deployed to help the govt in Damascus fight a civil war with opposition forces and IS terrorists. The Quds Force now uses Syria as a regional headquarters for coordinating and arming militia groups known as the “axis of resistance”, including in Lebanon, Iraq and West Bank.","Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza.

Russia bots target Paris Olympics with deepfake Tom Cruise video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-bots-target-paris-olympics-with-deepfake-tom-cruise-video/articleshow/110718318.cms,"With its athletes barred from competing in the Summer Olympics under the country’s flag, Russia has turned its fury on the Games and this year’s host, Paris.

Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies to issue fake warnings urging people to avoid the Games, according to a report released on Sunday by Microsoft. The report details the disinformation campaign created by a group the company calls Storm-1679. The campaign appears to have accelerated since March, flooding social media with short videos raising alarms about pos sible terrorist attacks and stoking fears about safety. The operation, while aimed at the Games, is using various techniques to spread disinformation that could also be employed in European and US elections.

The work began in earnest last summer with the release of a fake documentary about the International Olympic Committee, expropriating Netflix’s logo and using an artificial-intelligence-powered voice impersonating Tom Cruise . The committee succeeded in having the video titled “Olympics Has Fallen” — a spoof of the 2013 film “Olympus Has Fallen” — removed from YouTube. The attacks have continued, though, with persistent efforts to discredit its leadership, the committee said in March, citing a campaign that used fake recordings of what purported to be telephone calls by officials of the African Union on behalf of Russia.

Storm-1679 now appears to be making shorter videos that are easier to create. It used to focus on disparaging Ukrainian refugees in the West, but after French Prez Macron began to publicly consider sending French troops to Ukraine, it shifted to the Olympics. Microsoft estimates that Storm-1679 produces three to eight faked videos a week, in English and French, with many impersonating the BBC, Al Jazeera and other broadcasters. The group appears to respond quickly to news events, su ch as protests in New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific. Others focus on the prospect of a terror attack in Paris.

Most of the videos pretending to be from CIA and French intelligence are relatively simple. They are unlike anything CIA has actually produced, but to unsuspecting readers online, they could appear legitimate, using the agency’s logo and stark white-on-black typography. “They are trying to cultivate an anticipation of violence,” Clint Watts of Microsoft, said of the group Storm-1679. “They want people to be fearful of going to the Olympics.” French officials and Microsoft say one of the group’s tactics appears to be trying to get the attention of factcheckers. “The content doesn’t normally travel from one platform to another, but when their false content is fact-checked by accounts with a large following, the content gets far more views and in front of new and different audiences,” Watts said","Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies.

Aus military to recruit non-citizens in a bid to boost troop numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/aus-military-to-recruit-non-citizens-in-a-bid-to-boost-troop-numbers/articleshow/110718226.cms,"MELBOURNE: The Australian military will begin recruiting some non-citizens in a bid to boost troop numbers , the govt said Tuesday. Only people from other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership who hold Australian permanent residency will be eligible.

The move is part of a push to build a military that can resist foreign coercion through blocked trade routes in the future, defence minister Richard Marles said. Marles, who is also deputy PM, said the change was a major step toward addressing a 4,400-person shortfall in the Australian Defence Force , whose target strength is 63,600 fulltime personnel.

The govt intends to increase that number to 80,000 by 2040. Relatively low unemployment is one of the factors working against the Australian military attracting and retaining personnel.

Australia is particularly reliant on open sea and air routes as an island nation that trades with the world and is therefore suspectable to coercion from foreign militaries, Marles said. “We are not trying to make ourselves a peer of the US or of China,” Marles told delegates at a securi ty conference. “That’s not a credible thing to propose.” “In a far less certain world, do we have an ability to be able to resist coercion of any adversary and to make our way?” he added.

New Zealanders who have lived in Australia for at least a year will be eligible to join the military from July, and permanent residents from the US, Britain and Canada will be eligible from Jan 2025.",Australian military will begin recruiting some non-citizens in a bid to boost troop numbers.

Imran Khan posts with ‘fall of Dhaka’ parallels rile army,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-posts-with-fall-of-dhaka-parallels-rile-army/articleshow/110645640.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The tussle between Pakistan ’s most popular politician, jailed ex-PM Imran Khan , and the head of its most powerful institution, Army Chief General Asim Munir , has intensified after the former owned up anti-military posts in which the country’s current political situation was compared to the 1971 fall of Dhaka .The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account with a video comparing the past and present military leaderships and a statement urging people to study a judicial commission report on Pakistan’s breakup. The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

He also expressed uncertainty about whether Israeli forces had committed war crimes in Gaza, rejecting claims that Israel was using starvation as a warfare tactic, but stating, ""I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.""The Israeli government spokesperson, David Mencer, criticized Biden's remarks about Netanyahu, calling them ""outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country."" Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his defense chief, and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.Israel launched an offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas after it attacked inside Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the capture of more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli assault has claimed the lives of over 36,000 people in Gaza, as reported by local health authorities, who also state that thousands more bodies remain buried under rubble.Despite most Israelis supporting the war, opinion polls indicate that they hold Netanyahu responsible for the security failures during the Hamas attack on Israeli communities near Gaza on October 7. The polls also suggest that if an election were held, Netanyahu would be voted out of office.

"Biden takes a big swing at hostage-for-truce deal, puts onus on Israeli, Hamas officials to step up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-takes-a-big-swing-at-hostage-for-truce-deal-puts-onus-on-israeli-hamas-officials-to-step-up/articleshow/110684865.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is looking past resistance from key Israeli officials as he presses Israel and Hamas to agree to a three-phase agreement that could immediately bring home dozens of Israeli hostages, free Palestinian prisoners and perhaps even lead to an endgame in the nearly eight-month-old Gaza war.Biden's big swing - during a tough reelection battle - could also demonstrate to a significant slice of his political base demoralized by his handling of the conflict that he's doing his part to end the war that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands struggling to meet basic needs.White House officials on Monday said Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal - just one day after it was delivered to Hamas - was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot. The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.""The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.Almost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal - which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.Netanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain ""gaps"" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis ""reserve the right to return to war.""Kirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he ""expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.""""This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,"" Kirby said. ""This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.""But even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition - National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.Smotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is ""the only language understood in the Middle East.""Netanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages - officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others - to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.Even as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.""They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,"" Sullivan said in an appearance at the US Global Leadership Conference in Washington.To that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was ""the best possible opportunity for an agreement,"" the White House said.Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the United Nations, said the US circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.Sullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.Group of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.""We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,"" the G7 leaders said in a statement.Biden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.The first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.The Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.Hamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one - and the six-week pause in fighting - would bring about a ""downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.""""I'm not sure they can expect much more,"" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.""Indeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.Just last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.But with Election Day in the US now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.",White House officials say Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot.

White bike installations pop up across New York as reminder of road safety,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-bike-installations-pop-up-across-new-york-as-reminder-of-road-safety/articleshow/110684638.cms,"On a chilly Saturday evening in April, Kevin Daloia took a bicycle that he had painted white and locked it to a pole on East 161st Street and Melrose Avenue in the Bronx. Then he climbed up, stood on the seat of the bike and mounted a metal sign on the pole above it. “Cyclist Killed Here/Rest In Peace,” the sign said.The cyclist , Thierno Balde, was hit by a car on Feb 23 while on his way home from prayers at his mosque. The driver fled after the crash and then ditched a crumpled Jeep Grand Cherokee a few blocks away, according to repo rts. The police said Balde had run a red light. But the authorities also said the driver had been speeding. Daloia didn’t know Balde, but that didn’t matter.In his free time, Daloia volunteers to paint old bicycles and fasten them to poles as “ghost bikes” for the New York City Street Memorial Project, which consists of installations around the city marking locations where cyclists have died. The bikes — completely white, including tires, spokes and pedals — serve as stark memorials, both an alert to passers-by that a cyclist was killed and a re minder of the dangerous conditions cyclists face in New York. The activistshope to catch the attention of drivers as well.Daloia isn’t sure how many, exactly, he has erected. “I’ve done this for a long time,” he said. “Anything in the Bronx I’ve touched, and I’ve touched a lot more throughout the city. I don’t know the number, man. Probably 20, 25?” Last year was the deadliest for cyclists in New York since 1999. Thirty cyclists were killed in 2023, according to the city’s department of transportation. Of those, 23 were riding e-bikes. Most fatalities oc curred in collisions with cars and trucks — on streets that did not have dedicated bike lanes.In New York, a group of artists called Visual Resistance first put up ghost bikes in 2005 in response to a couple of cyclist deaths. “It was supposed to speak more powerfully than words,” said Leah Todd, another volunteer. “A silent but very communicative memorial.” The idea caught on and continues to gain momentum. “We had some grand idea and hope that people would want to care — and want to limit these deaths.”Ghost bike volunteers recei ve donated bicycles from bike shops, friends or word of mouth. They remove a few essential parts from each bike, rendering it un-ridable and therefore less likely to be stolen. Although cyclist fatalities are usually caused by car crashes, the volunteers who install ghost bikes are not necessarily anti-car. Daloia describes himself as “a cycling traffic safety advocate who starts his car every day”. He believes cars, people and bicycles should be able to coexist peacefully. “I want some of the roads around here to be safer for pedestrians and cyclists.”","Last year was the deadliest for cyclists in New York since 1999.

Senior White House officials have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout.Biden has been deliberating for months to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed at the behest of Republicans, who defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico .","President Joe Biden is preparing to sign off on an executive order that would shut down asylum requests to the US-Mexico border. The order would close the border once the number of daily encounters hits 2,500 between ports of entry, with the border reopening once that number declines to 1,500. Biden is expected to unveil his actions at the White House on Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110684374,imgsize-27996,width-400,resizemode-4/110684374.jpg"

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California. First Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US district Judge Maryellen Noreika. “Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House.Hunter’s trial gives Republicans a chance to shift atten-tion away from Trump’s legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.In the case brought by US special counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last Sept Hunter was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in Oct 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter faces up to 25 years in jail, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the justice department.Noreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving length of the trial, likely to run through end of next week.","Hunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president.

'Vicious' atmosphere

LONDON: Stormy Daniels , the adult film actor, broke her silence after former US president Donald Trump 's conviction to say he should be jailed, in an interview published in British tabloid The Mirror at the weekend.""I think he should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate, or being the volunteer punching bag at a women's shelter,"" Daniels said in the interview, published late on Saturday.A jury of 12 New Yorkers on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts of business fraud for trying to cover up hush money payments to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election .Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 to keep silent and prevent scandal from breaking ahead of the election, in which Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton After years of exchanging insults with Trump on social media, Daniels now says she finally has been ""vindicated"", although she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury made a decision -- one that made Trump the first ever former US president to be convicted of a crime.Daniels also accused the White House hopeful of being ""completely and utterly out of touch with reality"" and compared him to a child at one point in the interview.The former adult film actor and director helped bring Trump down in court with her gripping testimony, which included graphic descriptions of what she says was a casual sexual encounter in 2006.""Being in court was so intimidating with the jurors looking at you,"" she said in the Mirror interview, adding that she was glad it was proved that she had been ""telling the truth the entire time"".""It's not over for me. It's never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.""The 45-year-old had remained uncharacteristically quiet in the days following the Thursday conviction.Daniels's husband Barrett Blade had previously told CNN that she was ""still processing"" the trial. He suggested that she could be threatened by Trump 's supporters.""You know, all the MAGA idiots are going to be coming after her,"" Blade said, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again movement.Daniels also said she would never escape death threats from Trump's supporters, the Mirror reported.""It's so vicious and threatening... from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do,"" Daniels's lawyer Clark Brewster said of the atmosphere around the trial in an interview with a local ABC News channel.Daniels is a self-made woman who rose from a difficult childhood and through the challenging world of adult movies to become a successful businesswoman.But in a recent documentary, she revealed that behind her outwardly tough, humorous persona on social media, she has been hurt by the constant insults from Trump and his supporters.""Back in 2018 that was stuff like 'liar', 'slut', 'gold digger',"" she said in the film, ""Stormy"".""This time around, it is very different. It is direct threats, it is, 'I'm going to come to your house and slit your throat', 'your daughter should be euthanised'.""The trial and its revelations have added to tensions in the already bitterly divided country.On Friday, Trump launched into a stream of insults and non-factual claims, lashing out that the trial and the judge who presided over it.His campaign on Friday said that it had raised nearly $53 million in online donations after the conviction, boasting that the verdict had boosted his support ""like never before"".Trump is due for sentencing on July 11 but is expected to appeal the verdict.

Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets.

We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live.

The Financial Times reported Friday that Jon Benjamin was traveling in Sinaloa and Durango, two states in northern Mexico where drug cartels have a significant presence, when the incident occurred. The video posted on the social media platform X shows a man who looks like Benjamin seated in the front seat of a vehicle, when he picks up the supposed rifle and points it at someone in the back seat. The five-second clip was posted by an anonymous user along with the message, “In a context of daily killings in Mexico by drug dealers, he dares to joke.”

While the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office hasn't officially announced any changes at the embassy in Mexico City, the FCDO website no longer lists Benjamin as ambassador.

“We are aware of this incident and have taken appropriate action,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement released in response to questions about the reported incident. “Where internal issues do arise the FCDO has robust HR processes to address them.”

UK parliament dissolved ahead of general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-dissolved-ahead-of-general-election/articleshow/110546979.cms,"The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.The election is expected to bring the Labour party back to power after 14 years of Conservative rule. As the clock struck one minute past midnight, all 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant, marking the official commencement of the electoral process.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's election announcement, which took place amidst a heavy downpour, has been seen by many as a shaky start to the campaign, with some interpreting the rain as an ill omen.Sunak's decision to hold the election on July 4, earlier than anticipated, is viewed as an attempt to regain momentum as his party's popularity wanes in opinion polls. Meanwhile, the Labour party, led by former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer, is poised to capitalize on the opportunity to regain power after 14 years in opposition.The ruling Conservative party is not only trailing significantly behind Labour in the polls but also facing a mass exodus of parliamentarians. An unprecedented 129 MPs, including 77 Conservatives, have announced their decision not to seek re-election, reflecting the bleak prospects of victory for the governing party. Some Tory MPs have expressed frustration at being caught off guard by the July election date, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker opting to continue his vacation in Greece while preparing his campaign remotely.Despite Sunak's efforts to promote the Conservatives as the ""safe"" option during his campaign travels across the country, his campaign has encountered some early setbacks. A visit to the site where the Titanic was built drew comparisons between his leadership and captaining a sinking ship. Sunak's campaign has focused on appealing to older voters and right-wing supporters, with pledges to bring back national service and a substantial tax break for pensioners. However, these efforts have done little to boost the party's favor, with polls indicating a significant lead for Labour.Labour, on the other hand, is aiming to capitalize on the public's fatigue with the Conservatives, who have seen five prime ministers since 2016, along with numerous scandals and economic challenges. The party has sought to position itself as the ""natural party of business,"" garnering the support of 120 industry leaders this week. Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, Labour has shifted towards the center in an attempt to win back voters, including by expelling former leader Jeremy Corbyn and taking steps to address anti-Semitism within the party.However, the past week has also exposed long-standing factional divisions within Labour, with MP Diane Abbott expressing dismay at the party's desire to bar her from candidacy. Starmer has faced criticism from leftist voters who accuse him of backtracking on promises made during his successful leadership campaign. As the campaign progresses, both parties will need to navigate internal challenges while presenting a compelling vision to the electorate.(With AFP inputs)","The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.
