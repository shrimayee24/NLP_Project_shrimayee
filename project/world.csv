'Undermining our region’s stability': PDP slams Omar Abdullah for calling to scrap Indus Waters Treaty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/undermining-our-regions-stability-pdp-slams-omar-abdullah-for-calling-to-scrap-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/121244189.cms,"Omar Abdullah (left), and Mehbooba Mufti

NEW DELHI: The People's Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday criticised Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah for his recent comments about the Tulbul Navigation Project and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). The party said such remarks could affect the ""fragile"" peace and ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC).""Omar Abdullah’s remarks invoking the Tulbul Navigation Project and the control of water flow across the border are not just ill-timed but deeply irresponsible. At a moment when peace is fragile and the ceasefire is barely holding, such provocations only serve to inflame tensions,"" the PDP said in an official statement.The PDP also referred to a 2002 resolution on the IWT in the Jammu and Kashmir legislative council. It said, ""The resolution was moved by an NC MLC, not the PDP. It passed solely because the National Conference held a majority in the Upper House.""This response followed a recent exchange between Omar Abdullah and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. The two leaders commented on the possible resumption of the Tulbul Navigation Project after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.The argument began when Abdullah posted on Thursday about restarting construction on the Tulbul Navigation Barrage at Wullar Lake. He wrote, ""The Wular lake in North Kashmir. The civil works you see in the video is the Tulbul Navigation Barrage. It was started in the early 1980s but had to be abandoned under pressure from Pakistan citing the Indus Water Treaty. Now that the IWT has been 'temporarily suspended' I wonder if we will be able to resume the project,"" on his X handle.Mufti shared Abdullah's post and replied, ""At a time when both nations have just stepped back from the brink of war—with Jammu and Kashmir once again paying the highest price through loss of innocent lives, destruction, and suffering—such provocative statements are deeply irresponsible.""Meanwhile, the PDP in its official statement described Abdullah’s comments on the IWT as ""dangerous and short-sighted."" It said such remarks could raise tensions and harm people especially in border areas.""Our position is clear: We continue to demand fair compensation under the treaty to Jammu and Kashmir, but the IWT must not be used as a pretext for war rhetoric,"" the PDP said.The party also said, ""Introducing contentious issues like the Tulbul Project or the abrogation of the IWT in today’s volatile climate only pushes both countries closer to further confrontation. Those in J&K advocating such positions are undermining our region’s stability, jeopardizing the lives of our people living in the border states who suffer most when conflict escalates, and, most importantly, India’s interests.""","The party said such remarks could affect the ""fragile"" peace and ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) This response followed a recent exchange between Omar Abdullah and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. The two leaders commented on the possible resumption of the Tulbul Navigation Project.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121244202,imgsize-1199276,width-400,resizemode-4/erf-5.jpg"

BIJNOR: A 30-year-old constable died while attempting to rescue suspects after a high-speed chase ended with the criminals’ vehicle plunging into a canal near Bijnor city, reports Harveer Dabas.Despite suffering a electric shock upon entering the water, unknowingly electrified by live wires that had snapped during the crash, the constable managed to alert his colleagues to the danger, preventing further casualties, police said on Saturday.Officers said the suspects were celebrating the release of a friend from jail and were driving recklessly when they collided with a truck. Villagers alerted the police when the group assaulted the truck driver and fired at him.Bijnor SP Abhishek Jha said, “A police response vehicle and local units responded immediately, initiating a high-octane chase. The suspects’ vehicle sped along the Salmabad-Bharera road before crashing into a high-tension electric pole and plunging into a nearby canal, snapping the power wires that fell into the water.”He added, “Constable Manoj Kumar and head constable Gangaram dove into the canal to arrest the suspects. They didn’t know the water was electrified. The power supply was cut immediately, and the officers were pulled out and rushed to a hospital. Kumar, a native of Haiba village in Baghpat district, succumbed to his injuries while Gangaram remains hospitalised.”Praising the constable’s bravery, Jha said, “Manoj didn’t just risk his life but also saved six of his fellow officers. Even while suffering shock, he managed to alert them. His final act was one of true bravery.” Manoj joined the force in 2016. He is survived by his 28-year-old wife and their five-year-old son. On Saturday, officers from across the district gathered to honour him with a full police funeral.Meanwhile, police arrested one of the suspects, Neeraj Kumar — a history-sheeter with a prior attempt to murder charge — at the scene. Another accused, Veerbhan alias Veeru from Moradabad, was nabbed after a brief encounter.A country-made pistol, a live round and a spent cartridge were recovered from the spot. Two suspects are absconding, and legal proceedings are currently underway, officers said.","Constable Manoj Kumar died while attempting to rescue suspects after a high- speed chase ended with the criminals’ vehicle plunging into a canal near Bijnor city.

The inside story of a seamless Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-inside-story-of-a-seamless-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121241911.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the Adampur Air Base in Jalandhar.

Operation Sindoor

Resolute political will

Choice of targets

Closing intel gap

They knew it was coming

Choice of weapons

Air defence held firm

Threat within Pakistan

Missing ‘strategic depth’

Navy, the amplifier

Staying the course

Wars always generated a fog of claims and counter-claims. Did the Americans deliberately target civilians? Did a cynical Saddam Hussein use hospitals and schools as shields? It was always difficult to sift the truth from the lies, but the problem now has become even more acute with that much more information manipulation by the combatants.During Operation Sindoor, the same game played out, but one thing has now become abundantly clear: India won the latest round decisively. Indian armed forces have given enough information, backed by photographs and satellite images, leaving little room for disputes by sceptics and biased pundits masquerading as objective neutral parties. The assertions have been backed by independent military strategists and experts.TOI, based on accounts from multiple high-level insiders, who obviously spoke on the condition of anonymity, pieced together how India executed Operation Sindoor.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy with his engagements in Saudi Arabia when news of the attack on tourists in Pahalgam started trickling in. As soon as the magnitude of the massacre — the sheer monstrosity of the act, the fact that only Hindu men were targeted — was clear, Modi made up his mind that this would not go unpunished.The terrorists had even taunted wailing family members of victims that this was a message to Modi. The PM cut short his visit and on the way back told his colleagues to start preparing for retaliation against terrorists and their patrons.The consultations in the Cabinet Committee on Security and with the defence and intelligence leadership were not about “if” we should retaliate. It was solely focused on “where and when”, sources told TOI. In 2019, Modi had called Pakistan ’s nuclear bluff when he ordered the air strike on the jihadi hub of Balakot in response to the Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy.He was determined not to let that be an obstacle this time around as well despite alarmist predictions about Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir being a jihadi in olives who had a restless finger on the nuclear button. India also factored in that China and Turkiye were standing by Pakistan, that a large number of Indian troops were stationed along the China border, and also that the West was again getting spooked by Pakistan’s scare-mongering. None of this dimmed India’s resolve which was articulated by the PM in Madhubani.The 2016 surgical strikes after the terror attack at an Army camp in Uri signalled the intent not to let the LoC come in the way of India’s pursuit of justice. The govt climbed up a couple of steps in the escalation ladder through the air strike on Balakot — a revered spot in the jihadi imagination.This time, the message had to be stronger and, hence, the selection of Muridke and Bahawalpur, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which had been responsible for almost all the major terror attacks on India, beginning with the audacious one on Parliament in 2001 and including the amphibious army-type assault on Mumbai in 2008. The headquarters of Hizbul Mujahideen and other areas in POK, which were the staging ground for attacks, were part of the ‘to-hit’ list drawn up with the help of meticulous intelligence the govt already had.Forty-odd buildings were priority targets and the objective was to inflict damage that was visible, lethal and served to amplify the message: “We know who you are, where you are and how to get you.gPainstaking intelligence gathering over the past 10 years has helped India take care of what has for decades been a major handicap vis-a-vis its hostile neighbour. The success of Operation Sindoor only served to confirm what had been speculated over the past couple of years: that India has closed the intelligence gap.A combination of humint and techint helped India pin the exact locations, down to the buildings that served as the residential quarters of the leaders of Lashkar and Jaish inside the sprawling complexes at Muridike and Bahawalpur. Ten members of the family of Masood Azhar died. He himself barely escaped an Indian missile. Such was the extent of the losses that the Pakistan army had to depute its senior ranks to attend their funeral: an act of solidarity which blew apart the fiction of jihadi outfits being non-state actors.Uri and Balakot had left little room for doubting the Modi govt’s intent. Right after the Pahalgam attack, speculation was rife that India would target terror hubs, especially the jihadi universities at Muridke and Bahawalpur. It was also certain that Pakistan, caught napping twice, would have ramped up defences around its “prized assets”, thus eliminating the room for India to spring a surprise. Yet, two weeks after the Pahalgam massacre, India decided to hit the very same targets. Sources refused to confirm if it was because our intelligence had signalled that Pakistan had lowered its guard. It certainly created a “bol ke mara, jo kaha so kiya” moment for the govt and the forces.Intelligence also helped India exploit a chink in Pakistan’s air defence. The Rawalpindi GHQ and their Chinese handlers had designed a shield to defeat any attack that involved planes and missiles. But they did not take into account India’s stock of loitering munitions (a type of drone). A deadly addition to the inventory, loitering munitions fly at low altitude to dodge regular air defence, hunt and hover over the target with exact coordinates fed into it, before striking with precision.Over the past few years, India has built an impressive arsenal of the stealth weapon, largely sourced from overseas through the Emergency Purchase route, but now increasingly being produced domestically too. Combined with longrange Made-in-India drones, they took a heavy toll on the nine terror targets. Once they had got the “free hand” from the PM, defence and intelligence officers started working on the execution of Operation Sindoor.What helped them were multiple simulations the three Services had run, enabling near-perfection in the implementation. The four-day operation saw them work together: a perfect example of the muchaspired-for “jointness” that India has sought to achieve in recent years. There is speculation that some of the most ferocious strikes were achieved through weapons fired by Navy personnel.The destruction near Lahore of the HQ-9 missile defence system, a copycat version of the Russian S-300, and a strategic gift from China, marked a major blow to Pakistan, both materially as well as psychologically. But this was only a prelude to the major unravelling of Pakistan’s air defence.Their air bases, including strategic ones, which are home to F-16s and Chinese-made J-10s, and those located next to the headquarters of Strategic Plans Division that handles their nukes, became vulnerable. Open to missile and drone attacks, it exposed the hollowness of Bunyanum Marsoos, the ‘wall of lead’ that Pakistanis had claimed to have built. As against this, India’s own air fortification remained intact.A combination of the legacy antiaircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles, particularly the portable ones, battle-proven Pechoras, indigenously developed Akash, and S-400 that India acquired from Russia in 2018 in defiance of US’s threat of sanctions, turned out to be “the wall”. In another example of jointness, the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and the Army were supplemented by those of the Navy.As a result, all our air bases remained safe and operational. Pakistan’s claims about the destruction of the Adampur air base were proven to be fiction on Tuesday when Modi landed there on his special plane to address the jawans, with S-400 Triumph batteries forming a defiant backdrop. The military success announced India’s fullscale readiness for new-age warfare and will go a long way in enhancing confidence of the armed forces in “Make-in-India” weapons.Pakistan had limited options of widening the theatre of war by opening a front on the land border. With the Baloch insurgency developing into a front within, Gen Asim Munir could have withdrawn the Chaklala-headquartered X Corps — tasked with defending Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir — from Balochistan, but only at a huge risk. Attacks by Balochistan Liberation Army, even during the hostilities with India, only further shrank the space for manoeuvre.The vulnerability of Pakistan’s skies and the high possibility of Baloch snipers aiming at long convoys meant that the 26 division — the mechanised division based in Bahawalpur — could not be brought to the border either.Pakistan had wanted to turn Afghanistan into a client state, hoping that its control over its neighbour would give it strategic depth in any confrontation with a conventionally superior India. The retreat of the US and the installation of a Taliban regime was supposed to be the fulfilment of the dream of the planners at Rawalpindi GHQ.Unfortunately for them, the new regime in Kabul has refused to be pliant and an accessory, leading Islamabad to ironically accuse them of not controlling Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. It has also made it necessary for Pakistan to deploy a sizeable number of its troops in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. Staunch solidarity of the majority in KP with jailed former PM Imran Khan and the fear that his supporters would erupt in the streets against the Pakistan army further tied Islamabad’s hands.It did not join the action as such. But its offensive posture clearly signalled India’s intent and readiness to respond to any escalation. Ships resorted to aggressive manoeuvres on a night when Indian missiles had hit targets in Karachi’s immediate vicinity.The message was that India was more than willing to broaden the theatre to cover all domains, and Pakistan got the message. As Vice Admiral AN Pramod said, the Indian Navy ensured that the enemy’s air force remained “bottled up” on the Makran coast.Stoking the West’s fears of a nuclear conflagration and capitalising on it has for decades been Pakistan’s playbook. The tactic was deployed again and it worked, with Western capitals offering unsolicited counsel to New Delhi to de-escalate. The Modi govt, however, refused to flinch and maintained that terrorists needed to be made accountable and India has the right to defend its citizens. The message, in its most stark form, was conveyed by the PM to US vice-president J D Vance on the evening of May 9. Vance had called to convey “intelligence” about Pakistan planning a massive retaliation.“They can do whatever they are planning to, but India’s response will be even stronger,” Modi is learnt to have told Vance. That Modi really meant “goli ka jawab gole se” became evident in hours. After the IAF humiliated Pakistan by hitting its prized air bases, external affairs minister S Jaishankar got a call from US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Saturday morning, saying that Pakistan was ready to discuss a ceasefire.India’s first response was to escalate the strikes on Pakistan’s air bases before its Director General of Military Operations Lt General Rajiv Ghai decided to connect with his counterpart Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah. The biggest takeaway for Pakistan and the world at large: Since the global community is unable or unwilling to force Pakistan to change its behaviour, India is ready to execute the task on its own, despite significant risks. And it is sure the people will back a govt that is ready to go to the farthest lengths.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy with his engagements in Saudi Arabia when news of the attack on tourists in Pahalgam started trickling in.

BJP: Sharif words prove Op Sindoor’s boldness

NEW DELHI: In a first formal acknowledgment, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has confirmed that the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi was struck during the night of May 9–10, when India carried out missile strikes on multiple Pakistani airbases. This admission is significant as it corrects the narrative surrounding the cross-border hostilities, as previous Pakistani statements had either downplayed or denied the extent of the damage inflicted during the Indian operation.“On the night of May 9 and May 10, at around 2.30 am the Army chief called me from a secure line call that India, through its ballistic missiles had attacked us. One missile hit the Nur Khan airbase and some others have hit other areas,” Sharif said.The Pakistan PM made this statement during his speech at a ceremony titled ‘Youm-e-Tashakur’ (Thanksgiving) on what Islamabad claims is a “sham celebration” on the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-e-Haq against India. During the ceremony in Islamabad, he detailed the chain of events that triggered Islamabad’s response to India. And while he summarised the events, he conceded and established the Indian claim that Nur Khan airbase was hit with Indian missile strikes .Reacting to Sharif’s admission, BJP on Saturday reasserted that it was a confirmation about scale, precision and boldness of Operation Sindoor. “Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif himself admits that General Asim Munir called him at 2.30am to inform him that India had bombed Nur Khan Air Base and several other locations. Let that sink in — the Prime Minister was woken up in the middle of the night with news of strikes deep inside Pakistan. This speaks volumes about the scale, precision, and boldness of Operation Sindoor ,” BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said in a post on X.Sharif also added that Army Chief General Asim Munir asked for permission to respond to India will full force, which later translated into an attack by Pakistan through drones, airstrikes and missile strikes, which were successfully thwarted by Indian armed forces","Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has confirmed that the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi was struck during the night of May 9–10, when India carried out missile strikes on multiple Pakistani airbases.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is once again under BJP fire. And once again, the ammunition for this all-out attack has been provided by a party leader. P Chidambaram 's reality check on the future of INDIA bloc has left the Congress scurrying for cover.""The future (of INDIA bloc) is not so bright, as Mritunjay Singh Yadav said. He seems to feel that the alliance is still intact, but I am not sure. It is only Salman (Khurshid) who can answer because he was part of the negotiating team for the INDIA bloc. If the alliance is totally intact, I will be very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed,"" Chidambaram said at a book launch in the national capital on Thursday.He also hoped that the alliance can ""still be put together, there's still time"".The BJP, as expected, latched on to Chidambaram's remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. And why not? After all, the leadership of opposition's INDIA bloc is with the grand-old-party and Mallikarjun Kharge is its chairperson. So, Chidambaram's assessment points to failure of the Congress leadership to lead the opposition coalition effectively.Ironically, his remarks come at a time when the Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies during the India-Pakistan standoff. Several BJP leaders cited Tharoor's remarks praising several government's policies, including the ceasefire decision, to slam and school the Congress leadership.It was only yesterday that Congress leader Jairam Ramesh officially announced that Tharoor's remarks were his personal views. ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it is his view and it is not the stand of the party,"" Jairam Ramesh had said yesterday. Some reports citing Congress sources had suggested that the party had expressed displeasure with Tharoor's statements and was of the view that the Thiruvananthapuram MP had crossed the Lakshman Rekha this time around. However, Tharoor had dismissed these reports and called them ""media creation without any evidence.""Chidambaram's statement coming in this backdrop put the party once again on the backfoot.Citing Chidambaram's reality check, the BJP and its allies have been relentless in targeting the Congress and the INDIA bloc calling it a ""greed-driven coalition"", ""Maha-thagbandhan"", ""opportunistic alliance"", ""kushti-dosti model"", ""company of looters"", ""group of corrupt leaders"", ""ghamandiya alliance"". Some even raised questions on Congress's leadership role and claimed that the grand-old-party is fading and has no future.INDIA bloc, which was launched with a lot of fanfare, is actually gasping for breath today and to that extent Chidambaram is spot on in his assessment. But to announce that from a public platform definetely helps party's political rivals - the BJP in this case.It will be interesting to see how the Congress reacts to this new challenge. Party leader Udit Raj, who had slammed Tharoor for 'becoming BJP's spokesperson', had a word of advice for Chidambaram. ""Party has given him a lot. He and his son are MPs. Since the party is not in power, Chidambaram ji should go around the country and conduct a dialogue,"" he said.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the party for some time now, but Chidambaram's remarks may have come as a surprise. Interestingly, last week when BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal had slammed the Congress over demand to sack Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial statement on Col Sofia Qureshi, he had cited both Tharoor and Chidambaram to prove his point.""If people start giving resignation for statements, then no one would be left in the Congress except for P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor. We should first demand Rahul Gandhi's resignation,"" the BJP general secretary had said. The fact that both these leaders have put Congress in a spot of bother may be a matter of coincidence. Perhaps.",Congress leader P Chidambaram says the future of INDIA bloc is not so bright. BJP has latched on to the remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121217659,imgsize-1338250,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Espionage case: Arrested Haryana YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra linked to expelled Pakistani official - 10 points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/espionage-case-arrested-haryana-youtuber-jyoti-malhotra-linked-to-expelled-pakistani-official-10-points/articleshow/121237184.cms,"Image credit: Jyoti Malhotra's Instagram

Here are ten key points regarding the case:



Jyoti, who runs a YouTube channel with 3,77,000 subscribers, is accused of communicating with a Pakistani employee at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi. On May 13, India expelled that Pakistani official on charges of espionage. The police said that she maintained contact with Pakistani handlers and allegedly transmitted sensitive information through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Snapchat. She made contact with Ehsan-ur-Rahim, also known as Danish, at the Pakistan high commission in 2023 while applying for a visa to visit the neighboring country, according to the FIR. She met Danish multiple times at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi and was reportedly in contact with Pakistani intelligence operatives, the FIR said. She traveled to Pakistan twice, met Danish’s acquaintance Ali Ahwan, who arranged her stay there. Ahwan also facilitated her meetings with Pakistani security and intelligence officials, including Shakir and Rana Shahbaz. To avoid raising suspicion, Jyoti saved Shahbaz’s mobile number under the name ‘Jatt Randhawa.’ A photo posted by Jyoti Malhotra on March 22, 2025, showed her alongside two other Indian YouTubers, with a caption claiming they were at the Pakistan high commission. According to police, Jyoti admitted to sharing sensitive information with Pakistani intelligence operatives and disguising their contacts with misleading names to evade detection. Officials said that her sustained communication with these operatives constitutes a violation of the Official Secrets Act and poses a serious threat to national security. She has been charged under applicable provisions of the Official Secrets Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita by Civil Lines police in Hisar. She was arrested just a day after a 25-year-old postgraduate student, suspected of connections with Pakistani intelligence operatives, was taken into custody in Kaithal. Meanwhile, Nauman Ilahi, a 24-year-old from Panipat district, was also arrested on charges of allegedly providing sensitive information to contacts in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Haryana YouTuber and travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra was arrested on Saturday in a case related to spying for Pakistan. She has been accused of sharing sensitive information with an official at Pakistan high commission who was expelled on charges of espionage on May 13.Her YouTube channel, which features a total of 487 videos, includes several documenting her visits to Pakistan, with titles such as “Indian Girl in Pakistan,” “Indian Girl Exploring Lahore,” “Indian Girl at Katas Raj Temple,” and “Indian Girl Rides Luxury Bus in Pakistan.”The arrest comes amid tensions between India and Pakistan over Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22.","Jyoti Malhotra, who runs a YouTube channel with 3,77,000 subscribers, is accused of communicating with a Pakistani employee at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: A video posted by now-arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra - known online as Travel With Jo - has emerged as key evidence of her alleged connections with Pakistani officials.In the clip posted in March last year, filmed during an Iftar dinner at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, Malhotra is seen warmly praising the arrangements, expressing repeated interest in visiting Pakistan, and ""hopefully"" getting a visa.The video also captures Malhotra in conversation with Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, a Pakistan High Commission official. She appears to be well-acquainted with him, referring to previous meetings and speaking comfortably with his wife, suggesting a level of familiarity beyond casual acquaintance.According to investigators, Malhotra initially travelled to Pakistan in 2023 whilst participating in a delegation visit. During her stay, she encountered Danish. After returning to India, she maintained contact with him.Following Ahsan's recommendation, she undertook a second journey where she was introduced to Ali Ahsan, who connected her with operatives from Pakistan's intelligence services. Officials indicate that she subsequently began transmitting classified information to these contacts.Jyoti Malhotra is a 33-year-old travel content creator from Hisar, Haryana, who gained popularity through her YouTube channel Travel With Jo, which has over 377,000 subscribers. Her content typically features international travel vlogs, including several videos from Pakistan — the most recent of which was uploaded just last month. Branding herself as a cultural ambassador, Malhotra often portrayed a message of cross-border harmony in her videos.However, this public image has now come under scrutiny following her arrest on Saturday for allegedly spying for Pakistan. According to authorities, Malhotra violated the Official Secrets Act by sharing sensitive information with Pakistani intelligence handlers, posing a threat to India’s national security.She is currently in police custody as further investigations continue.","Jyoti Malhotra is a 33-year-old travel content creator from Hisar, Haryana.

‘CCTV footage clearly shows how accused hit motorbike’

BENGALURU: A tiff over something as trivial as buying cigarettes triggered a road rage that led to the death of a software engineer in Bengaluru recently. One of his associates, also a techie, was injured after their bike was hit from behind by an SUV.Minutes before ramming the bike with his Creta, sales executive Prateek R (31) had been locked in heated arguments with Chetan (30) and Sanjay H N (29). Prateek had allegedly ordered the duo — total strangers — to buy him cigarettes from a pushcart as he pulled over on a road early on May 10, leading to the altercation. Both Sanjay and Chetan were injured when the SUV hit their bike, with the former succumbing to grievous head injuries May 13, three days after being hit.Prateek was arrested and booked for attempted murder initially, followed by a murder indictment after Sanjay’s death. “CCTV footage clearly shows how accused rammed into the bike,” DCP Lokesh Jagalasar said. He said the role of Prateek’s wife, who was accompanying him at that time, was also under the lens.Around 4am on May 10, Sanjay and Chetan were smoking and having tea at a roadside pushcart on Vasantapura Main Road when a Creta pulled up near the duo. Prateek shouted: “Get me four-five cigarettes.” Chetan told Prateek to get off and get the cigarettes himself. “Irked, he got off, abused us, and was about to hit me when Sanjay intervened & pushed him away,” Chetan said in his statement to the police.As Sanjay and Chetan hit the road, the SUV came charging from behind and rammed into their bike. Sanjay was shifted to two hospitals before he died, Chetan said.","Software engineer Sanjay H N died after his bike was hit from behind by an SUV.

"Congress livid as govt ignores its list for foreign outreach, picks Tharoor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-livid-as-govt-ignores-its-list-for-foreign-outreach-picks-tharoor/articleshow/121241642.cms,"Congress leader Shashi Thaoor

Sparing before show of unity

For Congress, Tharoor is a nettlesome problem

Tewari’s name in outreach teams list could also be a challenge for Congress

NEW DELHI: On the day the Centre formally announced the composition of seven delegations of MPs to be sent to various countries to articulate India’s stance against terrorism and highlight ‘Operation Sindoor’, a row erupted Saturday over govt ignoring Congress ’s recommendations on who should be included from its ranks and, instead, choosing Shashi Tharoor — whom the party did not name — to head one of the delegations.Angry at the Centre naming Tharoor and not including three of four MPs it had recommended — Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain and Raja Warring — Congress slammed the Modi govt for playing games” on a sensitive issue, and urged it not to politicise the delegations. From Congress’s list, only Anand Sharma has been picked.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said party MPs included “at the instance of the Modi govt will, of course, go with the delegations and make their contributions”. He added, “INC will...not play partisan politics on national security issues, like BJP does.”Having been shocked by the Left the last time when Pinarayi Vijayan returned to office defying the state’s tradition of ejecting incumbent govts, Congress this time would like to consolidate its leaders to be able to put up a serious challenge as the leading opposition. Support for Shashi Tharoor among some UDF allies may also deter Congress.Recent events have been marked by a growing gulf between the restive MP and Congress, and the fresh confrontation could be the point where the party and Tharoor may have to take a call on their relationship — either Congress swallows its pride and accommodates its star MP or the latter chooses to break free. In between, there exists possibility of Tharoor being an isolated member within the party: something that the Thiruvananthapuram MP must have factored in before he justified his praise for ‘Operation Sindoor’ by saying it was patriotic thing to do.On Saturday, no sooner had govt released names of seven MPs leading global outreach on ‘Operation Sindoor’, which included Tharoor, than Congress released its list of four nominees submitted to the govt for the delegations that did not include Tharoor. The Thiruvananthapuram MP, however, went ahead by announcing that he was honoured to be leading the delegation, and that he would “not be found wanting” when summoned in national interest. Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh addressed the development with a jibe, “there is a difference in being in Congress and being of Congress”.It is ironic that the rumblings came barely a month after Tharoor took the central stage at the AICC session in Ahmedabad, where he was the first speaker on the political resolution introduced by Sachin Pilot . But some felt it was not so ironic after all because Tharoor in his brief speech had urged the party to be one of positivity and hope, and of solutions and not just counting problems, in what could be viewed as an advice to be prudent in picking battles against PM Narendra Modi and his party, BJP.If it comes to a breaking point after Tharoor having called his support for the govt decision over the party’s as “national interest”, Congress would be aware that BJP would use it to paint the arch rival in a negative light. Clearly, Congress has a nettlesome problem on its hands.After Shashi Tharoor, Congress may face more challenge if Chandigarh MP Manish Tewari is included in the all-party delegations that are to visit some foreign countries as part of govt’s global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Sources close to Tewari said, “If the MP’s name is included in the all-party delegations, he will surely rise to the occasion to serve his nation and go with the delegation.”Meanwhile, former Union minister Anand Sharma has received a call from govt that he would be in the delegation. He is one of the four names recommended by Congress. Sharma said, “I received a call from minister (Kiren) Rijiju and I have accepted it as the nominee of Congress.”It is learnt that former minister Salman Khurshid is likely to back out if he figures in the final list. The fourth Congress leader that govt contacted, Punjab MP Amar Singh, may also skip. Neither of the four from Congress that govt contacted are in the shortlist that Rahul Gandhi has submitted to Union minister Kiren Rijiju.","For Congress, Tharoor is a nettlesome problem.

He said PM Narendra Modi himself gave the name ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ in honour of the country’s women.He said that before Modi became PM, terrorist attacks used to take place at regular intervals for years. “Terrorists backed by Pakistan routinely killed our soldiers, bombed our cities, and plotted with impunity. No strong response was ever given,” Shah said.“During the tenure of PM Modi, India saw 3 terror attacks backed by Pak — Uri, Pulwama, and Pahalgam. In all three instances, India gave a befitting reply. After Uri, we carried out a surgical strike , after Pulwama, we warned them with an air strike, and after Pahalgam, the terror headquarters were razed to the ground,” said Shah. As per Shah, Army also destroyed 9 camps which were used to train terrorists and to send them into India.","Shah said our armed forces eliminated nearly 100 terrorists, destroyed the headquarters of terror outfits, and also destroyed 15 military air bases.

NEW DELHI: MEA has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi’s allegation that external affairs minister S Jaishankar had “informed” Pakistan about targeting its terror infrastructure as part of Operation Sindoor, calling the Congress neta’s charge “utter misrepresentation of facts”.“We had warned Pakistan at the start — which was clearly during the early phase after Operation Sindoor’s commencement. This is being falsely represented as having occurred before the operation began. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out,” the MEA spokesperson said in reference to Indian Army’s communication to their Pakistani counterparts after the successful strikes on terror hubs deep inside Pakistan.Press Information Bureau’s Fact Check Unit too asserted that the EAM’s remarks were being misrepresented. It said the video circulating on social media had been selectively edited to mislead viewers.Rahul, on X, accused the Modi govt of compromising national security by allegedly notifying Pakistan ahead of Operation Sindoor. Sharing a video of Jaishankar, he wrote: “Informing Pakistan at the start of our attack was a crime. EAM has publicly admitted that GOI did it. Who authorised it? How many aircraft did our air force lose as a result?”The video features Jaishankar stating, “At the start of the operation, we had sent a message to Pakistan, saying, ‘We are striking at terrorist infrastructure and we are not striking at the military.’ So the military has the option of standing out and not interfering in this process. They chose not to take that good advice.”Rahul’s criticism sparked swift rebuttal from the govt. The PIB Fact Check Unit dismissed the interpretation of the minister’s words as “false and fabricated”. It posted on X: “Social media posts quoting EAM @DrSJaishankar are implying that India gave advance information to Pakistan about #OperationSindoor. This is false and fabricated.” The agency further urged users to avoid sharing unverified content during sensitive national security operations.PIB officials clarified that the EAM’s remarks were part of a tactical communication issued during the operation, aimed at emphasising that the Indian Army had targeted only terror infrastructure and deliberately spared Pakistani military assets, which would remain unharmed if Pakistan army chose not to escalate.","MEA has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi’s allegation that external affairs minister S Jaishankar had “informed” Pakistan about targeting its terror infrastructure as part of Operation Sindoor. “We had warned Pakistan at the start — which was clearly during the early phase after Operation.

Justice Trivedi's career recap

Boycott of judge’s farewell not in good taste, says CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai on Friday disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi , the tenth woman judge in the 75-year history of the court.The boycott stemmed from a split decision of an SC bench on punishment to an AoR who had reportedly suppressed material and attempted to mislead the court in a criminal case. While Justice Trivedi had ordered the AoR’s name to be struck off the rolls for a month, her colleague Satish C Sharma had let him off with a warning.During the farewell in the CJI’s courtroom, many advocates, especially women, complimented Justice Bela M Trivedi for a sterling career that exemplified integrity, hard work and protection of institutional dignity.She had joined Ahmedabad City civil court as an additional district and sessions judge in 1995, when her father, too, was a judge in that court. She became an high court judge in 2011 and was appointed as a judge of Supreme Court in Aug 2021.CJI B R Gavai said though Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Kapil Sibal was present, the boycott of farewell of a judge by the two associations was not in good taste. “We deprecate such a stand of SCBA and SC Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA).” CJI’s bench partner Justice A G Masih said, “Good traditions must be followed and respected.”Justice Trivedi, who will retire on June 9, would not be available on the last working day of SC on May 23 prior to the summer break as she has a family wedding in the US. She said it is for the first time that the CJI has broken tradition to invite all her relatives for tea after the ceremonial bench, and dinner.Attorney general R Venkataramani said Justice Trivedi delivered justice while scrupulously adhering to the law. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Justice Trivedi has never attempted to mould relief to suit popular sentiments, which is a rare thing. This needs courage of conviction, courage to displease people. I lost most of the matters before her, as HC or SC judge, but our respect can never depend on the relief we got or refused.”SG Mehta said, “There are certain individuals who feel that ‘my word should be the last word in law’ and that never happened in Justice Trivedi’s court, where the last word was the word of law even if it was at the expense of displeasing some people... Our respect and love for the judge is not contingent upon whether relief is being granted or not.”",CJI B R Gavai disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi.

Mexican Navy Ship CRASHES Into Brooklyn Bridge; Crew Clings To Masts In Panic | NYC | Viral Video





A dramatic scene unfolded in New York City after a Mexican Navy ship collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday while sailing along the East River. As the ship scraped against the underside of the iconic bridge, it caused visible damage to the vessel's mast.This incident prompted emergency response efforts and temporarily halted the vessel's tour. Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said two people died and 19 others sustained injuries after the ship carrying 277 passengers lost power and crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge.""No personnel fell into the water, so it was not necessary to activate rescue operations,"" the statement added.Videos of the incident went viral on social media, where people can be seen left in shock, screaming and backing away from the shore as the ship's towering mast, adorned with a large green, white, and red Mexican flag, hit the bridge.The Mexican Navy confirmed the incident in a statement on X, saying that Cuauhtémoc, a naval academy training vessel, was unable to continue its journey due to the collision. The extent of the damage has not been fully disclosed, but officials said an assessment of the vessel's condition and crew is underway.""The Secretary of the Navy renews its commitment to the safety of personnel, transparency in its operations and excellent training for future officers of the Mexican Armada,"" the navy said in Spanish.Authorities confirmed injuries in the wake of the incident. The New York Fire Department's press desk said that emergency teams were responding.Cuauhtémoc, a 297-foot-long and 40-foot-wide training ship, is a pride of the Mexican Navy and a floating academy for its cadets.

Who is Harjeet Dhadda ? Why was he killed?



My father was not involved in anything criminal, says son







Gurlin Dhadda, the daughter of Brampton-based Harjeet Singh Dhadda, issued a statement after her father was shot several times at a parking lot in Mississauga, Ontario, in what the police called a 'targeted' shooting. Following the shooting, Dhadda was taken to a hospital where he died. Gurlin said his father was a proud Canadian resident since 1997 and worked hard to build a life in Canada, where he had to die -- despite clear signs of danger.Gurlin said her father was receiving repeated threats and extortion calls and there was a possible attack in 2023. All of this was reported to the police but there was no help. ""We begged for protection. But our cries for help went unanswered. The system that was supposed to keep us safe failed him,"" she wrote.Blaming the government for failing to curb extortion and targeted violence, Gurlin wrote that the community is outraged. ""Why are innocent people left defenceless while the threats grow louder? When the authorities fail to protect us, what options do we have?"" the statement read.On Wednesday, the 51-year-old insurance broker and businessman was approached by suspects at the parking lot before noon and was shot.When officers arrived, they said they found Dhadda with ""obvious signs of trauma"".The shooters fled the scene in a stolen black 2018 Dodge Challenger that has been recovered. TOI earlier reported that the Lawrence Bishnoi group claimed responsibility for Dhadda's murder. They said Dhadda was assisting Khalistan Tiger Force chief Arsh Dalla with bail.Dhadda's son Tanveer Singh Dhadda said his father was not involved in anything criminal.

What is the holocaust row over Mamdani?



What is Mamdani's India connection?







New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani , who is also the son of famous filmmaker Mira Nair, has recently been at the centre of controversies over the Holocaust. Now, an old video has surfaced and doing the rounds in which Mamdani is seen leading a protest against the BJP government in India over the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the Ram Temple.""NYC Candidate for Mayor Zohran Mamdani led a mob of protestors in Times Square calling Hindus as bast**ds and heaping abuses upon Lord Rama, who is worshipped by Hindus. A true scumbag,"" the viral video said. In the 2020 video, Mamdani was seen masked because of the pandemic, as all other people in the background were, as well.At that time, Mamdani was the candidate for New York State Assembly district 36 -- the election that he won later. He spoke in fluent Hindi and English in the video and started it with 'Sat Shri Akal ji'. In the background, there were apparently anti-Hindu chants calling Hindus 'basta**s'. He, however, did not speak about religion and only attacked the ruling party in India.As this old video went viral, social media users dug up his old X post before the protest in which he condemned the BJP in India. ""As an Indian Muslim whose family is witnessing the rising tide of fascism in India, I won't be silent.As New Yorkers who are no strangers to the rise of right-wing nationalism at home, none of us should be silent,"" Mamdani wrote at that time.Politico reported that Mamdani declined to sign onto a state Assembly resolution recognizing Israel on the 77th anniversary of its founding, four months after the lawmaker passed on signing a separate resolution condemning the Holocaust.Mamdani reacted to the accusation and issued a statement that his public statements should outweigh his actions on non-binding resolutions. “I have condemned the Holocaust every year. This is something that is very clear to me and every New Yorker, and is something that I’ve made clear mostly in public statements, which is where most New Yorkers are actually engaging with their politics,” Mamdani said.Mamdani's parents were both born in India. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair who married Mahmood Mamdani, an Indian-born Ugandan academic, author. Zohran Kwame Mamdani was born and raised in Kampala, Uganda, moving to New York City with his family at the age of 7. A graduate of the NYC Public School System, he attended the Bronx High School of Science and received a Bachelor’s Degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College. A few years later in 2018, he became naturalized as an American citizen.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is embroiled in fresh controversies.

New Zealand suspends three Maori MPs for 'intimidating' haka protest in Parliament. Here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/new-zealand-suspends-three-maori-mps-for-intimidating-haka-protest-in-parliament-heres-why/articleshow/121203830.cms,"Three Maori MPs face suspension from New Zealand's Parliament over performing a haka to protest the Treaty Principles Bill. The parliamentary privileges committee recommended suspensions for Rawiri Waititi, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, and Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, deeming their actions disruptive and potentially intimidating. This decision has sparked outrage from Te Pati Maori, who view it as a disproportionate punishment for resisting colonial power.

New Zealand's Parliament will debate suspending Māori lawmakers who performed a protest haka





Three Maori MPs from Te Pati Maori are set to be suspended from New Zealand’s Parliament over performing a traditional haka in protest of the controversial Treaty Principles Bill . The parliamentary privileges committee has recommended a 21-day suspension for party co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, and a seven-day suspension for the party’s youngest MP, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke. The move is being described as the harshest punishment ever handed down to elected officials in New Zealand’s legislative history.The haka, which Maipi-Clarke initiated during the bill’s first reading last November, erupted after she was asked whether the party supported the legislation. In a dramatic moment that went viral globally, Maipi-Clarke also tore up a copy of the bill, prompting Speaker Gerry Brownlee to suspend her for 24 hours at the time. The committee has now ruled that the MPs’ actions could have “intimidated” other lawmakers and disrupted the voting process.Committee chair and National Party minister Judith Collins called it “a very serious matter,” describing the protest as unprecedented in her two decades in Parliament. The report also criticised Ngarewa-Packer for allegedly mimicking a gun gesture, which she said was instead a “wiri,” a traditional expression rooted in Maori culture.Collins stressed that the suspensions were intended to show that such conduct was unacceptable and would be treated with “utmost seriousness”.The reaction from Te Pati Maori was swift and defiant. In a social media post, the party said the decision was “the worst punishment handed down EVER in our history,” adding, “When tangata whenua resist, colonial powers reach for maximum penalty.” MP Mariameno Kapa-Kingi described the process as “grossly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted”.The Treaty Principles Bill, tabled by the libertarian ACT Party, aimed to reinterpret the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi—the founding agreement between Maori tribes and the British Crown. Though it was ultimately defeated by 112 votes to 11, it provoked widespread backlash, including a nine-day protest march and demonstrations involving tens of thousands across the country.While the Labour Party agreed that the MPs’ actions amounted to contempt, it considered the penalties too severe, suggesting a one or two-day suspension would have sufficed. The Green Party outright opposed the sanctions, arguing they were disproportionate and would leave Te Pati Maori voters without representation during a key budget session.",Three Maori MPs from Te Pati Maori are set to be suspended from New Zealand’s Parliament.

Political crisis raise stakes in Romania:





Romania is gearing up for a rerun of its presidential elections after the top court annulled the November 2024 elections over fraud and scandal.Romanians will be seeing the competition between George Simon, a pro-Trump nationalist, and Nicusor Dan , a pro-EU centrist. While far-right, pro-Russian independent candidate Călin Georgescu was barred from running amid accusations of vote manipulation, campaign irregularities, receiving funding from non-transparent sources, and alleged Russian interference, claims that Moscow has denied.The outcome could reshape the future of this pro-Brussels country, which shares a border with war-torn Ukraine.It is pertinent to mention that if George Simion wins the rerun, he would become Romania’s first far-right president.Simion emerged as the frontrunner in the first round of Romania’s presidential election on May 4, securing nearly 41 per cent of the vote.George Simion, 38, is a former football hooligan and outspoken admirer of US President Donald Trump. He is campaigning on a nationalist platform with the slogan “Romania First.”Since co-founding the nationalist AUR party six years ago, Simion has emerged as the face of Romania’s growing far-right movement, working to soften his controversial image during his presidential campaign.An outspoken opponent of LGBTQ rights, Simion has also pushed for a constitutional amendment to define marriage strictly as a union between a man and a woman.Simion attended Trump’s presidential inauguration on 20 January. He also wears a cap with the US president’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.” He has openly expressed his ambition to become Romania’s own “MAGA president.”He has vowed to reestablish ties with the United States, if elected.Simion has expressed his desire to form an alliance of like-minded EU countries, following the example of his role models, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose policies he aims to inculcate.Born in Focșani in eastern Romania, near the border with Moldova, he has previously campaigned for the reintegration of Moldova into Romania.He is banned from entering Ukraine and Moldova after calling for parts of their territories to be returned to Romania.While he has condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"" and expressed support for Nato, Simion criticizes the EU’s policies and opposes sending military aid to Ukraine. He has also demanded ""compensation"" for the support Romania has provided so far.Nicusor Dan, 55, a former math prodigy, campaigns on a promise to ""rebuild"" Romania. As one of the EU’s poorest members with significant wealth inequality, the country has been governed by the same group of politicians since the fall of Communism in 1989.He has repeatedly encouraged people to vote, after turnout reached just 53 per cent in the first round poll.As an independent candidate, Dan has expressed strong support for Ukraine and promised to keep Romania on a ""pro-Western"" path. He has urged voters to reject Simion’s ""isolationist"" policies.Born and raised in Brașov County, Transylvania, central Romania, Dan won several international math competitions as a teenager before studying mathematics at the University of Bucharest.After running for Bucharest mayor several times, Dan was finally elected in 2020 and won re-election for a second term in 2024.After leaving the Save Romania Union (USR), the party he founded, he ran as an independent, stating that the party should focus on fighting corruption rather than on civil liberties, including LGBTQ rights.Polls open at 7:00 am (0400 GMT) and close at 9:00 pm, with exit polls released shortly afterward and official results expected later in the evening.""Romanians should go to the polls with confidence; this time, their will and their vote will not be stolen,"" Simion declared on a private TV channel this week, despite repeatedly alleging a risk of ""massive fraud"".Daniela Plesa, 62, a public employee, said she wanted a president ""to promote the interests of the country"", complaining that ""the European Union demands and demands"", as reported by AFP.Last week's unexpected resignation of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu and the collapse of his pro-European coalition—following their candidate’s failure to reach the runoff—have raised the stakes and intensified political tensions.The new president will have the power to appoint a new prime minister, and Simion's nationalist AUR party could join the government after negotiations to form a new parliamentary majority.Beyond deepening societal divisions, the election turmoil has heightened economic uncertainty in the EU’s most indebted country, which continues to struggle with high inflation.","Romania is gearing up for a rerun of its presidential elections after the top court annulled the November 2024 elections over fraud and scandal.

TEHRAN: Iran's president said his country will continue talks with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program but will not withdraw from its rights because of US threats.""We are negotiating, and we will negotiate. We are not after war but we do not fear any threat,"" President Masoud Pezeshkian said during a speech to navy officials broadcast by state television Saturday.""It is not like if they threaten us we will give up our human right and definite rights,"" Pezeshkian said. ""We will not withdraw, we will not easily lose honorable achievements in military, scientific and nuclear"" fields and other areas.The negotiations have reached the ""expert"" level, meaning the sides are trying to reach agreement on the details of a possible deal. But a major sticking point remains Iran's enrichment of uranium, which Tehran insists it must be allowed to do and the Trump administration increasingly insists the Islamic Republic must give up.President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached.Iranian officials increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.Earlier on Friday, Trump said Iran received a proposal during the talks, though he did not elaborate.During his trip to region this week, Trump at nearly every event insisted Iran could not be allowed to obtain a nuclear bomb, something US intelligence agencies assess Tehran is not actively pursuing, though its program is on the cusp of being able to weaponize nuclear material.Mohammad Eslami, the head of Iran's atomic organization, stressed the peaceful nature of the program, saying it is under ""continuous"" monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, state TV reported Saturday.""No country is monitored by the agency like us,"" Eslami said, adding that the agency inspected the country's nuclear facilities more than 450 time in 2024. ""Something about 25% of all the agency inspections"" in the year.Meanwhile, Israel routinely has threatened to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if it feels threatened, further complicating tensions in the Mideast already spiked by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.In his first reaction to Trump's regional visit, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Trump wasn't truthful when he made claims about creating peace through power.""Trump said that he wanted to use power for peace, he lied. He and the US administration used power for massacre in Gaza, for waging wars in any place they could,"" Khamenei said Saturday during a meeting with teachers broadcast on state television.The US has provided Israel with 10-ton bombs to ""drop on Gaza children, hospitals, houses of people in Lebanon and anywhere else when they can,"" Khamenei said.Khamenei, who has the final say on all Iranian state matters, reiterated his traditional stance against Israel.""Definitely, the Zionist regime is the spot of corruption, war, rifts. The Zionist regime that is lethal, dangerous, cancerous tumor should be certainly eradicated, and it will be,"" he said, adding that the US has imposed a pattern on Arab nations under which they cannot endeavor without US support.""Surely this model has failed. With efforts of the regional nations, the US should leave the region, and it will leave,"" Khamenei said.Iran has long considered the US military presence in the region as a threat on its doorstep, especially after Trump pulled the US out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions.","President Masoud Pezeshkian: ""We are not after war but we do not fear any threat"" President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz criticised US President Donald Trump during a commencement address at the University of Minnesota Law School on Saturday, warning graduates that they are stepping into “a genuine emergency” caused by a president who “tramples rights and undermines the rule of law .”Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, used the platform to rally future lawyers against what he described as authoritarian overreach. “Every single day, the president of the United States finds new ways to trample rights and undermine the rule of law,” Walz declared, drawing loud applause from the audience, according to news agency AP.Calling lawyers the “first and last line of defense,” Walz told the crowd, “This is what the crumbling of rule of law looks like in real time. And it’s exactly what the founders of this nation feared: a tyrant, abusing power to persecute scapegoats and enemies.”Citing recent policy moves, Walz condemned Trump’s immigration crackdown, including the deportation of alleged gang members to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison without due process.He also questioned ethical boundaries around Trump’s acceptance of a private jet from the Qatari royal family, both examples he used to illustrate the erosion of democratic norms.Walz also took aim at major law firms he accused of enabling the administration. “Feckless” and “cowardly,” he called them, for offering pro bono services and support to Trump's legal causes. “It’s a flagrant betrayal of the oath they took as lawyers,” he said, urging graduates to refuse employment with such firms.Anticipating criticism for the speech’s political tone, Walz said, “Some would say, ‘Boy, this is getting way too political for a commencement address.’ But I would argue: I wouldn’t be honoring my oath if I didn’t address this head on,” according to CBS News.Walz’s high-profile speech comes as the Democratic Party continues soul-searching following Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential race. As per AP, frustration within the party remains high over perceived failures to counter Trump’s return to power.Walz, seen as a possible 2028 contender, has been making early moves in key primary states alongside other potential candidates like Illinois Gov JB Pritzker, California Gov Gavin Newsom, and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.Pritzker, who is scheduled to headline a Minnesota Democratic dinner in June, made headlines earlier this year when he likened Trump’s rhetoric to the early days of Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Buttigieg drew attention last week in Iowa by urging Democrats to sharpen their messaging and reach out to ideological opponents.Other prominent Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, have continued rallying large crowds nationwide with their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, while Maryland Gov Wes Moore is set to join Walz for campaign stops in South Carolina later this month.The White House responded swiftly. Trump campaign spokesman Harrison Fields pointed to Walz’s leadership during the 2020 protests in Minnesota after the police killing of George Floyd, saying Walz had failed to control unrest.Fields also mocked Walz’s role on the losing Democratic ticket, calling the Harris-Walz campaign “one of the most chaotic administrations in American history.”","Minnesota governor Tim Walz criticised US President Donald Trump during a commencement address at the University of Minnesota Law School.

Several eyewitness accounts capture aftermath of large explosion near Palm Springs, California





A powerful bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others in what the FBI has officially declared an act of terrorism.“This is an intentional act of terrorism,” said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, during a press briefing near the site. He added, “This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we've had in Southern California.”The explosion ripped through downtown Palm Springs around 11 am (local time), blowing out windows across several blocks and collapsing part of the American Reproductive Centers building.Authorities believe the blast originated from a vehicle in or near the clinic’s parking lot. A charred car axle was all that remained at the scene. Davis confirmed the deceased was near the blast but did not release their identity, citing the need to protect the investigation.According to AP, officials believe the person killed may have been the perpetrator.An AK-47-style rifle was also recovered from the site.While the motive remains unclear, Davis said the clinic “was deliberately targeted.” The FBI has not specified whether the act was domestic or international terrorism.Authorities are also investigating whether the explosion was livestreamed.The clinic confirmed that all staff are safe and that its laboratory, which stores embryos and reproductive materials, was not damaged. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients,” Dr Maher Abdallah, who leads the clinic, was quoted as saying by AP.The force of the blast was immense, scattering debris across a five-lane street and damaging nearby buildings, including a liquor store and a hospital. As per The New York Times, one witness said the car parts were “blown clear across four lanes.”Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills assured residents that the bombing was an isolated incident and there was no ongoing threat. However, as a precaution, Planned Parenthood closed 19 centres across Southern California.US attorney general Pam Bondi condemned the attack in a statement posted online, calling it “unforgivable,” and adding, “The Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America.”The Center for Reproductive Rights called the bombing “horrific” and demanded stronger protections for clinics, stating that patients must “feel safe.”Investigators from the FBI, ATF and local agencies remain at the scene, collecting evidence in what could become a landmark terrorism case in California.","A powerful bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, on Saturday, killing one person and injuring at least four others.

What exactly happened on that day?

What Lufthansa flight said?







A Lufthansa aircraft flying from Germany to Spain, was operated without a pilot for 10 minutes in 2024, according to German news agency dpa's Saturday report.This frightening incident happened on February 17, 2024, when one of the pilots lost consciousness in the cockpit, and another captain was off using the bathroom alone in the cockpit.The mid-air saga unfolded when the Airbus A321 -- carrying 199 passengers and six crew members -- was en route from Frankfurt, Germany to Seville, Spain.According to the senior pilot, aged 43, whose name was not mentioned in the report, he left his 38-year-old colleague in charge while visiting the toilet, with approximately 30 minutes of journey time left. He observed that his colleague seemed competent and vigilant before departing.Upon returning after approximately eight minutes, the captain discovered he couldn't enter the cockpit despite multiple attempts with the security code. The situation escalated when his intercom call received no response, New York Post reported.In response to the concerning situation, the captain resorted to using an emergency access code.The first officer regained consciousness shortly afterwards.""Before the emergency access code timer expired, the co-pilot opened the flight deck door manually from the inside,"" according to the report, noting the captain promptly resumed control of the aircraft.""As the co-pilot was pale, sweating and moving strangely, the captain called for assistance from the cabin crew. The co-pilot was given first aid by the crew and a doctor, who was traveling as a passenger and diagnosed a possible heart condition.""The first officer later informed officials about his uncertainty regarding the duration of his unconsciousness.“The loss of consciousness was so sudden that he was unable to warn the other crew members of his incapacitation.”Dpa reported that Lufthansa acknowledged the investigation report and confirmed their flight safety department's separate inquiry, though the results remained undisclosed.The aircraft maintained stable flight conditions due to the engaged autopilot, despite inadvertent control inputs from the unconscious co-pilot. The voice recorder documented unusual sounds within the cockpit, indicating a medical emergency, according to dpa.The captain attempted access using the standard door code five times, which activates a cockpit buzzer for co-pilot response, but was unsuccessful. A cabin crew member attempted to reach the co-pilot via the aircraft's internal communication system.Subsequently, the captain entered an emergency access code for autonomous door operation. However, dpa reported that the unwell co-pilot managed to open the door from inside moments before the automatic override would have activated.The captain subsequently diverted the aircraft to Madrid, where medical personnel attended to the co-pilot at a local hospital.","A Lufthansa aircraft flying from Germany to Spain, was operated without a pilot for 10 minutes in 2024.

‘Are they tapping us along?’: Marco Rubio on Moscow’s intentions after direct talks between Russia-Ukraine stall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/are-they-tapping-us-along-marco-rubio-on-moscows-intentions-after-direct-talks-between-russia-ukraine-stall/articleshow/121243361.cms,"File photo: US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Picture credit: AP)

Secretary Rubio says Trump wants summit with Russia's Putin ""as soon as feasible""





US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Saturday that he remains wary of Russia’s intentions in the Ukraine peace process, warning that Moscow could be “tapping us along” after the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in three years failed to produce a ceasefire.In an interview with CBS News’ Face the Nation airing Sunday, Rubio confirmed he spoke by phone with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to get a readout on Friday’s talks in Istanbul.“They were not a complete waste of time,” he said, but added, “Are they tapping us along? Well, that’s what we’re trying to find out.”The Istanbul meeting ended in under two hours without agreement on a ceasefire, though both sides consented to a prisoner exchange involving 1,000 captives each. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s offer for a face-to-face meeting in Turkey, instead sending a lower-level delegation.Rubio acknowledged the delicate balance between patience and urgency. “On the one hand, we’re trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war… On the other hand, we don’t have time to waste,” he said, stressing that broader global issues also demand attention.He also indicated that progress would likely hinge on a direct Trump-Putin meeting. “The president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as feasible,” he said, noting that preparations for such a summit, including the choice of location and timing, had yet to be finalised. Rubio said the Vatican, which has offered to host peace talks, could be a “comfortable” setting for all parties.The remarks come ahead of a high-stakes Monday, when US President Donald Trump is expected to speak with both Putin and Zelenskyy by phone. “Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end,” Trump wrote on social media.While Trump has continued to project confidence in his ability to broker peace, recent escalations on the ground raise doubts about any imminent breakthrough. On Saturday, a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in Ukraine’s Sumy region killed nine people and wounded several others, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a “deliberate attack on civilians.”Zelenskyy has agreed to Trump’s demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, but Ukrainian officials remain sceptical about the US administration’s shifting approach. “Such inconsistency, illogical steps and lack of strategy undermine US credibility,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, according to the New York Times.Critics argue Trump’s posture risks rewarding Russia’s hardline position while cornering Ukraine into concessions. Mick Ryan, a defence analyst quoted by New York Times, said, “Putin’s primary goal is snuffing out Ukraine’s democracy and culture, denying it agency in its own affairs.”As world leaders gathered in Rome for Pope Leo XIV ’s inaugural Mass, Rubio, attending the ceremony, said the new pope had made a “very generous offer” to host peace talks. In his first blessing, Pope Leo urged all parties to strive for “an authentic, just and lasting peace.”","Secretary Rubio says Trump wants summit with Russia's Putin ""as soon as feasible"" Secretary Rubio confirmed he spoke by phone with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to get a readout on Friday’s talks in Istanbul.

Who is Tiffany Slaton? Woman who survived 24 days lost in Sierra Mountains by living on wild leeks and snow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-tiffany-slaton-woman-who-survived-24-days-lost-in-sierra-mountains-by-living-on-wild-leeks-and-snow/articleshow/121241792.cms,"(Source: X)





A 28-year-old woman from Georgia who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains has stunned authorities and her family with a survival story described as “movie-worthy,"" reports the New York Times. Tiffany Slaton , a travelling dialysis technician and outdoors lover from Jeffersonville, Georgia, has been found safe after surviving 24 days alone in the snowy mountains of California.Slaton's journey began as a short three-day solo camping trip near Shaver and Huntington Lakes, but later turned into a fight for survival that took her more than 40 miles off track, all the way to Vermilion Valley Resort During her time in the wild, Tiffany faced 13 snowstorms, an avalanche, and a serious fall from a cliff. She lost her tent, her bike, and most of her supplies.The journey started on April 20 and soon became very tough. Slaton took her electric bike and camping gear, including two sleeping bags and a tent. Early on, she fell off a cliff and was unconscious for about two hours. When she woke up, she made a splint for one leg and “popped the other knee back into place,” NBC News reports.She had no signal and her phone’s map didn’t work.She tried calling 911 five times, but none went through. At one point, she even asked her phone where the nearest Starbucks was; it said 18 miles away.Her family reported her missing on April 29, and a large-scale search followed, covering roughly 600 square miles. Local authorities and volunteers collectively travelled over 4,000 miles on foot and by vehicle. A helicopter was also deployed, but no trace of her was found until this week.Slaton stayed alive by eating wild leeks and boiling snow for water. She also made tea each day using pine needles and manzanita. To keep herself calm, she wrote in a journal every day.She finally reached Vermilion Valley Resort, hidden deep in the Sierra mountains and often cut off by snow. The cabin she found was unlocked, and the resort owner keeps it that way in case lost hikers need a place to stay.“I thought I had somehow managed to make it to the North Pole,” Slaton said, describing the moment she saw the cabin. Inside, she found a sleeping bag, which she called “the best sleeping bag I had ever seen.”The next day, just before her 28th birthday, the resort owner came. The roads had only just been cleared. “She pops out, didn’t say a word, just ran up, and all she wanted was a hug,” he said. “That’s when I realised who this was.”“She said, ‘Dad, I’m alive, and I’m sorry,’” her father Bobby was quoted as saying to NBC News. “Those prayers were answered.”Fresno County Sheriff John Zanoni called her tale one “they would make movies about.” His colleague Tony Botti added, “She’s a fighter. She’s not going to give up.”","Tiffany Slaton, 28, from Georgia, went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains on April 29.

One person killed in explosion outside fertility clinic; police say act was ‘intentional’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-person-killed-in-explosion-outside-fertility-clinic-police-say-act-was-intentional/articleshow/121242923.cms,"AP photo





The FBI says the explosion that damaged a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, was an “intentional act of terrorism.”Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said Saturday evening that the clinic was deliberately targeted.He declined to elaborate on how authorities have reached a conclusion on a motive.Authorities were still working to confirm the identity of the person who died at the scene. Davis would not directly say whether that person was the suspect but said authorities were not searching for a suspect.Davis also said four people were hurt but provided no additional details on the severity of the injuries.Authorities were also investigating the possibility that the explosion was being livestreamed, Davis said.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.(AP) — An explosion that heavily damaged a fertility clinic Saturday in the upscale California city of Palm Springs was apparently intentional, local authorities said. One person was found dead, and the FBI said it was sending investigators, including bomb technicians, to the scene.Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said in a statement that the blast “appears to be an intentional act of violence” and that several buildings were damaged, some severely.“There has been one fatality, the person’s identity is not known,” Mills said.The act was being investigated as a possible car explosion, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss preliminary information from an ongoing investigation. One of the officials told AP that investigators believe the person who died was likely the person who set off the explosion, but they cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages. Authorities have not disclosed a motive.Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to learn more about the explosion, adding, “Let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable.”The FBI's Los Angeles field office said via the social platform X that “assets being deployed include investigators, bomb technicians & an evidence response team.” Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also assisting.The city of Palm Springs said the explosion happened at 11 a.m. and residents were asked to avoid the area around North Indian Canyon Drive near East Tachevah Drive.Dr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic, confirmed that his facility was damaged. He told AP in a phone interview that all staffers were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients, but the IVF lab and the stored embryos were spared.“I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”Aerial video showed a burned-out car in a parking lot behind the building that housed the fertility clinic’s office space. The blast caved in the roof and blew a wide debris field across a sidewalk and four lanes of the street on the other side of the structure.Rhino Williams, 47, said he was chatting with customers at a restaurant he helps manage inside the Skylark Hotel just over a block away when he heard a huge boom. Everything rattled, Williams said, and he sprinted to the scene to see if anyone was in need of help.Williams saw a large dark gray plume of smoke and covered his nose with his shirt as he smelled burning plastic and rubber. He said he saw a building had “blown out” into the street, with bricks and debris scattered everywhere, and he spotted a car’s front axle on fire in the parking lot.He said it was the only car in the lot that he saw. He ran into the building, calling out and peering behind the counter to see if anyone was inside. He did not hear a response and did not see anyone behind the counter.Williams then ran around to check on other buildings. Multiple windows of the neighboring liquor store were also blown out, he said. Once he saw authorities arrive, he headed back to the hotel.Nima Tabrizi, 37, of Santa Monica, said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion.“The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off. ... We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.”Palm Springs is about a two-hour drive east of Los Angeles. Its known for upscale resorts, golf courses and a history of celebrity residents.","The FBI says the explosion that damaged a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, was an ‘intentional act of terrorism’ Authorities are still working to confirm the identity of the person who died at the scene.

The New York University decided to withhold the diploma of Logan Rozos , a student who chose to condemn Israel's war in Gaza as 'genocide' at the graduation speech, keeping the administration in dark. His speech drew loud cheers from the audience while the administration said NYU was deeply sorry that the audience had to listen to these remarks.NYU spokesperson John Beckman said Logan's speech was approved previously but on the stage, he deviated from his speech and now the university will take disciplinary action against him.""He lied about the speech he was going to deliver and violated the commitment he made to comply with our rules,"" Beckman said. ""NYU is deeply sorry that the audience was subjected to these remarks and that this moment was stolen by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him.""“The only thing that is appropriate to say in this time, and to a group this large, is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine,” Rozos said to an applauding crowd at the Beacon Theatre.“I want to say that the genocide currently occurring is supported politically and militarily by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars,” he said.“I just want to say I condemn this genocide and complicity in this genocide,” Rozos concluded.Rozos, who is an actor and a member of the Gallatin Theatre Troupe, was chosen to deliver the address. Anti-Defamation Leauge condemned the speech and said no student, especially no Jewish students should have to sit through politicised rhetoric that ""promotes harmful lies about Israel during such a personal milestone"".Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D.-Fla.) said the university has every right to withhold the diploma because he lied to the university. “He lied to the university. Second of all, he lied to everyone listening. There’s no genocide going on in Israel. There is a war, it’s unfortunate,” Moskowitz said“You know, in fact, they can give him his diploma, it’s not going to matter. Good luck getting a job. That was a stupid, selfish thing — ruined the ceremony for a lot of families,” Moskowitz added.","Logan Rozos deviated from his pre-approved speech and called Gaza war 'genocide' in graduation speech.

‘Video Hillary Clinton doesn’t want you to see’: Donald Trump shares clip alleging mysterious deaths of Clinton critics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/video-hillary-clinton-doesnt-want-you-to-see-donald-trump-shares-clip-alleging-mysterious-deaths-of-clinton-critics/articleshow/121240230.cms,"Donald Trump has escalated his feud with Hillary Clinton by sharing a controversial video on Truth Social, implying a connection between Clinton and the deaths of several individuals who opposed her. The video features figures like John F. Kennedy Jr. and Vince Foster, suggesting their deaths were suspiciously convenient for Clinton.

Among those featured in the video were:

John F. Kennedy Jr : The son of President John F. Kennedy died in a 1999 plane crash near Martha’s Vineyard. The video suggests, without evidence, that his death was convenient for Clinton, who was preparing to enter New York politics at the time, a race JFK Jr. was rumoured to consider entering.

US President Donald Trump has reignited his long-running feud with Hillary Clinton by sharing a controversial video, as if defeating her in the 2016 election was not enough for the Republican leader.The clip shared suggests that several people who opposed or questioned the Clintons ended up dead.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump uploaded a video compilation titled “The video Hillary Clinton does not want you to see.” The video implies that numerous figures who were considered hostile, critical, or potentially threatening to Hillary Clinton or her family died under suspicious circumstances.The video doesn’t directly blame Hillary Clinton, but its message is clear and has stirred up conspiracy talk on social media again.Right-wing commentator Laura Loomer reacted to the video on X, saying, “Trump took a blow torch to Hillary Clinton.” She added, “Isn’t it weird how so many people who surround the Clintons have been found dead, been murdered or died from ‘suicide’?”The claims made in the video remain unverified and widely dismissed by mainstream sources as a conspiracy theory.","Donald Trump has shared a video on his social media platform Truth Social.

And don't let them win."" On a question on immigration and the ongoing deportation under the Donald Trump administration, the Game of Thrones actor said it's very scary for him to speak on issues like this.“I want people to be safe and to be protected, and I want very much to live on the right [side] of history,"" he said.“I’m an immigrant”, said Pascal, whose parents fled Pinochet-led Chile when he was nine months old. “We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the US, after asylum in Denmark, and if it weren’t for that, I don’t know what would have happened to us. And so I stand by those needing protection, always.”Asked whether the cast were concerned about reentering the US after making a film (Eddington) with a strong political message, Pascal replied: “Fear is the way they win.

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.
