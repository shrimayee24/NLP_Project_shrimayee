"In a first, Omar calls meet to discuss LG’s decision; Transfer of state officers becomes bone of contention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-omar-calls-meet-to-discuss-lgs-decision-transfer-of-state-officers-becomes-bone-of-contention/articleshow/119954986.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah has convened a meeting Friday to discuss growing tensions over lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s recent transfers of officers, the first time he will examine and debate an administrative decision taken by the Centre-appointed authority.The bone of contention emerged Tuesday when Sinha ordered transfers of 48 Jammu Kashmir Administrative Service (JKAS) officers while the CM and other members of his National Conference (NC) were away for Eid holidays. NC did not name the Centre-appointed Sinha but asserted that no one would be allowed to “play with the democratic set-up”. NC has also taken up the issue with the Centre, party sources said.Sources said Omar wrote Thursday to Union home minister Amit Shah and Sinha expressing concern after chief secretary Atal Dulloo did not comply with CM’s directive to rescind the transfers by the previous evening (April 2). The issue is likely to come up during Shah’s scheduled visit to J&K next week, the sources said.”“The meeting (on Friday) will discuss many issues and on the top of agenda will be recent transfers of UT administrative service officers,” Tanvir Sadiq, NC member and spokesman, told TOI. Sadiq pointed out that the NC govt was democratically elected, sworn in last Oct, and both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Shah had hailed this political process. “We will not allow anyone to scuttle it,” Sadiq said.NC chief whip Mubarik Gul has in a letter to NC legislators said Omar would chair the meeting at the residence of deputy CM Surinder Choudhary. “All are requested to kindly make it convenient to attend the meeting,” Gul wrote.A power-sharing structure between the elected govt and LG in place after the Aug 2019 abrogation of special status under Article 370 that turned J&K into a Union territory has worked in the past six months since NC took office. According to NC, LG has powers to transfer IAS officers, while the elected govt wields similar authority over JKAS cadre.Many NC leaders believed transfers of revenue officers, like SDMs and Tehsildars and projecting them as law-and-order officers, amounted to asserting power over the entire bureaucracy, from a peon to an IAS officer. They say these revenue officials are assigned law and order duty on occasions but that doesn’t bring them under LG. Since J&K became a UT, LG handles the home department.Congress legislatorGA Mir supported ally NC’s position and said LG’s actions showed everything was not well within the J&K administration.However, opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed NC’s “alleged outrage” over the issue, saying nothing would come out of Friday’s meeting. “NC has already surrendered its huge mandate, and to expect any resistance from it, is asking too much. The party has frittered away all opportunities to channel people’s aspirations and seek dignity for them, including constitutional rights. NC is conscious of BJP’s ability to destabilise them (but) resistance is a tall order,” PDP spokesman Naeem Akhtar said.Political analyst Zafar Choudhary acknowledged “some political criticism” over transfers by LG Sinha but asserted that he drew his powers from a “written text stemming from the events of Aug 2019 which no one should pretend to be oblivious of”. “If nothing has been imagined, conceived or planned, leave aside done, to change the terms of engagement, there is no point for any knee-jerk reaction,” Choudhary said.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah has convened a meeting Friday to discuss growing tensions over lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s recent transfers of officers.

Tim Tebow’s White House visit was a reunion of Florida icons with a shared Gator connection

Has Tim Tebow ever supported Donald Trump? Here’s the truth behind their connection

NFL legend and former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow made headlines with a surprise visit to the White House, accompanied by his wife, Demi-Leigh Tebow, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio . The trio met with former President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, where they posed for photos while proudly doing the famous "" Gator Chomp ""—a signature gesture from Tebow’s alma mater, the University of Florida.As soon as images from the meeting surfaced, social media buzzed with speculation about the nature of their visit. While some fans saw it as a simple, friendly gathering, others questioned whether it hinted at a deeper political connection between Tebow and Trump. Given Tebow’s longstanding efforts to remain apolitical, the visit has naturally sparked curiosity and debate.Tim Tebow and Donald Trump have crossed paths before, but this latest visit to the White House was anything but ordinary. Tebow, a celebrated Florida Gators legend, and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida native, were invited to meet Trump in the Oval Office. The trio bonded over their Florida roots, with photos capturing them smiling and performing the ""Gator Chomp,"" a beloved symbol among University of Florida alumni and fans.The meeting was centered around advocacy for child trafficking prevention , not political alignment. This isn’t the first time Tebow has been linked to Trump, but he has historically stayed clear of political endorsements. However, his presence at the White House has left many wondering whether the former quarterback is stepping into new territory.Tim Tebow has been very vocal about the fight against human trafficking and is working hard to make a difference. Through his foundation, he has launched several programs to help rescue and support victims. He also teamed up with Congress to push for stronger laws and better protection for those affected. His goal is to spread awareness and take real action to end human trafficking for good.Back in 2016, Tebow was invited to speak at the Republican National Convention, but he later backed out, explaining that he wanted to focus on his foundation and charitable work instead. While he has met Trump on multiple occasions, including a well-documented golf outing years ago, he has never officially supported the former president—or any politician for that matter.Tebow has built his reputation on faith, sports, and philanthropy rather than politics, which makes this visit particularly intriguing.Also read - New photos of Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld show why he’s the most supportive fiancé","Tim Tebow made a surprise visit to the White House with his wife, Demi-Leigh Tebow, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio.

Who developed US President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariff formula? Mystery continues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-developed-us-president-donald-trumps-liberation-day-tariff-formula-mystery-continues/articleshow/119963323.cms,"US President Donald Trump has announced steep tariffs on its trade partners depending upon the imbalances, rattling the global markets. The brain behind this tariff formula, however, remains a mystery.“Trump used everyone as a sounding board until the very last minute,” a White House official told the New York Post. They added that the individual responsible for developing the formula to address trade imbalances—focusing on more than just tariffs— remained a “mystery to everyone I ask or they’re keeping a secret.”Conflicting statements have further muddled the issue, with some offering contradictory clues about who was responsible. However, senior White House officials on Wednesday pointed to the council of economic advisers , led by economist Stephen Miran, as the group that determined the rates.“The numbers have been calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers using very, very well established methodologies from the International Trade economic literature as well as policy practice. The model they use is based on the concept that the trade deficit that we have with any given country is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating,” the Post quoted an official saying.However, on Thursday, chief White House economist Kevin Hassett said that Greer’s office was the primary force behind the initiative. “What happened was that the US Trade Representative looked at where the trade deficits were and adjusted the tariffs in order to respond,” Hassett said.Announced during a high-profile event in the White House Rose Garden on Liberation Day, the decision has raised fears of a growing trade conflict.The new policy imposes a 34% tariff on Chinese goods, 20% on imports from the European Union, and 24% on Japanese products, while most other countries, including Britain, face a standard 10% tariff.Implemented under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the measures are designed to reduce trade deficits and bolster domestic manufacturing. While Trump argues that the policy is crucial for safeguarding American industries, critics caution that it could lead to economic uncertainty and escalate into a trade war.","US President Donald Trump has announced steep tariffs on its trade partners depending upon the imbalances.

'Well not used as source of drinking water'

INDORE: Eight people suffocated to death in a well in MP's Khandwa district after one person fell in, and the others went in, one by one, to rescue him.No one came back up, and by the time rescuers could reach them, they all lay dead in the mud.Kondawat village, which was celebrating Gangaur festival, is now shrouded in mourning. In fact, the eight men who died were trying to clean the well in preparation for Gangaur immersions.Kondawat is around 120km south of Indore and 15km from the district headquarters. ""A youth fell into the well in the afternoon after the rope broke. He got submerged in the muck and did not come up. Seeing this, one by one, seven other villagers jumped in to save each other but died. It is suspected that toxic gases that had accumulated inside the well led to suffocation and death,"" said Khandwa SP Manoj Rai.Villagers alerted the administration and a 100-strong rescue party sped to Kondawat. Fifteen members of SDERF struggled for hours to reach the victims who had sunk into the mud.The dead were identified as Rakesh, Vasudev, Arjun, Gajanand, Mohan, Ajay, Sharan, and Anil. The bodies have been sent to Khandwa district hospital for autopsy. Preliminary investigations suggest that a drainage channel from the village flows into the well, causing it to turn into a swamp over time. It is believed toxic gases were released due to the contamination.""This well was used only for immersion of idols during festivals. It was not used as a source of drinking water,"" said an official. Collector Rishav Gupta said a compensation of Rs 4 lakh will be handed over to the family members of each victim.","Kondawat village, which was celebrating Gangaur festival, is now shrouded in mourning.

What is the ‘Hands Off!’ rally to take place against Donald Trump?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-hands-off-rally-to-take-place-against-donald-trump/articleshow/119963965.cms,"File photo

Tensions are expected to flare across the United States this Saturday, April 5, as thousands of demonstrators join a wave of anti-Trump protests. Branded under the Hands Off! campaign, organizers have scheduled over 1,000 events nationwide as part of what they’re calling a National Day of Action. A massive turnout is anticipated, with more than 250,000 protestors projected to take part across the country, according to advocacy group MoveOn.The largest of these gatherings is planned for Washington, D.C., where demonstrators will assemble on the National Mall. Attendees are being asked to arrive at the Sylvan Theater around 11 AM, with speeches and programming set to begin at noon. As of early this week, around 12,500 protestors are expected at the D.C. rally, a MoveOn spokesperson confirmed.Many of the demonstrators say they’re marching against what they describe as an unprecedented consolidation of power by Trump and Musk.“Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. They’re taking everything they can get their hands on, and daring the world to stop them,” reads a fiery statement on the Hands Off! campaign website. “On Saturday, April 5th, we’re taking to the streets nationwide to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!”Organizers say this will be the largest coordinated protest event since President Donald Trump began his second term. The demonstration is being led by a coalition of progressive advocacy groups , with MoveOn at the forefront.The speaker lineup for the D.C. event features prominent names in politics and labor activism. Headlining the program is Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin, alongside Florida Representative Maxwell Frost, Everett Kelley of the American Federation of Government Employees , and Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. Additional speakers are expected to be announced in the days leading up to the event. A complete list of partner organizations can be found online.While Trump is the primary target of the Hands Off! campaign, the coalition has widened its scope to include Elon Musk, reflecting growing public frustration with the billionaire. Over the past weekend, protestors gathered outside more than 200 Tesla showrooms across the U.S., amid reports of falling sales and incidents of vandalism.Earlier this year, on Inauguration Day, a similar protest called the People’s March—positioned as a follow-up to the historic 2017 Women’s March—fell short of expectations, drawing fewer than the projected 50,000 participants. But this new movement seems to have struck a stronger nerve, combining political resistance with economic discontent .","Hands Off! organizers have scheduled over 1,000 events nationwide as part of what they’re calling a National Day of Action.

A senior Palestinian official told the outlet that the group, through its mediators, conveyed its readiness to free all captives, provided that Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza completely.However, It still remains unclear whether the proposal will gain any acceptance as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently ruled out any agreement that does not include Hamas’ total defeat, including disarmament and its full removal from Gaza.While Hamas continues insisting both sides to adhere to the original US-brokered ceasefire framework from January, the group appears to have tempered its stance, now recognising that a permanent truce may not be immediately possible..“We had no other choice. The situation in Gaza is terrible,” one official said, highlighting the dire humanitarian toll.Palestinian representatives added that Hamas may also be open to phased releases in exchange for short-term truces. In a recent proposal presented by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Hamas agreed to release five hostages in return for a temporary ceasefire. The deal was rejected by Israel which demanded the release of 11 living captives and the return of the bodies of 16 deceased individuals, New York Post reported.Hamas negotiators have not responded to the Israeli counter-proposal and deemed the demands unacceptable. The group insists that any path to a full hostage release must involve Israel eventually agreeing to talks around a permanent ceasefire. They maintain that disarmament is off the table as long as Palestinian statehood remains unrecognised.For now, peace talks are “at a standstill,” Palestinian officials confirmed.Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces are executing a plan to isolate the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, further segmenting the territory into three areas. The IDF already controls the northern border and seeks to occupy roughly 25 per cent of the Gaza Strip in its latest push.The humanitarian crisis continues to escalate with more than 50,000 people having died in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Aid and food supplies remain heavily restricted under the ongoing blockade.Inside Israel, Netanyahu is also under growing domestic pressure. Families of the remaining hostages, believed to include just 24 living individuals such as Israeli-American Edan Alexander, are staging protests, accusing the government of prioritising political objectives over the safe return of their loved ones.",Hamas is willing to release the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza on the condition that Israel agrees to a permanent ceasefire.

Is Elon Musk stepping down from DOGE?



Right-wing political commentator Megyn Kelly reacted to the news reports that President Donald Trump confirmed to his close aides that Elon Musk would be stepping down from his government role. Though both Elon Musk and White House rubbished the reports and asserted that it was obvious to happen as Elon has been working on a time-bound project, Megyn Kelly said the US is lucky to have someone like Elon, willing to touch the government with a 10-ft pole.""It's not like Taylor Swift. She got booed at the Superbowl because she got political, and she alienated half her fan base and half of the country and when I see her today, do I feel bd for her? Not at all. You put yourself out there. You did not need to get political. But in her case, it was utterly pointless. You have no political swing, you just wanted to feel like you are more important..."" Meghyn said, explaining that Elon's involvement in politics was not pointless.It has been very hard for Elon Musk as nobody now wants to buy a Tesla the way Tesla vehicles are coming under attack, Kelly said adding that though Elon Musk is protected by the Department of Justice, people like former VP candidate Tim Walz are celebrating the attack on Tesla; people are doing hate crimes against Tesla.Kelly said it was important for the nation that Elon Musk turned political unlike Taylor Swift. ""Elon actually did help Trump get elected. He did move the needle and there is no question about that.""In a Fox interview, Elon Musk recently said that most of his work is done and he would be wrapping up DOGE work soon. Donald Trump reportedly told his inner circle that he's very happy with what Elon Musk did in terms of cutting down on government expenditure but as Elon has so many businesses to handle, he would go back to his own work.

""In a word, it’s nationalism,” Vance said.""In our foreign policy and our economic policy, we have a president who’s going to put the interests of Americans first and that means in our economic policy, we’re going to fight back against ridiculous trade practices. In our foreign policy, we’re going to stop starting stupid wars. But we’re also going to ensure that America’s enemies respect America’s national interests and that means we need access to critical resources. That means that we need our allies and ourselves to have missile security, to have national security, to make our own weapons if God forbid a war would start,"" Vance said.""Economic security is connected to national security because, if God forbid, we had to go to war, we want our troops to go to war with the best equipment and equipment that’s made in the United States of America. The president mentioned this in his remarks today: that we’re in a situation where if we went to war against a country that made our pharmaceuticals, our kids wouldn’t have access to antibiotics.

Extremism In Canada: Canada Election 2025: Why Conservative candidate Don Patel was dropped for heart-hugging emoji,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-election-2025-why-conservative-candidate-don-patel-was-dropped-for-heart-hugging-emoji/articleshow/119947319.cms,"Khalistan is not just a movement



Nijjar and Pakistan: The missing context



A symptom of a larger problem



Trudeau’s India problem



""Clandestine info-gathering techniques, coercive tactics targeting Canadians"": Trudeau accuses India amid diplomatic row

The fire is still burning



Don Patel , the Conservative Party ’s candidate for Etobicoke North, was removed from the 2025 federal election campaign after endorsing a controversial social media post that called for the deportation of certain individuals to India.The post — vague in its language but widely interpreted as referring to Khalistani supporters — read: “Should be stop these people by Canadian government and deported to India then PM Modi can take care of these non-sense people.” Patel responded with a heart-hugging emoji, a gesture interpreted as support.While the Conservative Party acted swiftly to drop Patel, calling his engagement with the post “clearly unacceptable,” the incident taps into a far more complex and volatile political reality — one that has shaped Canada’s domestic discourse and foreign policy for decades: the shadow of the Khalistan movement and its ties to terrorism, extremism, and diplomatic fallout.The Khalistan movement — which advocates for an independent Sikh state carved out of India’s Punjab — is often painted in Canada as a freedom struggle or diasporic identity cause. But in India, and among large sections of the South Asian community in Canada, it carries far darker connotations.In 1985, Khalistani extremists were responsible for the bombing of Air India Flight 182 , also known as Air Kanishka, which exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing 329 people, including 268 Canadians. It remains the deadliest act of aviation terrorism before 9/11 — and the worst mass killing in Canadian history. Despite overwhelming evidence and a lengthy investigation, only one person was convicted. The rest either walked free or were never tried. For many, the lack of justice remains an open wound, especially within the Indo-Canadian community.To this day, the attack is a chilling reminder that Khalistan is not just an idea — it has been weaponized, quite literally, to devastating effect.The issue gained new life in 2023, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian government agents of assassinating Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Canadian citizen and a prominent Khalistan activist, outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia. The charge triggered a diplomatic firestorm. India vehemently denied the allegations and pointed to Nijjar’s history of extremism — a history often sanitized in Canadian public discourse.Indian intelligence reports claim that Nijjar was not merely an activist but was receiving arms training in Pakistan, under the protection of groups hostile to both India and the West. He was reportedly linked to efforts to revive Sikh militancy and recruit for separatist causes from Canadian soil. A Canada commission report later concluded that there was no 'definitive link' between any foreign hand and Nijjar's assassination.While Canada’s position has focused on the principle of sovereignty and the rule of law, India has maintained that its core concern is the growing use of Canadian territory as a safe haven for extremist networks — a concern echoed by many Indian-origin Canadians who feel their voices are drowned out by politically mobilized fringe groups.Patel’s post reflects a simmering frustration in some corners of the diaspora. The belief that Canada has turned a blind eye to extremism — in part due to political expediency — is not isolated to Delhi. Many Indo-Canadians, particularly Hindus and moderate Sikhs, have grown increasingly uneasy with the Canadian politicians' perceived softness on Khalistani extremism. Ironically, Patel’s removal was likely a bid to prevent his statement from playing into Liberal attacks, but the damage is done. It reinforces the perception that Canada's political parties are deeply entangled in diaspora vote-bank politics — where foreign conflicts are imported and amplified for domestic gain.All of this unfolds against the backdrop of former PM Justin Trudeau’s own spectacular fall from grace — a decline in which India played a central role. His 2018 India visit, remembered more for Bollywood costumes than diplomacy, first exposed the Trudeau government’s naivety on South Asian geopolitics. His 2023 Nijjar allegation turned naivety into outright rupture.Trudeau’s attempt to walk the tightrope — appeasing domestic Khalistani activists while maintaining bilateral ties — collapsed under the weight of realpolitik. India retaliated by cutting visas, expelling diplomats, and cancelling trade talks. Even traditional allies like the U.S. and Australia were tepid in their support, unwilling to sacrifice relations with India for Trudeau’s crusade.Don Patel’s removal is not the end of this story — it’s merely another flare-up in a fire that has been smouldering for decades. As Canada heads into the 2025 election, the nation must confront uncomfortable truths: that diaspora politics have consequences, that extremism can hide in plain sight, and that failing to reckon with history — from Air India to Nijjar — invites its repetition.In this volatile mix, politicians like Don Patel may come and go, but the deeper reckoning still lies ahead.",Don Patel was removed from the 2025 federal election campaign after endorsing a controversial social media post that called for the deportation of certain individuals to India.

I also like him, personally,” Trump said during a conversation with Fox News aboard Air Force One.Trump's remarks were in response to Musk’s future as a “special government employee” linked to the DOGE project.“We're in no rush. But there will be a point at which time Elon's going to have to leave,"" Trump said.The President's comments came amid reports that Musk may soon exit his temporary government role, purportedly because members of Trump’s inner circle had discussed concerns over Tesla chief's “unpredictability” and potential as a “political liability.”Despite the speculation, Trump made it clear he remains a staunch supporter of Musk. “Elon is fantastic. He's a patriot,” he told reporters. “He can stay at the White House as long as he'd like,” adding again that he wants him to stay “as long as possible.”Trump also hinted that the work being done was of major significance. “The secretaries” in the Cabinet will take over Musk’s responsibilities after his departure, Trump said, noting that today, that work uncovered something “horrible” and “incredible,” though he declined to elaborate.Vice President JD Vance also backed Musk amid reports of his stepping down, saying: “The fake news always tries to take the strongest members of the President’s team and attack them and tear them down.""The DOGE office was established by an executive order Trump signed on January 20.

Musk’s tenure, which began on Inauguration Day, is expected to conclude around May 30, unless reassigned.When asked whether Musk might be offered another position in the administration to extend his involvement, Trump responded, “I would.

A British judge has ordered US President Donald Trump to pay more than 625,000 pounds (approximately $820,000) in legal fees to a consulting firm he sued unsuccessfully over a controversial intelligence dossier.The payment stems from a case Trump brought in 2022 against Orbis Business Intelligence , the firm established by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.Steele had been commissioned by Democratic Party operatives in 2016 to compile a dossier containing damaging claims about Trump, some of which sparked major political debates ahead of his first presidential inauguration.That dossier alleged Trump had been “compromised” by Russia’s security services, including through salacious claims that he had participated in “sex parties” in St. Petersburg and engaged with sex workers in Moscow. Trump has consistently denied these accusations, calling them completely false.In a written statement submitted to the court, Trump said the allegations were “wholly untrue.” He emphasized he had never engaged in “perverted sexual behavior including the hiring of prostitutes ... in the presidential suite of a hotel in Moscow,” nor had he taken part in “sex parties” in St. Petersburg, bribed Russian officials, or given them “sufficient material to blackmail me.”The legal battle came to a close in February 2024, when Judge Karen Steyn dismissed Trump’s claim. She ruled that the lawsuit had no real prospect of success, partly because of the significant delay in bringing the case. Steyn’s ruling did not address the veracity of the allegations themselves but concluded that the case was “bound to fail.”Trump had argued that Orbis breached U.K. data protection laws and that the contents of the Steele dossier were fictitious. His legal team described the allegations as “shocking and scandalous claims” that had caused significant harm to his reputation.Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Trump was initially required to pay an instalment of 290,000 pounds toward Orbis’s legal expenses. After failing to make that payment, a separate hearing was held to determine the full costs.On Thursday, Judge Jason Rowley concluded that Trump must pay 626,058.98 pounds, with interest on the amount accruing daily at a rate of 12%. Trump's legal team had earlier criticized the legal fee demand, claiming it had been set “absolutely outrageously high.”","US President Donald Trump must pay more than 625,000 pounds (approximately $820,000) in legal fees to a consulting firm.

No power to do any of this: 19 states in US sue Trump's election order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-power-to-do-any-of-this-19-states-in-us-sue-trumps-election-order/articleshow/119961573.cms,"US President Donald Trump’s latest executive order on elections faces legal challenge by Democratic attorneys general from 19 states, arguing it is an unconstitutional attempt to override states’ authority. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in a US district court in Massachusetts, aimed to block key provisions of the order, which imposes stricter voting requirements nationwide.The executive order, issued just a week ago, demanded individuals to provide documentary proof of citizenship while registering to vote and required all mail-in ballots to be received by the election day. These measures, the lawsuit contended, breach upon states’ constitutional right to regulate their own elections.The suit said that the Constitution allows states to set their own election rules, letting them decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run.“The President has no power to do any of this,” the attorneys general stated in their court filing. “The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American,” news agency AP quoted.Trump’s order claimed that the country has failed to enforce what he called ""basic and necessary election protection."" However, election officials across the country have repeatedly argued that recent elections have been among the most secure in US history, with no evidence of widespread fraud.The order is the latest move in Trump’s long-standing campaign against US election processes. In 2020, after losing to Democrat Joe Biden, Trump claimed the election was ""rigged"" and accused voting machines of manipulation.Trump argued that his executive order will help prevent illegal voting by noncitizens, despite multiple studies showing that such cases are exceedingly rare. The order has received backing from Republican election officials in several states, who claim it could help combat voter fraud and allow better access to federal data for maintaining voter rolls.However, critics warned that the order could lead to widespread voter disenfranchisement as many states currently count mail-in ballots postmarked by election day, and others allow voters to correct minor ballot errors.The order threatened to cut federal funding for states that refuse to comply, which Democratic officials argue is an overreach of presidential power.“We are a democracy – not a monarchy – and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,” said New York attorney general Letitia James.Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha also accused Trump of attempting to sidestep Congress and strong-arm states into compliance.“In one fell swoop, this president is attempting to undermine elections and sidestep the Congress, and we’re not going to stand for it,” he said.Officials in Nevada, a key swing state, also pushed back, calling their elections “fair, secure, and transparent.” California attorney general Rob Bonta denounced the order as a sweeping attempt to impose voting restrictions and suppress voter turnout.Other lawsuits filed against the order argued that millions of eligible voters may be unable to meet the new documentation requirements. While citizens are already required to attest to their status under penalty of perjury, Trump’s order limited acceptable proof to a US passport, a Real ID-compliant driver’s license that explicitly states citizenship, or a valid photo ID accompanied by additional proof of citizenship.Democrats argued that these restrictions would disproportionately impact Americans without easy access to birth certificates, as well as women who have changed their names after marriage. A similar requirement in New Hampshire recently caused issues for some women voting in local elections.","Democratic attorneys general from 19 states filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump's latest executive order on elections.

Trump fires 3 national security officials over concerns they are not loyal: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-fires-3-national-security-officials-over-concerns-they-are-not-loyal-report/articleshow/119960836.cms,"President Trump fired at least three senior national security council officials after an extraordinary meeting in Oval Office with far-right activist Laura Loomer, who laid out a list of people she believed were disloyal to Trump, according to a US official with direct knowledge of the matter.Other members of NSC are expected to be fired as part of the purge, the official added. Some of those officials had been detailed to the council and were sent back to their home agencies over the weekend, even before the meeting held Wednesday. Loomer has been part of a group effort by Trump allies to disparage members of his White House staff. The campaign has included online attacks about the members' families, past employment and aspects of their backgrounds, including professional associations, that have been used to claim they were either disloyal or ideologically unfit to serve in his administration.The agitators have used the phrase ""neocon"" - short for neoconservative - to describe many of those working for NSA Michael Waltz . The insinuation is that the officials are too hawkish, too eager to commit American troops around the world and fundamentally at odds with Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy.Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about the Sept 11 attacks, presented her findings directly to Trump. The meeting was attended by Waltz and V-P JD Vance. For now, one of her top targets, the deputy NSA Alex Wong, has been spared, the official said. It is unclear what the firings mean for Waltz, who has a tenuous hold on his own job. Trump has so far declined to terminate Waltz after he inadvertently invited the Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg onto a Signal group chat in which top officials shared sensitive details about forthcoming strikes against Houthi terrorists.","Other members of NSC are expected to be fired as part of the purge, the official added.

The Pentagon inspector general's office will investigate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of commercial messaging app Signal to discuss air strikes on Yemen, a memo released Thursday said. The review will also look at other defense officials’ use of the publicly available encrypted app, which is not able to handle classified material and is not part of the Defense Department’s secure communications network.“The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,” the acting inspector general, Steven Stebbins, said in a notification letter to Hegseth.A major scandal broke out after journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic claimed that he was mistakenly added to a Signal group by national security adviser Mike Waltz. The group included Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and others, brought together to discuss March 15 military operations against the Iran-backed Houthis.The review was launched at the request of Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the committee’s top Democrat.The investigation comes as the Donald Trump administration played down the apparent leak and said no war plan was being discussed in the group. Mike Waltz came under fire as the journalist was added to the group from his phone. Waltz said he did not know the journalist and did not even have his number saved on his phone -- a claim that Goldberg rubbished.Donald Trump said he would not fire Waltz, though reports claimed he deliberated about it as vice president JD Vance too pitched for Waltz's ouster.","The Pentagon inspector general's office will investigate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of commercial messaging app Signal to discuss air strikes on Yemen.

Howard Lutnick On Trump Tariff: 'Let Trump run the global economy': Howard Lutnick says there's no way Trump would back off on tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/let-trump-run-the-global-economy-howard-lutnick-says-theres-no-way-trump-would-back-off-on-tariffs/articleshow/119954177.cms,"Trump tariff mastermind Howard Lutnick said there's no way the president would back off on reciprocal tariffs.

This is a proven economic formula that works: White House



Donald Trump's commerce secretary Howard Lutnick Thursday said that people should just let the president run the global economy because he knows what he has been doing. He's been talking about it for 35 years, Lutnick said defending the Trump tariffs that led to a market meltdown hours after they were announced. President Trump imposed a base level 10% tariff across the countries extending up to 50%.Lutnick's comment was seen as absurd as the commerce secretary on CNN was also live fact-checked on his other claims that he made.One of the masterminds behind the Trump tariffs, Lutnick confirmed that Trump is not going to back off on his proposed tariffs though there is a week before these tariffs come into force. “The president is not going to back off,"" he said. Countries can fix their tariffs” and non-tariff trade barriers, which he said are “much, much rougher.” “America has got to stop being exploited… and then, and only then, will Donald Trump make a deal with each country,” he said.“Let him fix it. I understand. It’s broken. Let him fix it. Our 36 trillion dollar deficit, right, is going to ruin our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” Lutnick said. “Let Donald Trump fix the American economy.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NewsNation that the tariff won't impact US workers and companies. “There’s not going to be any pain for American-owned companies and American workers, because their jobs are going to come back home,” Leavitt said.“This is a proven economic formula that works, and the American people should trust in Trump. That’s why they elected him back to the White House,” Leavitt said.Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus have not been included in the list of the countries that would face reciprocal tariffs. White House said it was done because these four nations are already facing extremely high tariffs and US' previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries.China faces the highest tariff, 34 per cent, that will be imposed on top of a previously implemented 20 percent tariff for a total 54 percent tariff on goods. Other high numbers include 46 per cent on Vietnam, 32 per cent on Taiwan, 32 per cent on Indonesia and 49 per cent on Cambodia.","Lutnick's comment was seen as absurd as the commerce secretary on CNN was also live fact-checked on his other claims that he made. “America has got to stop being exploited… and then, and only then, will Donald Trump make a deal with each country,” he said.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists.

However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

Rajab Butt: Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-youtuber-slapped-with-blasphemy-charges-over-perfume-launch/articleshow/119484680.cms,"Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch (Picture credit: X)

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

"Balochistan Government: Balochistan government tightens control, decides to suppress dissent with stringent measures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/balochistan-government-tightens-control-decides-to-suppress-dissent-with-stringent-measures/articleshow/119471005.cms,"Balochistan government tightens control, decides to suppress dissent with stringent measures (Picture credit: ANI)

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.
