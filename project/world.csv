SRINAGAR: Two Pakistani terrorists were killed in separate security operations Wednesday in north Kashmir — one at Ketson in Bandipora and another in Kupwara’s Lolab area . An M4 carbine was found near the slain terrorist in Bandipora. “The forces found an AK-47 rifle, two hand grenades, and four magazines after shooting dead a terrorist in the Kupwara gunfight,” an official said.Both seek-and-kill operations were part of an intensified crackdown on terrorists following an uptick in attacks across Kashmir valley — including the murder of seven tunnel construction workers in Ganderbal on Oct 20 — since an elected govt took office in J&K after six years last month.The security sweep has led to seven fatalities among terrorists so far, including two in Bandipora on Nov 5, Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Usman from Pakistan in Srinagar on Nov 2, and another two in Anantnag the same day. However, terrorists retaliated with a grenade attack on Nov 3, wounding 12 people in a busy Srinagar market.Officials said security forces were on the hunt since a group of terrorists engaged a search party in a brief gunfight and escaped deep inside Panar forest in Bandipora on Nov 1. The slain terrorist at Ketson is believed to be from the same group.",Two Pakistani terrorists were killed in separate security operations Wednesday in north Kashmir.

When the results came, they melted into the collective gloom of Thulasendrapuram, the ancestral village of the US Democratic presidential candidate in Tiruvarur.Villagers in groups sat glued to television and mobile phone screens from early morning. When trends showed Kamala trailing, they didn't give up on her. When Donald Trump's victory became certain, the residents of this agrarian patch were crestfallen.J Suthakar, who organised a 'pride parade' in the village, could not accept Kamala's defeat. ""We prayed for Kamala's victory, but she lost. We hope she wins next time,"" he said, grudgingly 'congratulating' Trump.Four years ago, on Nov 8, 2020, Thulasendrapuram celebrated Kamala's victory as US vice-president. On Wednesday, they remained loyal to their 'daughter of the soil'. ""Whether she wins or not, competing for the US President post is a matter of prestige for all of us,"" said R Vijayakumar, who oversees the village's overhead water tank. Thulasendrapuram residents were not the only ones who offered prayers for Kamala. Joy Holtz, a tourist from Chicago and Dujatha, an Indian-origin resident of Seattle, prayed at Kamala's ancestral Sri Dharma Sastha temple in the village. ""It's hard for me to accept Kamala Harris's defeat. I feel terrible. It shows the American people are still not willing to elect an Indian-American and a woman. I wish Donald Trump well. I hope he promotes unity not diversity,"" said Joy, who voted for Kamala electronically from India six weeks ago.Suthakar had planned to prepare and serve villagers idli and sambar to celebrate Kamala's victory. On Tuesday, he organised a special puja at the ancestral temple. The shrine has a plaque that announces a donation of Rs 5,000 made by Kamala Harris and her aunt Dr Sarala Gopalan for the 2014 consecration, and Rs 250 from her maternal grandfather P V Gopalan who used to live in Thulasendrapuram.","Four years ago, on Nov 8, 2020, Thulasendrapuram celebrated Kamala's victory as US vice-president.

Under Trump and Modi, the two nations had common stance on several issues

For India, Donald Trump 's return to White House isn't just an acceptable but a desired outcome of US presidential elections , given Trump 1.0's perceived strategic convergence of interests with India and his close rapport with Narendra Modi Unsurprisingly, the PM was among the first heads of states to congratulate ""my friend"" Trump, shortly after the latter's victory speech in Florida. Modi's post on X was embellished with photos from his engagement with the US President-elect in the past, including during his visit to India in 2020.According to former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla who served as ambassador to US during Trump 1.0, his comeback is good news for India and inspires confidence that he will start from where he left off at the end of his first term. ""Modi govt has worked closely with Trump in the past and he also has a good relationship with Modi,"" Shringla said, adding Trump's pledge to bring peace in Gaza and Ukraine also aligns with Modi's ""this is not an era of war"" stand.Under Trump and Modi, the two nations had common stance on several issues, especially counterterrorism and Chinese assertiveness in Indo-Pacific.It was then that Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level, and foundational military agreements between India and US, notably Beca and Comcasa, were signed.Significantly, it was during this time that the term 'Indo-Pacific', a euphemism for calling China out over its expansionism, gained geopolitical traction.Trump's victory also spares Indian officials the trouble of dealing with a relatively unknown entity in Kamala Harris.","For India, Donald Trump's return to White House isn't just an acceptable but a desired outcome.

Donald Trump: US Presidential Election 2024 Results: 11 reasons why Kamala Harris lost badly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-2024-results-11-reasons-why-kamala-harris-lost-badly/articleshow/115023169.cms,"Donald Trump secured a decisive victory in 2024, sweeping all swing states and defeating Kamala Harris by substantial margins. Polls had predicted a close race, but Harris underperformed even Biden’s 2020 results. Her campaign, rushed and marred by shifting policies, struggled to resonate with voters, particularly in swing states. Mainstream media’s attacks on Trump only fueled his alternative media rise, appealing to minority voters disillusioned with Democrats. Trump's clear policy stances and minority outreach contrasted sharply with Harris’s unclear positions, leaving her vulnerable. The race highlighted persistent societal divides, with Harris’s identity perceived as a barrier for some voters.

1) No Time to Prepare

2) Interview Doom Loop

3) MSM Playing Nero

4) Rise of New Media

5) Shrill Surrogates

6) Trump Minority Outreach

7) U-Turns on Major Policies and a ""No Comment"" Strategy

8) MAGA Kulturkampf Triumph

9) Reverse Swing in Swing States

10) The ""DEI"" Candidate

11) America won't vote for a woman

In the end, it wasn’t close at all. Donald Trump swept all seven swing states , easily paving the way to the White House. Polls had suggested a neck-and-neck race, but Harris lost every swing state and performed even worse than Joe Biden in every county. Trump's triumph signals the end of the liberal order established with Barack Obama’s presidency in 2008, which saw Democrats dominate the narrative and shape much of American culture, from the media to Hollywood. Now, with Donald Trump – a convicted felon – back in the White House, the tables have turned. Trump achieved numerous firsts, including becoming the first president since Grover Cleveland to serve non-consecutive terms and dismantling the so-called ""Blue Wall.""Planning a presidential campaign in just four months was a tall order, and Harris, stuck with Biden’s team , struggled to articulate her message. She was forced to reverse positions on key policies , including those on illegal immigration and gender-affirming care, which eroded public confidence.Initially, Harris refused interviews, leading polls by 3.6 points in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. Silicon Valley investor David Sacks warned she could fall into a “doom loop” : as her ratings dropped, she’d be forced to give more interviews, further harming her standing. This proved true, with her ratings plummeting from 3.6 to 1.4 points just before Election Day.The media's role should be to inform the public, yet, over the past eight years, mainstream outlets have been preoccupied with attacking Trump. They frequently distorted facts, as seen when they misinterpreted Trump’s comment about violence rather than a critique of her “war hawk” view s. Even comedy shows leaned into anti-Trump narratives, reinforcing biases rather than fostering critical discourse. And they also committed the worst crime of all time, not even being funny.With mainstream media missing the mark, alternative platforms have gained prominence, allowing people to judge Trump independently. Platforms like X, owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, and podcasts such as The Joe Rogan Experience have helped Trump redefine his image, distancing him from labels like “fascist” and “bigot.” In today’s media landscape, where figures like Joe Rogan hold as much influence as major celebrities, Trump’s alternative media appearances have countered the negative portrayals from traditional outlets.As Harris’s ratings dipped, her surrogates grew desperate. Hillary Clinton likened a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi gathering, while Obama admonished Black men for not backing Harris. Figures like Tim Walz and AOC tried to turn a Puerto Rican joke into a headline. At times, it felt like the Puerto Rico joke - no matter how crude, got more coverage than two assassination attempts on Trump.Trump extended his reach to minority groups. His pro-business stance and ties with Indian PM Narendra Modi appealed to conservative Indian Americans. Among African Americans, he capitalised on frustrations with the Democratic Party, drawing young Black men with promises of economic opportunity. Endorsements from Arab American leaders in Michigan boosted his support, particularly among those critical of US involvement in the Middle East. His Hispanic support, though somewhat affected by a Puerto Rican joke, grew due to his positions on economic issues, immigration, and crime. Kamala Harris ’s reluctance to commit to clear policy positions backfired. By avoiding firm stances on former progressive policies, she created an impression of evasiveness, which alienated voters. She was also seen as the ""No Comment"" candidate, one could win by not alienating voters. It was a rather hard sell though. For example, you can't claim to be the champion of recreational marijuana use when you have a history of locking up recreational marijuana users. Conversely, Trump’s direct, if polarising, policy positions won him a loyal base, securing a clear victory. Harris’s avoidance left her vulnerable to attacks, with voters gravitating toward a candidate with a more defined agenda.MAGA hasn't just cannibalised the Conservative movement, it has also challenged the Democratic Party’s liberal world order. Issues like the trans movement and identity politics have alienated some traditional Democratic voters, and MAGA has reframed debates on immigration as conflicts between illegal immigrants and minority communities. This was evidenced in Harris' own behaviour who left behind many of her more progressive policies to become a 'moderate'. For normal people, there is no hesistancy in saying that men shouldn't participate in women's sports or that grown men - irrespective of how they identity - shouldn't use bathrooms. It was a hard task, getting women to vote for Harris after spending so long not being able to define a woman. The MAGA messaging on these issues hit home and this electoral reversal will perhaps force the Dems to come back to normal centre.Harris, much like Indian batsmen from the 90s, failed to deal with the swing. Of course, in Harris' case, it was the key swing states, losing ground that Joe Biden had previously held. Her failure to connect with working-class voters on issues like the economy and immigration cost her in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In Florida and Arizona, Harris’s appeal fell flat with Latino voters, who leaned towards Trump’s stances on jobs and border security. Her campaign’s missteps across these pivotal states led to a complete swing-state wipeout, blocking her path to victory.Kamala Harris’s ascension to the Democratic nomination had sparked criticism, with some labelling her a “DEI candidate” – suggesting her rise was due to diversity priorities over electoral support. This narrative cast doubt on her qualifications, overshadowing her roles as attorney general, senator, and vice president. Unlike Clinton, Harris was virtually given the nomination after Biden dropped out. VPs are often picked to complement the POTUS of the day. Becoming the main focus is a different matter. Her campaign, burdened by these assumptions, ultimately failed to resonate widely, underscoring the unique challenges faced by Black women in leadership, where their achievements are often undermined by questions around race and gender.There’s an unspoken reality within American politics, underscored by historical and present-day facts. The US has longstanding issues with racism and misogyny. Abraham Lincoln had to lead the country into a civil war to end slavery. It wasn’t until 1920 that women gained the right to vote, and only in 1965 were voting rights fully extended to all Black citizens. Jim Crow laws continued to suppress Black rights across states well after the Civil War. The country has elected a Black president only once and has yet to see a female president. For many American voters, possibly including Black voters, casting a ballot for a candidate who is both half-Indian and half-Black felt like a great leap—regardless of the opponent. Even in 2024, it was a bridge too far for America to cross.","Kamala Harris lost every swing state and performed even worse than Joe Biden in every county.

The surprising height of 18-year-old Barron Trump again became the internet's talking point after Donald Trump's return to the White House was smoothly sealed in a comfortable projected margin against vice president Kamala Harris. Barron Trump spent his childhood in the White House and the White House will again get to see a lot of 6'9'' Barron -- as this time he was his father's unofficial social media adviser. Barron is Trump's youngest son with Melania and is studying Business at New York University. Barron will not be a permanent resident of the White House as he will stay in New York for his college and Melania too is unlikely to shift her base to Washington from New York full time.All the Trumps are tall including Melania but Barron's height is shocking and he clearly dominates the room he's in. His father did not miss a chance to speak about his height every time he appeared on a podcast as he also mentioned how smart Barron is and how he knows a lot about the internet, cryptocurrency etc.Donald Trump is believed to be 6 feet 2 inches tall and Melania is 5 feet 9 inches. It's no wonder that Barron is so tall but Donald Trump thinks it had something to do with the food that Melania's mother Amalija Knavs cooked. ""Boy, did she take care of Barron. That’s how he got so tall – he only ate her food,"" Trump explained earlier.A new photo of Barron Trump casting his vote Tuesday went viral.

Will we see Donald Trump return to WWE anytime soon?

The Battle of the Billionaires takes place at WrestleMania 23

Newly elected President Donald Trump set a new record by becoming the only two-time President of the United States to be associated with the WWE. Although he’s been associated with the Stamford-based promotion before he began either of his Presidential runs, he’s been a recurring figure with the WWE.That said, his major involvement with the company happened during WrestleMania 23, during the Battle of the Billionaires , where he was involved in a feud with former WWE Chairman, Vince McMohan. So, will we see him return to the ring anytime soon?At this point, it’s unlikely that Donald Trump will return to the WWE ring anytime soon. That’s because he’s been elected as President, and will be in office for the next five years. So it’s safe to say that he won’t be involved with the company. However, once his tenure ends, there’s a chance that he might be seen in the Stamford-based promotion once again, but then again, it’s too early to say that.For the Battle of the Billionaires, Vince McMohan chose Umaga as his wrestler, while Trump went with Lashley. When the former secured victory, McMohan had to lose his hair in front of a live audience. Despite several stellar attractions in the form of matches, it’s believed that Trump being present and involved with the event was the reason why the event was so popular.Apart from the Battle of the Billionaires, the only other major storyline that he was involved in was when he claimed to have bought RAW from Vince McMohan. This was all a storyline and WWE even released a mock press release to add a touch of authenticity to the matter. However, Wall Street took this seriously, causing the WWE stocks to drop by 7% instantly.Within a week of this happening, Vince McMohan was forced to hold yet another segment in the ring where he bought RAW back from his adversary at an exorbitant price. Following that segment, WWE has never indulged in such storylines because it could potentially be detrimental to their finances once again.That said, many WWE wrestlers including Kane and Hulk Hogan have campaigned for Trump during his 2024 Election Campaign , which further goes on to show how deeply he’s involved with the wrestling promotion and the wrestlers as a whole.Also read: From the Ring to the Ballot: Kane Celebrates Trump’s Presidential Win","Donald Trump is the only two-time President of the United States to be associated with the WWE.

JD Vance , a 40-year-old senator and staunch ally of Donald Trump , elected as the next vice president of the United States on Wednesday, becoming the third-youngest person and one of the most divisive figures to hold the office. In a message after his victory, Vance expressed heartfelt gratitude to his Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance , writing on X, “THANK YOU! To my beautiful wife for making it possible to do this.”Vance also extended his appreciation to President-elect Donald Trump and the American people. ""To President Donald J Trump, for giving me such an opportunity to serve our country at this level. And to the American people, for their trust. I will never stop fighting for ALL of you,"" he wrote.Only two years after beginning his first public office as a senator from Ohio, Vance is set to become the nation’s 50th vice president. His trajectory to this role has been unlike that of any modern vice president, given his early history as a vocal critic of Trump, whom he once likened to ""cultural heroin.""Vance rose to prominence in 2016 with his memoir, which offered a perspective on the frustrations and struggles of the white working class that were key to Trump’s initial rise. Seen as a bridge between conservative Midwesterners and liberal readers, Vance initially opposed Trump, frequently voicing his disapproval.However, as he prepared for his own political career, Vance underwent a transformation, becoming a fierce defender of the man he once criticised. Trump’s eventual endorsement helped Vance secure a tight four-way Republican primary in Ohio and later played a critical role in his Senate victory.Now, Vance’s political fortunes are inextricably tied to Trump’s influence. As one of the most indebted vice presidents to a sitting president in recent memory, his loyalty marks a new chapter in the role, according to Joel Goldstein, an emeritus professor at St. Louis University School of Law and an expert on the vice presidency.","JD Vance, a 40-year-old senator and staunch ally of Donald Trump, elected as the next vice president of the United States on Wednesday.

Donald Trump: What happens to Donald Trump's criminal cases after he becomes President? Can he pardon himself?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-happens-to-donald-trumps-criminal-cases-after-he-becomes-president-can-he-pardon-himself/articleshow/115013921.cms,"Charges Trump is facing

Will Trump self-pardon himself?

As Donald Trump is poised to take over the Oval Office, all eyes are on some of the serious criminal charges against him, which also include federal cases.The second term could help Trump do away with federal indictments accusing him of mishandling classified documents and seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. According to reports, prosecutors will find new, and possibly fatal, legal hurdles to what have already been complex and unprecedented proceedings.Former chief of the Manhattan District Attorney's trial division Karen Friedman Agnifilo said, ""If he wins, say goodbye to all the criminal cases.""According to ABC News, Friedman suggested that a victory for the former US president in the elections would serve as a ""get out of jail free card"" for him.In the, Trump was convicted of falsifying his business records to cover up the payment of $130,000 made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. This was likely the first criminal case against a former or current US president.According to a report from ABC News, the sentencing could still proceed in November if Trump wins the election, though the new circumstances could influence Judge Merchan's decision, according to Boston College law professor Jeffrey Cohen.""A sitting president wouldn't be forced to be incarcerated while they're serving their presidency, and so he could theoretically serve it once he's out of office,"" said Cohen.In the, Trump faces charges for illegally attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. Trump's criminal case in Fulton County, Georgia has been stalled since June.As state cases in Georgia and Manhattan are beyond the Department of Justice's jurisdiction, Trump would have a much harder time influencing them as president. Experts have argued that it is unlikely for them to proceed if Trump is in the White House.In theTrump is facing four federal charges for undermining the 2020 election results, including conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.Trump has pleaded not guilty and insisted that the accusations were a political move. These charges, brought by special counsel Jack Smith, are currently on hold as Judge Tanya Chutkan determines the course of the case's proceedings in light of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.Theis among the four criminal cases brought against Trump. He was indicted last year on multiple counts, including retaining classified information and obstructing justice.In July, the classified documents case against him was dismissed after US District Judge Aileen Cannon sided with defense lawyers. They had argued that the special counsel, who filed the charges against Trump, was illegally appointed in the case by the US Justice Department.Days after this ruling, US District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Trump, citing that Attorney General Merrick Garland's appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was 'unconstitutional.'The question of whether Trump could pardon himself if re-elected remains legally challenging, as the US Constitution does not explicitly address self-pardon, and no president has ever attempted one.While some argue that a self-pardon would contradict fundamental legal principles, referencing a 1974 Department of Justice memo that says ""no one may be a judge in his own case,"" others believe the Constitution’s broad pardon power does not exclude self-pardons.If a president were to attempt a self-pardon, it would almost certainly lead to significant legal challenges and could ultimately require a Supreme Court ruling. Furthermore, presidential pardons apply only to federal offenses and would not impact any state-level charges, such as those Trump faces in Georgia.","Donald Trump is facing federal charges of mishandling classified documents and seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.

The oldest person to be elected US President at 78, Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution that a President can only hold the office twice. Unless of course he decides to become a dictator for more than just one day, a desire he has expressed, seemingly in jest. On a more serious note, Trump has said win or lose he will not run for office again, which means he will cede the Oval Office in 2028 when he will be 82.Typical of the American political system, analysts are already eyeing potential successors in 2028, with all eyes on incoming vice-president JD Vance, who is only 40, and will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the US government. The challenge for Vance to step into Trump formidable shoes will not only come from other aspirants in the party, but also from Trump's own proclivity to entrust his children, including his daughter Ivanka, 43, and sons Donald Trump Jr, 46, and Eric Trump, 40, with political responsibility. Vance’s Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri, will now be the official Second Lady of the United States.Beyond family and political succession though, the most influential member of the Trump II inner circle is expected to be Elon Musk, the Tesla/SpaceX honcho who threw his mouth and moolah behind the MAGA Supremo to counter the liberal leanings of the legacy media. Already assured of a key role in the TrumpII administration, Musk -- was embedded with the MAGA Supremo in Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on Tuesday night -- will be a lodestar in an incoming dispensation that has pledged to cull government departments and expenditure in the name of efficiency. Although Musk posted a meme showing him bringing a kitchen sink into the Oval Office as Trump’s victory became imminent, he cannot run for President because he is not a US born citizen. But beyond the man behind the Resolute Desk, he is expected to be the most influential figure in the Trump II dispensation.With the MAGA Supremo’s disdain for the Washington elite now well-established (resulting in at least 40 members of his cabinet and inner circle being fired or forced to resign), there will be plenty of new faces in Trump II White House, including those who unquestioningly stood by him or kissed his ring after being defeated by him. Among them Vivek Ramaswamy, 39, the Indian-American bio-science entrepreneur who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination but folded quickly to become a camp follower. Two other Indian-Americans, Kash Patel and Shalli Kumar, stood rock solid behind Trump through all his trials and tribulations, and they will be looking for the spoils of office too.Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN during Trump I, will also be looking to make a comeback after a late endorsement of Trump after critical comments about his campaign. Trump has also promised to let Robert Kennedy Jr, a man who has pushed crank science for decades, ""go wild"" with the health portfolio. Given that dozens of senior personnel in Trump I White House either resigned or were fired, there will be many new faces in Trump II, with everyone expected to toe the line in what will almost certainly be an imperial Presidency, a system endorsed by the US Supreme Court staffed by Trump during his first term.That will include the military commanders and the head of the US Federal Reserve and the Justice Department, who Trump expects to be pliable and follow the dictates of the White House. Having asserted that the President can do no wrong once – or anything he does is right since he has the mandate of the people once he is elected – Trump II is expected to be wild ride without guardrails.","Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution.

Former US President Donald Trump has emerged victorious in the crucial battleground state of Georgia, delivering a significant setback to his opponent, vice president Kamala Harris. This marks a notable shift in Georgia’s political landscape, as the state voted Democratic in the 2020 election, supporting Joe Biden over Trump by a slim margin.Trump's lead in Georgia stood at 52.9% of the vote to Harris’s 46.4%, with Edison Research reporting a preliminary 60.9% in Trump’s favour against Harris’s 38.6% based on 10.1% of votes counted earlier.Election day in Georgia, however, was marked by disruptions. Bomb threats at twelve polling locations led to extended voting hours, and two polling sites in Fulton County were briefly evacuated. The FBI traced some threats to foreign sources, including Russia. Despite these challenges, polling sites resumed operations after evacuations lasting around 30 minutes, and officials were able to continue the vote count with minimal interruption.US election results: Full coverage The state also saw high early voter turnout, particularly among women, who made up 56% of early voters. This trend highlighted the demographic’s continued engagement in Georgia’s tightly contested political landscape. However, some voters voiced concerns about apathy among certain demographics, specifically Black men, whom they felt were less likely to turn out for Harris.Adding to the election-day legal proceedings, a US judge dismissed a Republican lawsuit attempting to limit absentee ballots in seven Georgia counties, citing discrimination concerns.

According to the latest Associated Press tally, Trump stands at 277 electoral votes while Kamala Harris trails with 224. A win in any remaining battleground states—such as Alaska, Michigan, Arizona, or Nevada—would further solidify his path back to the White House.Trump achieved major gains by flipping key states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina, Wisconsin, all of which had voted Democratic in 2020.Kamala Harris, meanwhile, is facing an uphill battle. Although Harris won several Democratic strongholds, including Virginia and California, her campaign struggles to hold onto crucial votes, particularly in Black and Latino communities, where Trump's appeal has made inroads. Despite a loss of support in some demographics, Harris continues to focus on defending democracy, while Trump's campaign centers on issues like immigration and inflation.Trump's early success has also bolstered the Republican Party, which gained control of the Senate. The race remains tight, with Harris still hoping to pull off a late victory, but Trump’s momentum makes him the likely winner in this fierce battle for the White House.","Trump dominated in Alabama, securing its nine electoral votes in a landslide, reaffirming the state’s deep-rooted Republican leanings.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961506.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election.

The viral image, showing Alex alongside Democratic figures, emerged shortly after Trump’s triumphant announcement on Wednesday night, as he nears a historic comeback to the White House.The 38-year-old Alex Soros, known for his visible and vocal support of progressive causes, recently hosted Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Democratic vice-presidential candidate, in New York City. Soros shared a series of photos online, with the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop, describing the occasion as “an honour” on social media. This gathering coincided with the United Nations General Assembly, attracting global figures and adding visibility to Soros’ influence in political circles.Despite his father’s considerable legacy, Alex Soros has carved his own role within the Democratic sphere, leading the Open Society Foundations, a $25 billion philanthropic network dedicated to progressive initiatives. He frequently appears at high-profile Democratic events, such as the recent Democratic National Convention , where he mingled with prominent party figures, including former President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. He also attended with Huma Abedin, with whom he is reportedly engaged.Alex Soros has long been a key financial backer of the Democratic Party, donating over $720,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in 2020 and at least $5 million to Democratic causes since. Notably, he quickly endorsed Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick in 2020, urging fellow progressives to rally around her. Describing himself as “more political” than his father, Alex Soros has consistently defended his involvement, telling The Wall Street Journal, “As much as I would love to get money out of politics, as long as the other side is doing it, we will have to do it too.”With Trump claiming an unexpected victory over Kamala Harris, Republicans now see the Soros influence as a focal point for criticism, claiming that such political contributions fuel their “liberal agenda.” The Soros family has long been a target of Republican ire, particularly for supporting policies that challenge traditional law enforcement practices. George Soros has funded over 70 prosecutors across the US, advocating for reforms like reduced prosecution for non-violent crimes and adjustments to bail regulations—changes that Republicans argue have led to rising crime rates in certain areas.","Alex Soros, son of liberal billionaire George Soros, is known for his vocal support of progressive causes.

The presidential race between vice president Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump is tight. There is a parallel race among the pollsters as to who gets the closest to the actual outcome. Poll guru Nate Silver , who is a statistician, recently said the pollsters are fudging their numbers to predict a close race -- while the race is close, some of the predictions have it too close so that they don't have any face loss in case of either a Trump or a Kamala victory.Nate Silver's prediction all along was a toss-up race but in October he said his gut feeling is that Donald Trump will win.In a pole opposition position is American University professor Allan Lichtman who is called the Nostradamus of the US election as he correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential election. Lichtman says Kamala Harris would win the election.Their method is also different as Allan Lichtman does not rely on any polls but 13 keys and Kamala Harris was ahead of Trump. Silver and Lichtman fought over their methods as Silver said Lichtman's method was favoring Donald Trump but he was projecting a Kamala Harris win.Silver is a statistician and Lichtman is a historian and both of them have their record speaking for them. Lichtman predicted nine out of 10 last elections since 1984 except the 2000 presidential race between George W Bush and Al Gore. Nate Silver's model in 2008 forecast correctly the outcome of the presidential election in 49 out of 50 states. His model since then predicted the outcome correctly in 2012 and 2020.

US elections 2024: What will a Trump presidency mean for China?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-what-will-a-trump-presidency-mean-for-china/articleshow/115019757.cms,"( with input from agencies)

With the victory of Donald Trump over Kamala Harris, the world now awaits to see how the MAGA supremo will approach foreign affairs. For China, Trump's return to the White House promises an era marked by fierce competition and renewed unpredictability across trade, technology, and global influence.Donald Trump's campaign was rife with promises that sent a chill through China's economic corridors. His proposed tariffs exceeding 60% on Chinese imports threaten to severely impact the $400 billion annual trade between the two economic powerhouses.Robert Lighthizer, Trump's trade adviser, has been outspoken about pursuing ""strategic decoupling""—""that means significantly decreasing US dependence, US economic ties with China, compared to the derisking approach emphasised by the Biden administration,"" said Zhao Minghao was quoted as telling by news agency AP.New tariffs could be ""very challenging for Beijing given the economic difficulties in China,"" said Zhao professor at the Shanghai-based Fudan University.The return of Trump raises also expectations of stringent measures targeting China's technological sector. During his previous tenure, Trump's administration heavily scrutinised Chinese tech giants like Huawei, casting them as national security threats.Analysts like Zhao Minghao from Fudan University believe that while Beijing has already adjusted to Biden-era curbs, Trump's anticipated policies could present a more existential challenge. His administration's tactics could further complicate China's ambitions to lead in sectors like artificial intelligence and 5G, especially if restrictions extend to more components and tech partnerships.Trump's previous presidency was marked by high-stakes rhetoric, and his perspective on Beijing is already evident through his past statements.The president's consistent portrayal of China as an economic adversary—“We can't continue to allow China to rape our country”—underscores a confrontational stance that Beijing has come to expect. However, in the same breath, Trump has maintained a complex relationship with President Xi Jinping, often praising his leadership even while holding him accountable for controversial policies and actions.China's concerns extend beyond trade and tech; they lie in security and strategic positioning. Trump's unpredictable nature and strong rhetoric have previously stoked fears of heightened tensions in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. While Trump is unlikely to push for direct military conflict. During his first term, Trump's interactions with Taipei broke longstanding protocol, and another tenure could see further escalations that Beijing views as crossing red lines.While Trump’s strategy aims to protect American industries and reduce deficits, the knock-on effects could lead to inflationary pressures in the US and strained consumer markets worldwide, experts were quoted as telling news agency AP. China, meanwhile, may double down on efforts to bolster self-sufficiency, invest in new trade partnerships, and strengthen its Belt and Road Initiative as a countermeasure to US economic aggression.Experts quoted by AP, including Henry Huiyao Wang of the Center for China and Globalization argue that China’s approach will likely remain strategically consistent regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. However, Beijing's focus may shift toward managing fallout, securing trade routes, and strengthening ties with Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa to counterbalance US restrictions.Whether through tough tariffs, tech blacklists, or diplomatic negotiations, the US-China relationship will continue to be a defining feature of his tenure, with profound implications for global politics and economic stability. ""Regardless who is elected, the structural tensions are an undeniable reality and have become a widely accepted bipartisan consensus within the US,"" said Henry Huiyao Wang of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank.",Donald Trump's campaign was rife with promises that sent a chill through China's economic corridors.

As the US presidential race reaches its climax, all eyes were on seven fiercely contested states poised to define the outcome.With both candidates, former President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, fighting for the White House, each swing state victory became a crucial piece in the puzzle to reach the necessary 270 electoral votes.Donald Trump secured victory in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and is leading in Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.These seven states, five of which Trump carried in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020, have once again proved pivotal.In Georgia, Donald Trump reclaimed victory, capturing the state’s 16 electoral votes and restoring it to the Republican column. After a narrow Biden win in 2020, Trump’s Georgia comeback illustrated the state's enduring Republican inclination, despite its recent shifts.Georgia became a battleground over Trump’s 2020 attempts to contest his loss here, a move that led to his indictment. Even though the state has two Democratic US senators, this election underscored its deep-seated conservative leanings.North Carolina emerged as another victory for Trump, as he successfully defended this swing state from Kamala Harris’s strong attempts to flip it. In the campaign's final days, Trump visited North Carolina multiple times, underscoring its importance. Despite Democrats’ substantial investments and Harris’s energetic door-to-door outreach, Trump’s continued popularity thwarted the Democratic push, marking another win for the former president and securing his electoral path.Donald Trump emerged victorious in Pennsylvania, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in one of the most closely watched battleground states of the election. Both candidates poured significant time and resources into Pennsylvania, making it a central focus of their campaigns, AP reported.Trump's win in the state secured him its 19 electoral votes, flipping the state back to the Republican column after it had been won by Joe Biden four years earlier, helping the Democrats break the GOP's grip on the ""blue wall."" Since 1948, no Democrat has won the presidency without taking Pennsylvania, underscoring its critical role in the outcome of the election.As 93% of Nevada’s votes were counted, Trump led Harris with 53.5% to her 46.1%, according to Edison Research. Known for its diverse population, Nevada has more registered nonpartisan voters than those affiliated with the two major parties, making it a challenging yet strategic battleground. In recent elections, Democrats have won here by diminishing margins, and this trend appeared to benefit Trump as he retained a strong lead.With around 51% of the vote counted, Arizona showed Trump narrowly ahead of Harris, with 940,508 votes compared to her 921,341. Arizona, which Biden narrowly won by 10,457 votes in 2020, has once again become a tight race. This desert battleground, marked by shifting demographics and changing political tides, remained a hotly contested arena in the 2024 election.Michigan, once part of the Democrats' “blue wall,” saw Trump leading with 68% of the votes counted. According to the Associated Press, he held 2,114,151 votes, or 52.3%, compared to Harris's 1,862,416. Although Michigan was essential to Harris’s electoral strategy, Trump’s strong polling underscored the state’s shifting loyalties. Michigan, where Trump won by 155,000 votes in 2020, was again proving its importance in the Republican path to victory.Former President Donald Trump claimed a crucial victory in Wisconsin, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in this key battleground state and securing its 10 Electoral College votes. Trump previously won Wisconsin by a narrow margin in 2016, becoming the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to carry the state, though he lost it to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.This election cycle, both Harris and Trump prioritized Wisconsin in their campaigns. In 2020, Trump unsuccessfully attempted to overturn his loss in the state through lawsuits and recounts. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 5:34am ET.","Donald Trump secured victory in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and is leading in Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.

LUDHIANA: It only took Rs 65,000 to hire men for carrying out the two Molotov cocktail (petrol bomb) attacks at the residences of two right-wing Hindu outfit leaders in Punjab on Oct 16 and then on Nov 2, police investigation has revealed.The money, which was to be distributed between the attackers, was transferred to four bank accounts operated by the acquaintances of accused Ravinderpal Singh alias Ravi of Rahon area in Nawanshahr. Ludhiana police have now approached the banks concerned to get the details of the transactions.Police are also probing if more Hindu leaders were on the target of the accused. The Ludhiana counter-intelligence wing of Punjab Police and Ludhiana commissionerate police, in a joint operation, on Tuesday arrested four accused involved in the petrol bomb attacks at the houses of Shiv Sena (Bharat Vanshi) Yogesh Bakhshi on Oct 16 and Harkirant Singh Khurana of Shiv Sena (Hind) on Nov 2.Apart from Ravi (38), police had arrested Jaswinder Singh alias Binder of Boothgarh village of Ludhiana, and Manish Sahid alias Sanju (30) and Anil Kumar alias Honey (27), both residents of Rahon. Their accomplice Lovpreet Singh alias Monu Baba, resident of Nawanshahr, is yet to be arrested. Police have also seized two mobile phones and impounded a red-coloured TVS Raider motorcycle used to execute the crimes.Police had also said that the attack was masterminded by Europe-based handlers of Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), Harjit Singh Laddi and Sabi. Manish is also accused of involvement in the killing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Vikas Prabhakar in Nangal. He had allegedly arranged shooters for the murder.An official of Ludhiana police said their probe found Ravi had received about Rs 65,000 in four bank accounts from the main accused. “These four bank accounts are of acquaintances of Ravi. Police have got the details of the bank accounts and have asked the banks concerned to share details of the accounts from which the money was transferred,” the official added.The official said this money was to be distributed among all accused.Asked if Manish was involved in this bank transaction, knowing the fact he was in direct link with BKI handler Sabi, the official said, “Though Manish was long as sociated with Sabi, Ravi had talked to Laddi over a call a few days before the first attack. Since then, Ravi was in direct contact with Laddi. Therefore, money was also transferred into the bank accounts provided by Rav.”The official said the police were questioning the accused to find if more leaders were on their hit-list.Police said Ravi, Anil and Jaswinder are the ones who had lobbed a petrol bomb at the house of Yogesh Bakshi in Haibowal, while at Harikrat Khurana’s house, the bomb was hurled by Ravi, Anil and Lovepreet. Police said the accused only wanted to threaten the leaders. Police said Lovepreet Singh had been living at adera in Nawanshahr and is addressed as Monu Baba by people. He has escaped from the dera and is being tracked.Ludhiana commissioner of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal said provocative content posted by leaders on social media accounts was the reason for the attack. “People are advised to refrain from posting provocative content. Anyone found involved in hate speech would face action,” he said.Four persons have been arrested by the Ludhiana Counter Intelligence and Ludhiana city police in connection with a Molotov cocktail (petrol bomb) attack targeting two leaders of Hindu organizations. One suspect remains at large.","The money, which was to be distributed between the attackers, was transferred to four bank accounts operated by the acquaintances of accused Ravinderpal Singh alias Ravi.

"""If it comes, it comes"": 49ers' Nick Bosa is not much worried about the potential fine after MAGA hat appearance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/if-it-comes-it-comes-49ers-nick-bosa-is-not-much-worried-about-the-potential-fine-after-maga-hat-appearance/articleshow/115036635.cms,"Credit: AP Photos

Nick Bosa says MAGA hat on TV was ""Well Worth It""



Nick Bosa, the star defensive end for the San Francisco 49ers, recently made headlines for his post-game celebration after a win over the Dallas Cowboys. In an act of political expression, Bosa wore a "" Make America Great Again "" hat and crashed an NBC post-game interview. While Bosa's actions have sparked controversy and a potential league fine, he remains unrepentant. He has openly acknowledged the risk of disciplinary action but insists that his political beliefs are paramount.Also Read: Drake Maye reveals ‘Biggest’ weakness after being dubbed ‘Trade Deadline Loser’ due to Patriots’ mistake The hat was displayed prominently as Bosa interrupted NBC’s postgame interview with his teammates, quarterback Brock Purdy, tight end George Kittle, and running back Isaac Guerendo. Despite the possible repercussions, Bosa has openly stated that he has no regrets, even if the action ultimately leads to a fine.Bosa clarified that he has yet to face any financial penalty from the NFL for his display. In a statement given to the media on Wednesday, he noted, “But if it comes, it comes,” underscoring his acceptance of any potential consequences. This announcement followed the recent re-election of former President Donald Trump, who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, marking his return to the White House. Bosa’s appearance with the MAGA hat came only a day after the election results, an event he followed closely, as he revealed, “It was fun... Stayed up.”NFL rules strictly prohibit players from wearing or displaying personal messages, particularly those that could be seen on game days or in postgame interviews. These guidelines state that any visible, unapproved messages—whether in writing or illustration—are grounds for fines. The policy, established in the league’s collective bargaining agreement, specifies that first-time violators could face a fine of up to $11,255. NFL vice president of communications, Brian McCarthy, responded to inquiries by stating that the league is currently evaluating the incident but provided “no update” on potential disciplinary action against Bosa.Despite the possibility of a penalty, Bosa has shown no intention of moderating his political stance or public support for Trump. When asked if he would continue to express his political views, Bosa remained resolute, explaining that he didn’t expect his position to waver post-election, adding, “Clearly, the nation spoke, and we got what we got.”The NFL’s review of the incident, as reported by CBS Sports’ Jonathan Jones, suggests that the league is treating the matter seriously, although no suspension is being considered. For Bosa, however, any fine resulting from his choice seems inconsequential. ""Yeah, it was well worth it,” he commented confidently, displaying his readiness to stand by his beliefs, regardless of the cost.Also Read: Cowboys legend calls for Mike McCarthy’s firing, urges Jerry Jones to ""Steal"" commanders’ coach for HC role","Nick Bosa, the star defensive end for the San Francisco 49ers, recently made headlines for his post-game celebration after a win over the Dallas Cowboys.

Former US President Barack Obama on Wednesday congratulated Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance following their election victory and highlighted the importance of upholding democratic values and the peaceful transition of power.""This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for,"" Obama said.

Bibi's firing of Israel defence chief draws both ire & praise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/bibis-firing-of-israel-defence-chief-draws-both-ire-praise/articleshow/115032167.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's shock firing of his defence chief on Tuesday night removed a cabinet critic, but also deepened anger among opponents about his handling of the country's multi-front conflict. In Yoav Gallant , Netanyahu had a defence minister who challenged many of his plans for the war against Hamas in Gaza and threatened the stability of his fragile coalition. Netanyahu said the trust between him and Gallant had broken down.Gallant, who spoke regularly with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and helped Israel and the US weather tensions between Netanyahu and Biden, cited three reasons for being fired. One of them, he said, was to do with the conduct of war in Gaza. Gallant long said the best way to get the hostages released was to accept a phased ceasefire even if it meant withdrawing from parts of Gaza.Another reason was growing divisions over a recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned Orthodox Jews' exemption from military conscription. Gallant said the ruling had to be implemented, while Netanyahu and his Orthodox political allies wanted to bypass it.In recent days, Netanyahu failed to introduce a policy allowing Orthodox men, known as Haredim, to avoid economic sanctions if they refused to serve. Haredi parties, key coalition members, have threatened to topple the government if that doesn't happen.The third point of contention between Gallant and Netanyahu was over the former's call for a commission of inquiry ""to uncover the truth and learn lessons"" about Oct 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, triggering the war. It was the worst day in Israel's history in terms of the number of Israelis killed. Netanyahu says a state inquiry would be a distraction while the conflict continues.For all that Gallant's departure may stabilise Netanyahu's coalition, it weakens him in other ways. Opponents - including a business forum containing CEOs of some of Israel's biggest companies - cried foul and said he was prioritising his political survival over the nation's security and hostages. Protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, though they couldn't persuade Netanyahu to change his mind. ""Lawlessness,"" read a headline in Yediot Aharonot, Israel's largest newspaper on Wednesday. ""This is how democracy dies,"" wrote the paper's main columnist, Nahum Barnea.On Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed at least 38 people around the eastern city of Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, according to the regional governor, and at dusk more strikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs. The attack happened shortly after Hezbollah secretary general Naim Qassem said he did not believe ""political action"" would bring about an end to hostilities.Lebanon renewed its call for a ceasefire and submitted a new complaint to the UN Security Council regarding Israel's attacks on the country. The escalating Israeli attacks against Lebanon have turned into ""crimes"" against humanity, Lebanese PM Najib Mikati said.",Yoav Gallant challenged many of Netanyahu's plans for the war against Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu said the trust between him and Gallant had broken down.
