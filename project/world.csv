Evidence against man, who spent 12 yrs in jail, fabricated by police: SC

NEW DELHI: Time and again cases surface where the accused are made ""scapegoats"" by the system and false evidence planted against them. These victims end up rotting in jail for years even if they eventually get acquitted. Now, Supreme Court has decided to examine the complex matter of compensating a person for wrongful arrest, prosecution and conviction.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta Monday sought assistance from the attorney general and solicitor general to adjudicate the issue which will have major implications, given that conviction rate in the country is just around 54%.Appearing for one such accused, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium said people who have to spend years in jail over false charges must be compensated after being acquitted, as the incarceration amounts to violation of fundamental rights. He pleaded with the court to frame guidelines on the issue. Law Commission too had recommended a statutory framework for the purpose, he said.The court was hearing the plea of a poor person who had to spend 12 years in jail, out of which six were under the shadow of death after he was awarded capital punishment for the rape and murder of a minor. The man was acquitted by SC, which held that the evidence against him was fabricated by police.Assisted by Square Circle Clinic of NALSAR, Hyderabad, he moved SC through advocates Mihir Samson and Yash S Vijay for compensation in lieu of what he had endured. He was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to death in 2019 by a trial court in Thane. His acquittal by SC came in 2025.""The petitioner has suffered a grave and severe violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, on account of being falsely accused of heinous offences, illegally arrested, being made the subject of an illegal and tainted investigation, unfair prosecution, and suffering 12 years of wrongful incarceration, for which he ought to be appropriately compensated by the state as it has completely destroyed his life, his reputation and his family, with the latter reduced to abject penury. ..,"" the petition said.Functionaries of the state were responsible for his arrest, prosecution and conviction. It is well settled that the state must be responsible for the wrongdoing of its servants in the harm caused to the fundamental rights of citizens, by way of appropriate compensation. This responsibility is on the basis of strict liability. The mere release of the individual from incarceration is not sufficient to correct the wrongs faced by him, and the state ought to be directed to pay appropriate compensation to him for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage he suffered for 12 years and continues to suffer,"" the petition stated. As two other petitions have also been filed by aggrieved persons, the court clubbed all three cases together. In 2018, the Law Commission had recommended enacting a specific legal provision for redress in cases of miscarriage of justice.","Supreme Court to examine the complex matter of compensating a person for wrongful arrest, prosecution and conviction.

MP BJP expels functionary after farmer's murder in Guna

BHOPAL: A land dispute turned murderous in a village in MP's Guna district Sunday when a BJP functionary allegedly led a mob that bludgeoned a 50-year-old with iron rods, broke his limbs, crushed him under an MUV, and molested his daughter who tried to shield him from the attackers.Police said around 15 armed men attacked the farmer and his wife while they were on their way to their field in Ganeshpura village. When his two daughters rushed to help, the accused, identified as BJP's local booth committee chief Mahendra Nagar, allegedly pinned one of them to the ground, sat on her chest, and tore her clothes.The mob allegedly fired guns and threatened villagers to prevent anyone from taking the victim to the hospital.Within an hour, the wounded farmer died.""There were multiple fractures on the farmer's body. His daughters were also attacked,"" SDOP Bamori Vivek Asthana said Monday. ""An FIR has been registered against 14 people.""Those named include BJP's local booth committee chief Mahendra Nagar, his brother Hukum Singh Nagar, wife Kamlesh Bai, and sons Nitesh and Devendra Nagar. Hukum Singh has been arrested. Others are on the run.Police said the assault stemmed from a long-standing land dispute between the farmer and Nagar's relative Kanhaiya Nagar over a plot in Rajasthan's Baran district.One of the victim's daughters said: ""I tried to save my father. But they pushed me to the ground. Mahendra Nagar sat on me and tore my clothes. They fired their guns and pulled me by the hair. My father was going to the field when all these people - Mahendra, Naveen, Harish, Gautam, Devendra - came out and attacked him.""The killing ignited political outrage and calls for the expulsion of Nagar - a former Congress worker who joined BJP in 2020 after Jyotiraditya Scindia's defection. He has been charged with murder, molestation, and criminal conspiracy under BNS. State BJP president Hemant Khandelwal expelled Nagar from the party Monday evening. Guna BJP president Dharmendra Sikarwar said earlier in the day that a letter has been sent to party seniors seeking his immediate removal. ""We have asked for his expulsion from the post and from primary membership,"" he said.","MP BJP expels functionary after farmer's murder in Guna district. 15 armed men attacked the farmer and his wife while they were on their way to their field.

Bengaluru Doctor Arrested For Allegedly Killing Wife With Anesthesia Overdose Months After Wedding

How footage from CCTV cam foiled bid to pass off murder as fire accident





NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old woman, her ex-boyfriend and his friend have been arrested for allegedly killing her live-in partner, a UPSC aspirant, in north Delhi's Timarpur earlier this month and staging it as a fire incident.According to police, she planned the murder as she suspected he possessed a hard disk containing ""objectionable"" videos and photographs of her.The accused - Amrita Chauhan, her ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap (27) and his friend Sandeep Kumar (29) - hail from UP's Moradabad, where they were nabbed.On Oct 6, police were alerted to a fire on a fourth-floor flat in Gandhi Vihar. Firefighters found a charred body inside, later identified as 32-year-old Ramkesh Meena. A case under sections related to causing death by negligence was registered at the time.CCTV footage showed two masked persons entering the building on the day of the incident. After 39 minutes, one person could be seen exiting, and at 2.57am, a woman with another individual left the premises. The fire broke out shortly afterward, raising suspicion.According to sources, the woman's identity was established and her phone's location found near the site of the incident. When police tried to contact her, it was switched off. Several raids in Moradabad led to her arrest on Oct 18. Cops said she confessed to the crime and revealed the involvement of Kashyap and Kumar as well as the motive. Police recovered the hard disk, a trolley bag and the victim's shirt.Kashyap and Kumar were subsequently arrested on Oct 22 and 23, respectively. Police later invoked BNS sections related to murder, common intention, and mischief by injury, inundation, fire or explosive substance against the trio.Police said an inquiry revealed Chauhan and Meena, who met in May this year, had a live-in relationship. ""She claimed he secretly recorded obscene videos and refused to delete them,"" an officer said.When she shared her grievance with Kashyap, he allegedly roped in his friend to retrieve the hard disk. Chauhan, a BSc Forensic Science student and an avid watcher of crime series, hatched the plan to murder Meena and make it seem as though he died in a fire, police said.The trio allegedly thrashed and strangled Meena, before pouring oil, ghee and wine over his body. Kashyap placed a gas cylinder near the victim's head, opened the regulator and ignited it with a lighter while Chauhan secured the flat's iron gate from the inside, said police. They allegedly stole the hard disk, two laptops and other items belonging to Meena. About an hour later, the cylinder exploded, completely burning the victim.Confirming the arrests, DCP (North) Raja Banthia said Kashyap worked as an LPG distributor while Kumar was a graduate preparing for SSC CGL exams.","A 21-year-old woman, her ex-boyfriend and his friend have been arrested for allegedly killing her live-in partner, a UPSC aspirant, in north Delhi.

NEW DELHI: What began as an alleged acid attack near Delhi University’s Laxmi Bai College has turned into a case of deceit and revenge. The Delhi Police on Monday arrested Akil Khan, the father of the 20-year-old student who had claimed to be the victim of the acid attack, after uncovering that Khan had allegedly raped the wife of the main accused in the supposed acid attack. However, Khan has now admitted that the acid attack was fabricated using nothing more than toilet cleaner.During interrogation, Akil Khan admitted to fabricating the acid attack claim, saying that the liquid used was ordinary toilet cleaner, news agency PTI reported.According to police, the student, a second-year BCom candidate enrolled in DU’s Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board, had claimed that she was attacked with acid by Jitender and his associates, Ishan and Arman, on Sunday morning while on her way to attend an extra class.Soon after, counterclaims surfaced, including an accusation of rape against the student’s father. The wife of the main accused, Jitender Singh, told police that she had earlier filed a complaint against the student’s father, Akil Khan, alleging that Akil had raped her while she was employed at his socks manufacturing unit between 2021 and 2024. She said Khan had blackmailed her using her private photos and videos.Following her statement, police questioned Khan when he admitted to fabricating the acid attack claim.Investigators had already found inconsistencies in the student’s account and confirmed that Jitender was not present at the alleged crime scene at the time of the incident. Call detail records and CCTV footage revealed that he and his wife were in Karol Bagh, far from the area of the incident.","Akil Khan, the father of the 20-year-old student who had claimed to be the victim of the acid attack, was arrested on Monday.

The Chhath countdown



NEW DELHI: When Rahul Gandhi set out under Bihar 's unforgiving August sun for his 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', it was a test of whether he could still find takers in a land where the Congress survives mostly as a fading afterimage. For 16 days, his campaign carved a noisy trail through dusty highways and crowded colonies.Today, however, as Bihar's election heat rises and the state readies for a two-phase assembly poll, the buzz is dominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fiery speeches, Amit Shah's rallies, Tejashwi Yadav's roadshows and Prashant Kishor's groundwork. Amid all this, one voice remains missing - Rahul Gandhi.The Congress leaders's last appearance in Bihar was nearly two months ago, when he wrapped up his yatra at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on September 1. The campaign was pitched as a moral crusade to ""protect the vote"" - an attempt to awaken Bihar's electorate against what he called 'vote chori' (theft of votes) by the ruling NDA.Over sixteen days, he covered 1,300 km across 25 districts and 110 assembly constituencies - riding motorbikes, donning 'gamcha' for local appeal, visiting makhana farmers - often joined by allies like Tejashwi Yadav, Hemant Soren and others.But two months later, the narrative has shifted. Rahul, who had briefly stirred Congress's dormant base through his yatra, seems to have lost the momentum. And instead of leading the charge from the front, its leader is missing in action.When the Mahagathbandhan announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate on October 23, the press conference banner carried only one face - Tejashwi's. Rahul was missing, both on stage and in spirit. Within the alliance, the unspoken verdict seemed clear: he may be the face of opposition on the national level, but he was no longer its in-charge in Bihar.Though there has been no official seat-sharing arrangement, RJD is contesting 143 of the 243 seats of Bihar and Congress is contesting 61 seats.In the 2020 assembly elections, Congress had the worst strike rate in the opposition camp despite Tejashwi's electrifying campaign that led RJD to emerge as the largest single party. Congress had contested 70 seats, the most in the opposition alliance after the RJD (144), and could win only 19.Since his Patna rally, Rahul Gandhi has appeared in public only five times - none of them in Bihar. In late September, he was spotted at a pizza outlet in Gurugram.In early October, he travelled to Colombia, where he declared that ""India’s democratic system is under attack from all sides."" During a talk at the University of Chile, he lamented that ""free and scientific thinking"" was under ""tremendous attack"" in India.On October 17, he visited singer Zubeen Garg’s village in Assam to pay tributes. Three days later, he was seen at a sweet shop in Old Delhi, rolling laddoos for the cameras.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal, however, maintained that the party's ""full-throttle campaign"" will begin only after the Chhath festival. Rahul Gandhi, he said, will tour Bihar on October 29 and 30, followed by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and party president Mallikarjun Kharge. A joint rally with Tejashwi is planned in Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.But will this late entry work? For the past month, while PM Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda have flooded Bihar with rallies and Tejashwi has built emotional momentum across districts, Congress has remained in political limbo.Rahul's absence has left party candidates and workers scrambling for visibility and credibility on the ground. His re-entry, barely a week before Phase 1 polling on November 6, feels less like a strategy and more like irrelevance.For now, Congress is trying to make up for his absence by circulating old clips from the yatra, calling Rahul Gandhi the 'Jan Nayak' — the ""hero of the people.""Adding to the drift is Congress's own internal turmoil in Bihar.Ticket distribution had triggered open rebellion, with state leaders accusing AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru of corruption and favouritism. Disgruntled members were seen protesting at the party headquarters. Their slogan, ""Ticket chor, gaddi chhodd,"" was an ironic echo of Rahul's own ""Vote chor, gaddi chhodd"" taunt at the NDA government.The dissent underscores the deep disconnect between the central leadership and the local cadre, even at the last leg of the election campaign. In recent days, senior leaders like Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel were parachuted in to manage the fallout, both within the party and with allies like RJD. Hemant Soren, who walked with Rahul in Bihar in a show of strength, eventually walked out and decided not to contest elections.But through it all, Rahul has remained absent.Meanwhile, BJP has turned Bihar into a campaign battlefield.Prime Minister Modi has led from the front with rallies in Samastipur and Begusarai, urging voters to deliver a ""record-breaking victory."" Home minister Amit Shah has addressed meetings in Siwan and Buxar, while BJP president JP Nadda has courted intellectuals in Vaishali. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been roped in to hold over 20 rallies.The optics are unmistakable, a full-spectrum show of power and coordination.Rahul's partner, Tejashwi Yadav, has also been a relentless presence on the ground, addressing multiple rallies a day. When asked about Rahul’s absence, he sidesteps diplomatically, but the contract remains too stark to miss.Even after literally no presence till now, Congress insists that its campaign will finally shift gears after Chhath Puja (October 27). The party’s manifesto, focusing on social justice and women's welfare, is scheduled for release on October 28.He is scheduled to address his first political rally along with Tejashwi Yadav on October 29. The duo will hold a joint rally in Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.His late entry may well be planned. But ask any political pundit and they will tell you that in any election, presence on the ground matters the most, and right now, that is nowhere to be seen.So, just 10 days before Bihar goes to the first phase of polling, the question is simple: Why so late, Rahul?","Rahul Gandhi's last appearance in Bihar was nearly two months ago, when he wrapped up his yatra at Patna's Gandhi Maidan.

NEW DELHI: A day after a 20-year-old Delhi University student was allegedly attacked with acid near Laxmi Bai College in Delhi, the case has taken a confusing turn with conflicting evidence, past complaints and a possible revenge angle now under probe.Police sources told news agency PTI that the prime suspect, Jitender, was miles away from the crime scene when the alleged attack took place.

Investigators are also questioning why the victim got off her e-rickshaw about 300 metres short of her college gate, after travelling part of the way on a scooter with her brother.In a separate development, Jitender's wife has accused the victim's father of rape, filing a complaint at the Bhalswa Dairy Police Station.She alleged that while working at a socks factory owned by the man since 2021, he took private photographs of her, sexually assaulted her, and later circulated the images to her husband.Police confirmed she had made prior PCR calls on October 24 and 25, but a written complaint was only filed now.Investigators have also learned that two other men named in the current case, Ishan and Arman, are distant relatives of the victim. Their families have reportedly been locked in a long-standing property dispute.In 2018, their mother had accused the victim's father of throwing acid at her, and a case was registered at Mangolpuri Police Station.Police are now examining multiple possible motives, including revenge, family enmity and attempted framing, as the investigation continues.","A 20-year-old Delhi University student was allegedly attacked with acid near Laxmi Bai College in Delhi.

Cyclone Montha: Army, NDRF On Alert As Twin Cyclonic Systems Build Up In Arabian Sea & Bay Of Bengal

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has been placed on high alert as two developing cyclonic systems over the East Central Arabian Sea and the South East Bay of Bengal are expected to intensify into cyclone “Montha” within the next 48 hours.According to a statement cited by ANI, the Army said the situation is being closely monitored in coordination with the national disaster management authority (NDMA) and respective state governments.“The Indian Army has been placed on high alert in view of the developing cyclonic systems over both the East Central Arabian Sea and the South East Bay of Bengal, which are expected to intensify over the next 48 hours into Cyclone ‘Montha’.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: SC Monday said hurling a shoe at an SC judge in courtroom is criminal contempt in the face of the court but expressed reluctance to initiate contempt proceedings against advocate Rakesh Kishore, who engaged in the act against CJI BR Gavai, saying the judge who faced the attempted assault alone could punish the contemnor.SC Bar Association chief and senior advocate Vikas Singh repeatedly requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi to entertain association's plea seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore.""His subsequent conduct is even more contemptuous as, instead of being remorseful, he boasted he would do it again and that it was a command from God. This is an insult to God as no God would give such a command,"" Singh said.Justices Kant and Bagchi said that under Contempt of Court Act, 1971, only the judge before whom anyone attempts or commits contempt in the face of the court has jurisdiction to initiate contempt proceedings in matter.""The act of the advocate is a serious and grave criminal contempt of court. His subsequent conduct aggravates his crime. But once the CJI has magnanimously pardoned him, there is little we can do. We also do not think the attorney general can give consent for initiation of contempt proceedings in a case involving criminal contempt in the face of the court,"" the bench said.Justice Kant pointed out that initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore would only serve his design of getting cheap publicity on social media. ""He should be treated with the contempt he deserves for the abominable action,"" the bench said, though adding that it was ready to consider the larger issue at hand - the issuance of a John Doe order restraining social media from glorifying such incidents.

NEW DELHI: EC's decision to launch a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls from Nov triggered sharp political reactions across states, with Bengal's Trinamool Congress and Tamil Nadu's DMK alleging a ""BJP-backed plot"" to delete legitimate voters, while the saffron party hailed it as a ""cleansing exercise to weed out illegal ones"".TMC would ""democratically protest"" any attempt to strike out genuine voters, party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said Monday. ""We have no problem with electoral roll revision, but if anyone tries to delete the name of any eligible voter at BJP's behest, we will protest democratically,"" he said, urging people not to fall into ""BJP's trap"".Bengal minister for women and child development Shashi Panja called the revision ""unnecessary and hurried"". ""If 2024 voter list was correct, why change now? SIR is nothing but a backdoor entry for NRC,"" she said, adding that ""whenever we ask a question to EC, it's BJP that replies"".Bengal BJP welcomed the exercise as essential to purging electoral lists of ""illegal voters"". State opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari said, ""No illegal voters will be spared. Legitimate voters have nothing to fear. But infiltrators who form TMC's vote bank will be weeded out.""State BJP chief Samik Bhattacharya added, ""If anyone tries to stall the process, custodians of the Constitution will take care of it. CM (Mamata Banerjee) herself had flagged illegal immigration in Parliament in 2004. EC is only cleansing the rolls. Our aim is to detect and delete - deportation will come later.""Bengal Congress president Subhankar Sarkar called the SIR rollout ""faulty"" and ""imposed without consultation"". ""We presented a detailed memorandum to EC based on our experience with SIR in Bihar, but they did not accept any proposal. The timing too is insensitive, coming amid Chhath and Jagaddhatri Puja,"" he said.CPM Bengal secretary M Salim said, ""If a single genuine voter's name is deleted, we will oppose. Amit Shah himself said 'detect, delete and deport'. Our workers will stay vigilant.""In Chennai, CM MK Stalin held an emergency meeting with DMK allies soon after EC's announcement and called for an all-party meeting on Nov 2 to devise a joint response. ""Right to vote is the foundation of democracy. Tamil Nadu will fight against any attempt to murder it - and Tamil Nadu will win,"" Stalin wrote on X. He termed the revision ""a conspiracy by EC to rob citizens of their rights and help BJP,"" citing Bihar experience where, he alleged, ""large numbers of women, minorities and SC/ST voters were removed from rolls"".Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda pledged to resist ""wrongful deletion of names"". ""Questions have been raised about independence of EC. Congress will not allow deletion of even a single genuine voter,"" he said.","EC's decision to launch a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls from Nov triggered sharp political reactions across states.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over stray dog bite incidents continuing despite its directions, Supreme Court on Monday summoned chief secretaries of all states and UTs - except Bengal and Telangana - for failing to inform it about steps taken to implement the Animal Birth Control rules.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria took strong exception to states not responding to its notice or filing compliance affidavits in the two months since its Aug 22 order. ""Continuous incidents are happening and the country's image is going down in the eyes of foreign nations. We also read news reports,"" the bench said. The apex court directed the chief secretaries to appear before it on Nov 3 and explain the non-compliance.Noting that the rules are uniform nationwide and the menace of dog bites exists in every state, SC had earlier expanded the scope of the case beyond Delhi-NCR and issued notices to all states and UTs. It had sought details from animal husbandry and local body departments on the compliance measures.At Monday's hearing, SC was informed that only Bengal, Telangana and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had filed responses. Rejecting some states' claims that notices were not served, the bench said its order had been widely reported and warned of punitive action for further lapses. ""Your clients don't read newspapers? Everyone reported this,"" it remarked.On Aug 22, SC had stayed an order to permanently remove stray dogs but allowed sterilisation, inoculation and deworming drives, and restricted feeding of strays to designated spots.","Supreme Court summons chief secretaries of all states and UTs - except Bengal and Telangana.

JAMMU: BSF troops on Monday found over 5.3kg of heroin dropped from a suspected Pakistani drone in Jammu’s RS Pura sector. Officials said the contraband was worth over Rs 25 crore in the international market.The drugs were spotted during a search on a farm in Bidipur village based on intelligence inputs. “BSF troops personnel found two yellow-coloured packets, containing 10 small packets wrapped in them. These appeared to have been drone-dropped from across the border,” a BSF official said.According to the official, the seizure marked another abortive attempt by Pakistan-based smugglers to push narcotics into Indian territory. “A thorough search of the area is still going on. BSF remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard our borders and nation from all threats,” the official said.Last month, police in Jammu’s Kathua had busted an inter-state narcotics syndicate involved in selling narcotics smuggled through Pakistani drones, arresting four suspects from J&K and Punjab.Among those arrested were Sukhwinder Singh of Amritsar and Arshdeep Singh of Gurdaspur in Punjab.The two were employees in a highway project in Samba. They allegedly picked up drugs dropped from Pakistani drones and acted as couriers.Sukhwinder and Arshdeep were caught with 411gm of heroin. Based on their disclosures, Feroz Din, a Kathua trafficker who was in touch with Pakistan-based smugglers, was also arrested.The trio’s interrogation led the cops to the kingpin of the racket in Tarn Taran, Punjab. Police said he paid for the Pakistan-sourced drugs through hawala channels.","The drugs were spotted during a search on a farm in Bidipur village.

SRINAGAR: J&K government has sought permission from NIA to carry out ground surveys and technical studies for the proposed 1.4km gondola project in Pahalgam, where a terrorist attack on April 22 left 26 people dead, including 25 tourists and a local pony operator.The attack in Baisaran — a popular meadow above Pahalgam — forced the closure of the area and rattled visitor confidence in one of the region’s top resort towns. Keen to help tourism rebound, govt has pushed to restart the halted cable car project that promises to boost footfall and economic activity in south Kashmir’s hill circuit.CM Omar Abdullah said in a written reply in the assembly Monday that J&K Cable Car Corporation (JKCCC) had finalised alignment for the gondola — from near Yatri Niwas to Baisaran — before work stalled after the terrorist attack. “The total length of the project will be 1.4km,” Abdullah said.The CM said govt is also exploring the installation of a ski drag lift at nearby Aru valley using existing foundations to promote winter tourism in the area.He said over 9 hectares of forest land are required for the Pahalgam project — estimated to cost Rs 120 crore, including land compensation, to be funded from JKCCC’s own resources. Tenders for consultancy and DPR preparation have been awarded and a formal agreement signed, but site work has remained on hold pending security clearance.“The agency has now sought permission to visit the site for topographical and geo-technical studies. The matter was taken up with the Anantnag DC, who advised approaching NIA. The corporation has accordingly written to NIA and work will begin immediately after permission is granted,” the CM said. Once approvals are in place, construction is expected to be completed within 18 months.","J&K government has sought permission from NIA to carry out ground surveys and technical studies for the proposed 1.4km gondola project in Pahalgam.

Even today, Parliament closes each session with an instrumental version rather than a vocal rendition.Modi also recalled how the song's first public rendition was by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 session of Congress. ""Vande Mataram was composed 150 years ago, and in 1896, Tagore sang it for the first time,"" he said.Modi also paid tribute to Komaram Bheem - the tribal leader who spearheaded the Gond rebellion against the British and feudal Nizams of Hyderabad in 1928 - as well as tribal icon and freedom fighter Birsa Munda ahead of his birth anniversary on Nov 15, celebrated as 'Janajateeya Gaurav Diwas'.

World’s 9 weakest passports in 2025: Countries with the least travel freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/destinations/worlds-9-weakest-passports-in-2025-countries-with-the-least-travel-freedom/articleshow/124721967.cms,"Afghanistan (Rank 104, Score 25)

A passport is an important travel document for those who wish to explore other countries. It allows people international travel freedom. But the ranking of passports also matters. If a country’s passport is strong, the residents can often travel visa free or visa-on-arrival facilities to several nations. But when a country’s passport is weak, it only creates issues in obtaining a visa and also lacks several other powers that come along with strong passports.The rankings are reflection of much deeper and larger issues including political instability, limited diplomatic influence and international relations. These are prime reasons restricting travel freedom for citizens of the affected countries.According to the latest (2025) Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries. On this note, let’s have a look at 9 weakest passports in the world.Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.Afghan nationals can enter only 25 countries without a visa. This restricted travel freedom stems primarily from ongoing conflict, political instability, and limited diplomatic influence. For the majority of international destinations, Afghan travelers face lengthy and often uncertain visa application procedures, significantly limiting their global mobility.Syria ranks second on the list, largely due to prolonged civil conflict and political instability. Only a handful of countries allow Syrians visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry, while most impose strict entry requirements. Security concerns remain the primary reason behind such limited travel access for Syrian passport holders.Iraq’s passport also offers limited visa-free access. It is because of political instability, security issues, and the country’s changing diplomatic relationships. Iraqi passport holders commonly need to apply for visas in advance.Pakistan’s passport ranks low primarily due to ongoing political instability, security concerns, and strained cross-border relations. Citizens frequently face lengthy and complex visa procedures, with a relatively high rate of application rejections compared to many other countries.Yemen has a bad security situation, the state of the country is greatly affected by political instability. The passport has limited reach, leaving many destinations off-limits. Humanitarian crises are also there. Outside travel requires careful planning and prior approvals.Somalia’s passport is affected by long-standing political instability. There are security challenges too and a limited diplomatic network. Many countries need Somalis to obtain visas before travel. Progress in governance and expanded bilateral relations is needed.Nepal’s low rank reflects a passport that Nepalis still require visas for many popular destinations. They might enjoy easier travel within South Asia and some neighboring countries, but long-haul travel involves advance visa applications.Palestinian territories also face a lot of issues. There are diplomatic and recognition issues. Passport holders require lengthy full visa processing. Geopolitical constraints and limited state recognition continue to restrict the mobility of many Palestinians.Libya’s passport has slightly higher access, yet remains burdened by political instability and security issues. Libyans frequently face prior-visa requirements and unpredictable processing times. Any sustained improvements in political stability and international relations would likely be the principal route to expand Libyan citizens’ travel freedoms.These nine weak passports of the countries only reflect how security concerns, political instability, cross border tensions, and diplomatic relationships directly affect not only international but everyday freedom to travel. It’s a difficult travel situation for the citizens of these nine nations. With lengthy visa processes and no surety of obtaining one, international mobility is often a matter of careful planning and several official approvals. It also limits work options, education, or family visits abroad, and personal opportunities too.Ultimately, a passport is more than a travel document - it’s a reflection of a nation’s global standing and stability. As countries work toward peace, stronger governance, and better diplomatic ties, their citizens may someday gain the freedom to move across borders with greater ease and dignity, enjoying broader opportunities and a true sense of global belonging.","According to the latest Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries.

Battle For New York City: Is Zohran Mamdani New Hope For Democrats Against Trump? | Global Pulse





Two prominent MAGA Republican lawmakers have formally demanded the US Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate putative New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, whose mother is the Indian filmmaker Mira Nair, with the explicit goal of revoking his American citizenship and triggering deportation proceedings.Florida Congressman Randy Fine this week joined his GOP colleague Andy Ogles of Tennessee in seeking a Justice Department review into Mamdani’s 2018 naturalization, citing among other things, failure to disclose membership in the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which they deem as a communist organization, on his citizenship application.They also say Mamdani’s past public remarks and associations with radical groups raise questions about potential ties to entities that might have been viewed as “totalitarian” or “anti-American” under the laws governing naturalization.Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani, now 31, arrived in the U.S. at age 7 and became a citizen in 2018. He is vying to become the first Muslim mayor of New York – a city with the biggest Jewish population outside Israel – in an election that has attracted both national and global attention. Polls show Mamdani leading the November 4 election by double-digit margins in a race even President Trump – who branded him a ""100% Communist Lunatic"" on Truth Social – has conceded.While Mamdani’s meteoric rise had triggered MAGA Republicans, it has also split the Indian-American community, with some conservative groups accusing him of “victimhood politics,” hostility towards Prime Minister Modi, and making statements that they say are insensitive towards Hindu traditions, and progressive groups backing him.In a separate development, the New York Post on Monday reported that ""China-owned"" TikTok allegedly manipulated its platform's algorithm to disproportionately feed New York residents pro-Mamdani videos, bringing into the election another “foreign hand” angle. More U.S lawmakers jumped into the fray with Texas Senator Ted Cruz snarkily asking on X, “Now why would the CCP want a commie jihadist as mayor of NYC?”“Comrade Mamdani is the future of the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party is now explicitly and unapologetically communist and jihadist,” Cruz said in a separate post as MAGA Republicans fumed at the prospect of the crown jewel among American cities being governed by an Indian-origin Muslim immigrant who became a naturalized US citizen less than a decade ago.While President Trump and administration mandarins have not entertained calls from MAGA hardliners to denaturalize Mamdani, legal experts say stripping a naturalized citizen of US citizenship, while possible if citizenship was obtained through ""willful misrepresentation,"" is very rare given the high burden of proof. They also caution that targeting political speech and affiliations, such as the disputed interpretation of the DSA as a ""communist organization"" or rap lyrics as ""material support"" to terrorism – one of MAGA allegations against Mamdani – would face strong First Amendment protections in court.Mamdani has dismissed the accusations as ""racist bullshit,"" underscoring his nearly three decades in the US and his campaign’s focus on affordability and working-class issues that have electrified what is arguably the world’s most diverse city, with more than 35 per cent of its population foreign-born.","Zohran Mamdani, 31, is vying to become the first Muslim mayor of New York. He arrived in the U.S. at age 7 and became a citizen in 2018. Florida Congressman Randy Fine this week joined his GOP colleague Andy Ogles of Tennessee in seeking a Justice Department review into his 2018 naturalization.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124854155,imgsize-894133,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-67.jpg"

'Drugged' Sikh Truck Driver Behind Fiery Crash in California Reignites Illegal Immigration Debate

A petition has been started demanding the return of Jashanpreet Singh's turban.





21-year-old truck driver Jashanpreet Singh's recent appearance in the court on charges of vehicular manslaughter under the influence in California shocked his family members and the Sikh community as Singh was seen without a turban. A petition has now been started demanding the return of his turban immediately, as snatching his turban is a violation of his Sikh identity. Jashanpreet pleaded not guilty to all the charges -- three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug. His family in India said he's a baptized Sikh and hence does not do drugs.Jashanpreet is now in jail and will appear in court next on November 4. Court documents revealed that he would need a Punjabi interpreter in his next court appearance.The administration called Jashanpreet Singh an illegal alien though Singh had Employment Authorization Documents valid up to 2030 and a commercial driver's license to operate the truck he was driving.Calling his treatment in the US disrespectful to the Sikhs, many social media users asked whether he would still remain an asylum seeker in the US despite the treatment he's receiving there.The Change.org petition demanding the return of Jashanpreet's turban said Singh had been wrongfully accused by media outlets of drug use, tarnishing his reputation. The petition said that there has been no concrete evidence supporting his drug use but that made the headlines while he is an 'Amritdhari Sikh'.""The presumption of innocence until proven guilty, a foundational principle of justice, has been blatantly disregarded. In this climate of misinformation and prejudice, Jashanpreet has also been stripped of his turban—a deeply significant symbol of his faith and identity. This act is not only an infringement on his personal beliefs but an assault on our entire community's cultural and religious values,"" the petition said.""We are calling upon the judicial system to reconsider Jashanpreet's case with fairness and empathy, taking into account his clean history and the lack of evidence against him. The sentence he received is disproportionate and does not reflect the reality of his situation. We urge the authorities to return Jashanpreet’s turban to him immediately, respecting his rights and dignity as a Sikh,"" it said.",A petition has been started demanding the return of Jashanpreet Singh's turban.

NEW DELHI: The investigation into the alleged acid attack on a 19-year-old DU student has taken anew twist. Police have arrested the girl’s father, Akil Khan, for allegedly sexually assaulting the wife of one of the suspects the girl claimed was stalking her.“He (Akil Khan) confessed to fabricating the acid attack story because the woman had filed a complaint against him, and he wanted to implicate her husband in the acid attack case,” the police said.Police revealed that two days before the alleged attack, the wife of the suspect made a PCR call accusing the girl’s father of harassment and blackmail.“She alleged that while working in his factory between 2021 and 2024, he sexually harassed her, forced physical relations, and blackmailed her with objectionable photos and videos. Sleuths also found that there is an old property dispute between the mother of the other two suspects and relatives of the girl’s father.Moreover, police found several contradictions in the girl complainant’s account and confirmed that none of the accused she named were present at the location at the time of the incident.Police suspect that the girl may have burnt her hands by using a toilet-cleaning liquid, but they are waiting for the medical report for confirmation.According to police, the alleged acid attack incident was reported at 10.52 am on Sunday, when the girl, on her way to college, claimed that three men attacked her with acid. She alleged that one of the attackers was stalking her for the past year. Thereafter, a case was registered.However, during the investigation, several inconsistencies surfaced in her version.","Police have arrested the girl’s father, Akil Khan, for allegedly sexually assaulting the wife of one of the suspects the girl claimed was stalking her. “He (Akil Khan) confessed to fabricating the acid attack story because the woman had filed a complaint against him, and he wanted to implicate her husband,” police said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124861665,imgsize-37260,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/police-revealed-that-two-days-before-the-alleged-attack-the-wife-of-the-suspect-made-a-pcr-call-accusing-the-girls-father-of-harassment-and-blackmail.jpg"

He has also been implicated in the murder of Vasudev Israni in Jodhpur’s Sardarpura and known to be involved in extortion and firearm-related crimes abroad.The AGTF is now working on expediting Jagga's deportation to India to face charges against him. “The operation underscores our commitment to pursuing criminals relentlessly, regardless of geographical boundaries,” Dinesh MN told TOI .","Jagdeep Singh, alias Jagga, a prominent member of the notorious Lawrence Bishnoi gang, was detained near the US-Canada border.

US former President Barack Obama was reportedly not at all pleased when Nancy Pelosi endorsed ex-Vice President Kamala Harris less than a day after Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.According to ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl’s upcoming book Retribution, Obama phoned the former House Speaker soon after her statement went public to express his frustration, believing they had agreed to hold off and “let a process play out” to determine the Democratic nominee.“The Obamas were not happy,” a Pelosi confidant told Karl, who added that one person summed up Obama’s reaction as, “What the f–k did you just do?”Pelosi had praised Harris as “brilliantly astute” and declared her full confidence in the former California senator’s ability to beat Donald Trump, breaking an informal understanding between two of the party’s most powerful figures, as per New York Post.Karl writes that both Obama and Pelosi had privately agreed that Harris should not be handed the nomination unchallenged — especially given the former president’s concerns about her electability. But once Biden himself threw his support behind Harris, Pelosi told Obama, “That train has left the station.”Despite reports of tension, sources close to both Democrats described the exchange as more “good-natured ribbing” than an outright confrontation — though Pelosi’s camp said Obama sounded “genuinely irritated.”The book also notes that Obama waited five days after Biden’s withdrawal to endorse Harris, while Pelosi did so in under 24 hours, effectively solidifying Harris’s position as the presumptive nominee.Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, was reportedly surprised by her decision.“Kamala?” he asked, to which Pelosi snapped back, “Don’t start with me.”Ultimately, Karl suggests Pelosi felt boxed in as major Democratic figures — from Bill and Hillary Clinton to governors Josh Shapiro and Gavin Newsom — lined up behind Harris almost immediately.“No other candidates had stepped forward,” Karl writes. “Kamala Harris was it — the only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win.”",Former President Barack Obama was reportedly not happy when Nancy Pelosi endorsed ex-Vice President Kamala Harris less than a day after Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.

A protester on Monday confronted King Charles outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, questioning him about Prince Andrew's connections to Jeffrey Epstein while the monarch was greeting royal supporters. The incident occurred amid renewed scrutiny of the royal family's knowledge of Andrew's ties to the late sex offender.The heckler directly challenged the King, shouting: ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?""The protest comes as Prince Andrew, 65, recently announced he would stop using his Duke of York title following years of controversy over his association with Epstein.The protester also questioned potential police involvement, calling out: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? Should the MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""The King continued engaging with other members of the public, ignoring the protestor's remarks.Recent developments have intensified public interest in the matter, including the contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had accused Prince Andrew of sexual abuse when she was a teenager.Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's allegations. He reached an undisclosed settlement in 2022 to resolve a US lawsuit filed by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.British law enforcement is currently investigating media reports that Andrew requested a police officer to gather compromising information about Giuffre in 2011.The renewed attention to the case has kept the royal family under public scrutiny, despite Andrew's recent decision to distance himself from his royal title.","Protester confronted King Charles outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England.

Track and timing



Strength and intensification



Impacts so far & risks ahead



In Jamaica, authorities imposed mandatory evacuations for parts of the southern coast including Port Royal and activated emergency funding of at least US $33 million.



Prior to reaching Jamaica, Melissa triggered heavy rainfall across Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with confirmed deaths and large-scale evacuations.

Forecasters expect rainfall totals of up to 40 inches (≈1 m) in portions of Jamaica, and storm surge peaking near 13 feet (4 m) along the southern coast.



Mountainous regions are especially vulnerable: the combination of heavy rain, steep slopes and deforested terrain raises landslide danger



Preparation and warnings



Climate context







Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 5 system and the strongest storm anywhere in the world this year, is barreling toward Jamaica with sustained winds nearing 280 km/h, threatening catastrophic flooding, landslides and coastal storm surges across the Caribbean. The US national hurricane center (NHC) said the storm, which underwent explosive intensification over the weekend, has become a “potentially catastrophic” cyclone as it inches closer to the island’s southern coastline.By late Monday, Melissa was located roughly 200 km south-southwest of Kingston, moving slowly westward at about 5 kilometres per hour - a sluggish pace that forecasters warn will amplify rainfall and prolong destructive winds over Jamaica and neighbouring islands. The system has already lashed parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, leaving several dead and thousands displaced, according to the AP.Meteorologists describe Melissa as the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, drawing strength from exceptionally warm ocean waters - nearly 2-3 °C above average - and calm upper-level winds that have allowed it to rapidly intensify. Authorities in Jamaica have ordered evacuations along low-lying southern areas, shuttered airports, and urged residents to brace for what Prime Minister Andrew Holness called a “historic and life-threatening event.Melissa is forecast to cross Jamaica late early Tuesday, then advance toward eastern Cuba on Tuesday night and reach the Bahamas by Wednesday.At the latest advisory, the storm was located roughly 205 km south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, moving westward at about 6 km/h. The slow pace is a key factor in the threat, it increases the duration of exposure to high winds and heavy rain, and allows flooding and landslides to build. Experts say Melissa’s rapid escalation to Category 5 was driven by unusually warm Atlantic waters and favourable atmospheric conditions.According to the NHC and other meteorologists, the storm may now rank among the most powerful ever to enter the Caribbean Sea, with sustained winds around 175 mph. The NHC issued stark warnings: “Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely today through Tuesday.” Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica emphasised: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5.”Transport Minister Daryl Vaz urged residents: “Don’t make foolish decisions… We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.”Shelters have been opened and airports closed. Still, concerns linger about looting, inability to evacuate remote communities and potential delays in aid due to cut-off roads and communication loss. Meteorologists say storms like Melissa are emblematic of a warming world: ocean temperatures in the relevant zone are about 2-3 °C above average, creating a “vast reservoir of energy” for hurricane intensification.“It doesn’t mean every single cyclone will go through rapid or super-rapid intensification,” noted climate scientist Bernadette Woods Placky, “but in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid or super-rapid intensification.”(With inputs from agecies)","Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 5 system, is barreling toward Jamaica with sustained winds nearing 280 km/h.

Karoline Leavitt Calls Indian Trucker Illegal Alien After Deadly California Road Accident Kill Three





US transportation secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he is about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver's licenses to non-citizens.In an appearance on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Duffy said governor Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with department of transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued. His statement came after investigations into two recent fatal crashes involving Sikh drivers showed widespread malpractice in issuance of commercial driving licences (CDLs).""So, one, I'm about to pull $160 million from California,"" Duffy said. ""And, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California's ability to issue commercial driver's licenses.""Eva Spiegel, a spokesperson for California's department of motor vehicles, said the Trump administration ""has no legitimate basis"" to withhold federal highway transportation funds. ""The federal govt previously allowed commercial driver's licences for asylum seekers and refugees and on Sept 26 announced emergency regulations to cease this practice that went into effect on Sept 29.California is in compliance with these regulations and will remain in compliance with federal law. ""When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and that of Texas, which is the only state with more licenced commercial drivers.Duffy said California has unlawfully issued tens of thousands of these licences to non-citizens.

I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

BIG! Trump To ABANDON 100% Tariffs On China’s Goods Ahead Of Historic Meet With Xi Jinping





Optimism grew Monday that US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping will end their bruising trade war during talks this week, as the US president touched down in Tokyo on the latest leg of an Asian tour.Trump said en route to close US ally Japan that he was hopeful of a deal when he sees Xi on Thursday, while also indicating he was willing to extend his trip in order to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I have a lot of respect for President Xi and we are going to I think... come away with a deal,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One, adding that he aimed to go to China ""in the earlier part"" of 2026. The optimism boosted stock markets, with Japan's Nikkei surpassing 50,000 points for the first time.As dozens of people gathered at Haneda Airport to take photos, the presidential plane - also bearing secretary of state Marco Rubio and treasury secretary Scott Bessent - landed at sunset.Sporting a golden tie, Trump boarded a helicopter to take him into the bright lights of the Japanese metropolis in time for an evening audience with the emperor.

Before Trump's arrival in Malaysia, Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng held two days of trade talks, seeking an agreement to avoid additional 100% tariffs due from Nov 1.

A motorcyclist accused of fatally shooting a San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy was captured Monday after crashing into another vehicle during a high-speed chase on the 210 Freeway near Ontario.Authorities say the suspect was wanted in connection with a possible domestic violence incident in Rancho Cucamonga. When deputies responded around 1.30 pm (US time), one of them — identified as Deputy Andrew Nunez — was shot and killed, Fox news reported.The gunman fled the scene on a motorcycle, reaching triple-digit speeds and reportedly riding against oncoming traffic multiple times along the 210 Freeway. About five minutes later, the suspect collided with a car on the eastbound lanes near exit 56 in Ontario.Footage from SkyFOX showed the suspect sitting upright in a neck brace, surrounded by law enforcement before being placed on a gurney and airlifted to a hospital. A firearm was visible on the roadway near the crash site.Earlier, a large police presence was seen at an apartment complex on the 12300 block of Hollycock in Rancho Cucamonga — the initial scene of the shooting — where a bloody vest and a patrol vehicle with a shattered window were spotted.The suspect’s condition remains unclear. Officials have not yet released details about his injuries or identity. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.","Authorities say the suspect was wanted in connection with a possible domestic violence incident in Rancho Cucamonga.

President's ‘Too Cute’ Attack On Dems, Leaves Door Open For 3rd Term

Can Trump again run for President?

Can Trump amend the 22nd Amendment?

Has any president ever served more than two terms?





US President Donald Trump on Monday ruled out running for vice president in the 2028 election — but notably stopped short of ruling out a third term, fueling speculation about how he might try to extend his time in office.Trump, 79, has repeatedly teased the idea of serving beyond the constitutionally limited two terms, joking at rallies and even selling “Trump 2028” hats. While most constitutional scholars have dismissed such talk as legally impossible, some of his allies have suggested exploring “creative” ways to make it happen.Under the 22nd Amendment, no one can be elected president more than twice. Some Trump supporters have floated a loophole — that he could run as vice president and then assume office if the elected president resigned. But Trump appeared to reject that idea when speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during his flight from Malaysia to Tokyo.“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said. “But I wouldn’t. I think it’s too cute. The people wouldn’t like that. It wouldn’t be right.”Still, Trump left the door open to a future run. Asked whether he was ruling out a third term, he replied, “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever,” adding when pressed, “Am I not ruling it out? You’ll have to tell me.”President Donald Trump has hinted several times that he’d like to extend his stay in the White House — even joking about serving beyond the traditional limit. But could he actually run again in 2028 and seek a third term?The short answer: No. The Constitution bars anyone from being elected president more than twice.The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, clearly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”Kimberly Wehle, a constitutional law professor at the University of Baltimore and author of ""How to Read the Constitution and Why,"" said the amendment leaves no room for ambiguity. “There was a concern about entrenching power in a kinglike manner,” she explained to New York Times.Amending the Constitution would be an extraordinarily difficult task. A proposed amendment requires approval from two-thirds of both the House and Senate — a far higher threshold than the narrow Republican majorities currently in place — or from two-thirds of state legislatures calling for a constitutional convention.Even then, ratification demands support from three-fourths of all state legislatures or constitutional conventions.Just three days after President Trump was sworn in for his second term, Representative Andy Ogles, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced a long-shot proposal to amend the Constitution and open a path for a potential third term.His resolution stated: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms.”Ogles argued that Trump needed more time to fulfill his agenda and undo the policies of the Biden administration, saying, “He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation’s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal.”Yes — Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four consecutive terms, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. His presidency spanned the Great Depression and World War II, a period of immense national crisis that made his continued leadership broadly acceptable at the time.There was no 22nd Amendment then, but Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term tenure became the catalyst for introducing formal presidential term limits.“Four terms, or 16 years, is the most dangerous threat to our freedom ever proposed,” warned Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor who ran against Roosevelt in 1944 and later lost to Harry S. Truman in 1948.",President Donald Trump has hinted several times that he’d like to extend his stay in the White House. But could he actually run again in 2028 and seek a third term?

SNAP benefits to end on November 1; air traffic controllers to miss first paychecks — will Trump and Democrats strike a deal to end shutdown?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-snap-benefits-to-end-on-november-1-air-traffic-controllers-to-miss-first-paychecks/articleshow/124861067.cms,"

Will Medicare and Medicaid be affected by the government shutdown?

US shutdown affects air travel

Will lawmakers make peace for Americans





As the US government shutdown drags into its fourth week, millions of Americans are facing the threat of losing food assistance, and air traffic controllers are preparing to miss their first paychecks.The Department of Agriculture says Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will stop on November 1, warning that “the well has run dry, ABC news reported.SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, provides support to about 42 million low-income Americans. The program is federally funded but administered by states, meaning the shutdown’s effects will vary across the country.For now, beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid should still be able to access medical care without disruption. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) confirmed that both programs will continue operating during the shutdown, with Medicaid funding secured through the end of the year, US Today reported.However, experts caution that prolonged gridlock could cause ripple effects. If the shutdown stretches on, doctors, hospitals, and other health providers may begin to experience delays in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid — potentially straining operations and patient services over time.Air travel chaos worsened across the US on Monday as the government shutdown entered its 27th day, with more than 5,600 flights delayed nationwide amid a surge in air traffic controller absences.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) blamed staffing shortages for widespread disruptions, implementing ground delay programs at Newark Liberty International in New Jersey, Austin-Bergstrom in Texas, and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Earlier in the day, flights in the Southeast were also affected by shortages at the Atlanta Terminal Radar Approach Control.Around 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers have been working without pay since the shutdown began, after a funding standoff between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats, as per Reuters.Officials have warned that delays and cancellations could worsen as air traffic controllers miss their first full paycheck on Tuesday. On Sunday alone, more than 8,800 flights were delayed nationwide.Secretary of transport department Sean Duffy said that air traffic controllers will stop getting paid starting October 28.In a post on X, he said, ""Air traffic controllers will stop getting paid starting TOMORROW. This is not ok! I just visited several of them at @goingplacesCLE and they are worried about paying their mortgage. @SenSchumer and @RepJeffriesyou’ve got to do better!""As the shutdown continues to impact Americans and key deadlines loom, all eyes are on Capitol Hill where lawmakers are still in a stalemate.And it seems that President Donald Trump and Democrats are in the negotiating terms, according to the ABC news.Over the weekend, the Trump administration said it will not extend additional funding for SNAP, blaming Democrats for the continued stalemate. The position marks a reversal from a contingency plan published by USDA in September, which suggested that multi-year funds could sustain operations during a shutdown.Democrats are blasting President Donald Trump for refusing to tap into contingency funds to keep food aid flowing during the government shutdown.In a joint statement Friday, Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Angie Craig called the move “perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offense the Trump administration has perpetrated yet.”They also accused Trump of misplaced priorities — pointing to his decision to provide financial assistance to Argentina and fund a new White House ballroom even as millions of Americans face losing access to food assistance.","USDA says food stamps will stop on November 1, warning that ""the well has run dry"" More than 5,600 flights were delayed nationwide on Monday as the government shutdown entered its 27th day.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump’s ‘DEMENTIA SYMPTOMS’ AWKWARDLY VISIBLE During Japan Visit?

Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

Chants of “tax the rich” were heard through the crowd. This showed a clear rift within the Democratic Party between moderates and progressives.X users flooded Musk’s replies, with MAGA supporters accusing Mamdani of “pushing communist ideology” and others viewing Musk’s post as an ironic endorsement.

Aleena Asif, an Indian-origin woman, was killed by her estranged husband, Asif Qureshi, in Long Island over their ongoing marital dispute. Asif Qureshi was arraigned in a Long Island courtroom Friday, a week after Aleena Asif's body was found asphyxiated with chemical burns to the face at her home in Herricks. Aleena and Qureshi were parents to three children. While Aleena is originally from Mumbai, Qureshi is from Pakistan but a US citizen.Nassau County Police nabbed the husband after he was seen sneaking into the wife's home wearing a mask, hoodie and gloves, hiding and waiting for his wife to return from walking their seven-year-old child to school. As she returned, he attacked her with a chemical mixture, which was a cyanide-like compound. Then Qureshi got away on an e-bike and fled the crime scene.Aleena's 18-year-old daughter raised an alarm and called 911 when she didn't pick up her 7-year-old sister from school. The medical examiner determined she died of asphyxiation by an unknown chemical substance, police said. The incident was ruled a homicide.Police said Aleena tried to leave Qureshi and served him with divorce papers. Qureshi did not accept the papers and started stalking her, showing up at her house.Once, he threatened Aleena that he would make her swallow bleach. Aleena, an accountant, called law enforcement four times with safety concerns.Qureshi, an unemployed software engineer, pleaded not guilty to the second-degree murder charge. His attorney called him a good US citizen and provider for his family.According to reports, Qureshi had been arrested before for a 'domestic incident' with Asif, and also had five prior incidents - four with his wife and one with a daughter.","Aleena Asif, an Indian-origin woman, was killed by her estranged husband, Asif Qureshi, in Long Island over their ongoing marital dispute.

3. Sentencing scheduled (October 2025)

4. Sentence imposed (3 October 2025)

5. Forecasted release (8 May 2028)

Sean “Diddy” Combs is set to walk out of prison on 8 May 2028, according to the Bureau of Prisons website, following his sentencing for two federal prostitution-related convictions.He is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn, where he has remained since his arrest in September 2024.55-year-old Combs was taken into federal custody following an indictment on charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. A judge denied bail, ruling that “detention is mandatory” given allegations of abuse, violence and risk to the community.On July 2, 2025, a jury found Combs guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but cleared him of sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The convictions carried potential sentences of up to 10 years each.Combs’ sentencing date was set for October 3, 2025, after both defence and prosecution agreed. He remained in custody pending the hearing.On that date, Indian-origin judge Arun Subramanian sentenced Combs to four years and two months (50 months) in prison.He also ordered a $500,000 fine and five years of supervised release. The judge acknowledged Combs’ achievements but said a “substantial sentence must be given to send a message to abusers and victims alike.”With his 50-month sentence in place and credit for time already served in detention since September 2024, Combs’ release date is projected to be May 8, 2028. During his term, he may be transferred to a different facility.Combs will serve his time amid ongoing civil lawsuits against him, while his team may pursue appeals or other legal motions. Prosecutors had recommended more than 11 years behind bars, citing his “extensive history of abuse and violence.” His defence argued he should receive no more than 14 months, pointing to the time he had already spent in custody.","Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is set to walk out of prison on 8 May 2028, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.
