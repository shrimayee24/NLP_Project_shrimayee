52C at Mecca: 13 Keralite haj pilgrims among 922 dead

Minister Abdurahiman reports 13 Keralites died in scorching temperatures during Mecca pilgrimage, demanding Centre's intervention to solve problems faced by pilgrims. He addresses Union ministers and Consulate General about pilgrims' difficulties in Saudi Arabia, including complaints about negligence in activities of mutawwifs and poor accommodation in Assisi.

HYDERABAD: With limited buses to ferry them, many Haj pilgrims said that they had to walk for over 40km, even as temperatures touched 52 degree Celsius.Speaking over phone from Saudi Arabia, Hyderabad resident Md Fareed told TOI that many pilgrims had developed blisters on their feet, were running high temperature , suffered sunstroke, and fainted mid-way owing to the scorching heat .“The lack of buses only compounded the problem. We walked for over 7.5 km to reach Arafat from Mina,” said Fareed, adding, “I got blisters on my feet and my wife fainted as we walked for over 40km during the pilgrimage .”The Musheerabad resident is among the 300 who have completed their Haj and are waiting to board flights back to their home country this weekend.Many pilgrims from Telangana said that they had to wait for 8 to 10 hours for buses to arrive. “The main problem was with transportation. Hundreds of pilgrims from the city had to wait for hours to get a bus. Many even fainted during the wait,” said one of the 41 khadims, who travelled from Hyderabad to assist Hajis.He also claimed that they had to walk for long hours without food and water. “As a result, many pilgrims, especially those who are diabetic and have blood pressure issues, suffered during their pilgrimage,” he added.While Telangana State Haj Committee officials agreed to lack of amenities on day 1, they said that they were resolved subsequently. “There was an issue with food and accommodation initially as most of the buildings are used only during Haj. It took us about 18 hours to get them resolved. Moreover, many had to wait for over eight hours to board a bus to perform Haj,” said Shaik Liyakat Hussain, CEO, Haj Committee.Officials said the problem with transportation arose as the contract this time was given to two agencies instead of one like every year. “Also, the buses were getting stuck in traffic as lakhs of pilgrims were at Haj,” the official added.","Saudi health official Jameel Abualenain reported no abnormal deaths during Haj.

Renukaswamy murder case: Loafers Darshan kicked his fan with found in wife’s flat; clothes seized,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/renukaswamy-murder-case-loafers-darshan-kicked-his-fan-withfound-in-wifes-flat-clothes-seized/articleshow/111098565.cms,"Given to Vijayalakshmi

BENGALURU: In a midnight operation , police probing the Renukaswamy murder case retrieved Sandalwood actor Darshan's loafers, allegedly used in the crime, from his wife Vijayalakshmi 's flat at Hoskerehalli in south Bengaluru.Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , and his aides, on June 8. On Saturday, police had sought extension of the accused's custody, saying they had to seize Darshan's clothes and shoes as they were crucial evidence.Police initially thought that Darshan's clothes and footwear could be found either in his house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar or at Pavithra's residence in Kenchenahalli. They had not factored in the possibility of any of this material ending up in the house of the actor's wife, with whom his ties are said to be anything but cordial.According to sources, Darshan told his interrogators that he had kept the clothes and footwear he was wearing on the day of the crime in his RR Nagar residence. Police were hoping to find Renukaswamy's bloodstains on it.A team of police and FSL officials took Darshan and his aide Pavan K to his residence at Ideal Township in RR Nagar at 11.15pm Saturday. Darshan's employee Babul Khan opened the door. As informed by Darshan, police rummaged through a plastic bin on the first floor, but in vain. Darshan and Khan told them that there are possibilities that the domestic help might have taken the clothes for washing to the terrace. The blue jeans trousers of True Religion brand and a black round-neck T-shirt of Opium Valley brand, which the actor was wearing on the day of the crime, were found on the terrace.When asked about his footwear, Darshan took them to the ground floor and showed them a cupboard near the sitting room. But the loafers weren't there.Sources said Pavan told police that the footwear may have been taken to Mysuru by Darshan's costume assistant Raju when he went for shooting. Police contacted Raju over phone at 12.56am and went near his house in Attiguppe. He informed police that he had given a few clothes, shoes and other valuables of Darshan to his wife Vijayalakshmi. Police immediately contacted Vijayalakshmi, who replied that there were a few shoes of her husband at her home.According to sources, Vijayalakshmi asked police not to visit her flat as it was past midnight and she had a minor son at home. She informed police that she would bring all of Darshan's shoes near the apartment security room and they could check them there.Officials rushed to the Hosakerehalli apartment with Darshan. When police personnel reached the security room, Vijayalakshmi had kept a few shoes and other footwear there. Darshan identified the blue loafers he had worn that day. FSL officials seized them.Police commissioner B Dayananda told media that his team is working hard to ensure justice is delivered to the victim's family.","Renukaswamy was beaten to death, allegedly by Darshan, his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda, and his aides, on June 8.

There was trauma but the child ( juvenile in conflict with law) was also in trauma, give him some time,"" said Justices Bharti Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande of Bombay high court while hearing a plea against his ""illegal detention"" following ""public pressure"".The teen was allegedly speeding with the high-end luxury set of wheels in Pune in an intoxicated state on May 19, when the car crashed into a bike, killing two software engineers, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta.HC on Friday closed for orders a habeas corpus petition filed by a Delhi-based paternal aunt of the minor. She sought his release from an alleged illegal detention, three days after being released on bail. Last Friday, HC had declined urgent relief on the plea.Senior counsel Aabad Ponda for the family said the actions of the state acting under alleged public pressure raised significant questions . He said the court has to consider whether a child who is released on bail and continues to be on bail could be remanded to an observation home , contending there was an express prohibition in the Juvenile Justice Act to do so.HC on Friday asked the police under which legal provision had the teen been sent back to the observation home after his release on bail.State public prosecutor H S Venegaonkar opposed the plea, saying it was not maintainable as the minor is detained under a court order and is in an observation home, not jail.""Can this be done without re-arrest or having bail cancelled?"" asked Ponda. He added, ""Does Section 104 of JJ Act permit review or only amendment? Is Section 39 (2) of JJ Act not an express bar to sending a person on bail to an observation home?"" He went on to question, ""If there are errors in bail order, is it not to be appealed in a higher forum and not reviewed by the same court is 104 without any power under that section of review?""On May 19, a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) granted the boy bail. It directed him to write a 300-word essay on road safety as bail conditions. Police sought to appeal and on May 22, JJB remanded him to a children's observation home.HC asked orally, ""What kind of remand is this?""""Is this not confinement ?"" HC added, questioning why the police did not apply for bail cancellation.Ponda said a citizen's liberty has been ""trampled upon"". Venegaonkar said the JJB order was valid as instead of his parents, the boy was now under the care of a probation officer.HC will pass orders on June 25. Till then, the teen has been remanded to the observation home in Pune.","HC on Friday closed for orders a habeas corpus petition filed by a Delhi-based paternal aunt.

"Teen's dad, 5 representatives of 2 pubs get bail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/teens-dad-5-representatives-of-2-pubs-get-bail/articleshow/111176155.cms,"PUNE: A special court on Friday granted bail to the father of the 17-year-old involved in the Porsche Taycan crash at Kalyaninagar, and five representatives of two pubs in a case under the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act.Two software engineers were killed after the car hit their motorcycle from behind around 2.30am on May 19. The teenage driver was returning home after partying with friends — first at Cosie pub and later at Blak Marriott pub , both in Mundhwa.The teenager’s father, a city-based builder, was booked for giving the car to the minor despite knowing that the latter had no driving licence and was not trained to drive it. The owner and a manager of Cosie and two staffers and a consultant with Blak Marriot were booked for serving liquor to minors, including the teenage driver. “The court has granted bail to all the six applicants. We are yet to get a full text of the court’s order,” special public prosecutor Vidya Vibhute told TOI.The builder’s lawyer, Prashant Patil, and lawyers S Jain, Amol Dange, Sudhir Shah and Shreyas Kulkarni, representing the other applicants, also confirmed the development and said their clients had been directed to furnish personal bonds of Rs50,000 each with a surety of the like amount to secure their release.However, the teenager’s father is unlikely to walk out of Yerawada jail soon as the JJ Act case is different from the main accident case in which the teenager is the prime accused while his parents, two doctors and a then mortuary staffer at Sassoon hospital , and two middlemen are co-accused. They have been charged with manipulating the 17-year-old’s blood alcohol test by swapping his sample with that of his mother’s.The minor’s father and grandfather are booked in another case of abducting their family driver in a bid to force him to take the blame for the car crash. On Friday, the Kondhwa police formally arrested the builder in another criminal case registered this year in connection with a cheating and threatening incident in 2019 and produced him before a court for remand after securing his custody from Yerawada jail. The court, however, said there was no need for his questioning and sent the father to magisterial custody.Lawyer Patil said, “Our client’s bail plea in the abduction case is pending before a magisterial court. We will soon file bail pleas in the May 19 car crash and the recently registered cheating case. Our client and his father have already secured an interim anticipatory bail till June 24 in yet another case of abetment to a businessman’s suicide registered with the Chandanagar police .”",A special court on Friday granted bail to the father of the 17-year-old involved in the Porsche Taycan crash at Kalyaninagar.

NEW DELHI: A Pune district court on Friday granted bail to the father of a minor accused in a case where he was booked under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act for driving a speeding Porsche on May 19 that resulted in the death of Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both IT engineers working in the city.The police have submitted a detailed report requesting the juvenile be tried as an adult due to the severity of the incident.The minor is currently held at an observation home in Pune.In the course of the investigation, Pune police had detained the minor’s parents and grandfather on multiple charges, including tampering with evidence. Apart from them, two doctors were arrested for switching the boy’s blood samples with those of his mother and disposing of the original samples. All those arrested are presently in judicial custody.Initially, the Juvenile Justice Board had released the minor, imposing a sentence that ordered him to assist the traffic police for 15 days and to write a 300-word essay. This decision led to public outcry for stricter measures against the accused.While hearing the case, the High Court remarked that the victims' families are undoubtedly in a state of shock. However, it also noted that the juvenile who caused the accident, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, is likely to be in a state of shock as well, which would have naturally had a profound impact on his mental state.","A Pune district court on Friday granted bail to the father of a minor accused in a case where he was booked under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act.

A total of 47 people had died without responding to medical treatment, and 117 are still undergoing treatment as in-patients in the four hospitals, said the CM in the assembly. By evening, however, the death toll rose to 50.The CM announced additional relief measures for the affected families. Govt would take care of educational expenses of children, who lost either of their parents, and children who lost both parents, would get an additional allowance of Rs 5,000 per month until they attain 18 years of age. Immediate relief from the CM’s public relief fund would include Rs 3 lakh or Rs 5 lakh, depending on whether the child lost one or both parents.Replying to a special calling attention motion moved by the opposition on the tragic incident in Kallakurichi, Stalin, who also handles the portfolio of home department, said he was not running away from any issue. He said four people had been arrested. Methanol used in the liquor had been illegally procured from Puducherry, he added.“We will bring anyone involved in the incident to justice. I am reining in criminals with an iron hand. Methanol produced in the neighbouring state is brought into our state illegally and is causing such incidents,” he said.Detailing the govt’s actions, Stalin said his govt had filed 4.63 lakh cases against bootleggers and arrested 4.61 lakh people in the past three years.He added that Goondas Act had been invoked against 565 people, including 58, in Kallakurichi. The authorities seized and destroyed 16.51 lakh litre of spurious liquor and 1.42 lakh litre of rectified spirit during this period.The chief minister said 57 govt doctors from various regions were deployed in Kallakurichi hospital to expedite treatment, in addition to the existing 161 doctors. “Lifesaving medicines are adequately stocked, and medicines are also procured from the open market to save the people,” he said.Amid questions over the fate of the CB-CID probe into the previous fatalities in Villupuram and Chengalpet last year, Stalin said 21 people were arrested and Goondas Act was imposed on eight people in Villupuram.Sixteen police officers faced disciplinary action. “Investigation revealed that methanol was procured from Andhra Pradesh.

"As Ukraine expands military draft, some men go into hiding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/as-ukraine-expands-military-draft-some-men-go-into-hiding/articleshow/111176672.cms,"First, Vladyslav stopped going into Kyiv, Ukraine 's city center to avoid draft officers checking papers. Then he stopped exercising at the gym because of patrols in his neighborhood. Now he spends most of his days holed up in his apartment, often using his binoculars to watch officers serving draft notices to commuters leaving a nearby subway station.""They're everywhere now,"" said Vladyslav, 45, who, like other Ukrainians in hiding interviewed for this article, requested that his last name not be published. ""I'll try to avoid getting caught,"" he said, ""but I'm not sure it's possible.""As Russian forces are on the attack across the front line , the Ukrainian military has been desperately trying to replenish its war-battered forces, embarking on a large-scale mobilization campaign backed by new laws.While many Ukrainian men have answered the call to serve, some others have tried to evade conscription. Even before the latest mobilization push, thousands of men had fled the country to avoid service, some of them swimming across a river separating Ukraine from Romania. Now, as officers scour the country's cities to draft men of military age, currently 25 to 60, many people like Vladyslav have gone into hiding, fearful that conscription is a one-way ticket to the front line.It is not clear how many men are hiding out, but in big cities like Kyiv and Lviv, social media groups alerting members to the movements of draft officers include tens of thousands of members.Interviews with a dozen men who say they are staying at home to avoid conscription revealed a range of reasons. All expressed fear of dying in a conflict characterized by bloody trench warfare and devastating bombings. Many also said that they opposed conscription because of what they described as harsh draft tactics and a lack of sufficienttraining .""I'm afraid I won't get enough training, and then I'll be moved closer to the front, and then I'll die senselessly,"" said Mykyta, a 28-year-old web designer from Lviv, in western Ukraine.Those fears are backed by some military analysts, who say that Ukrainian troops often lack adequate training, which makes it difficult for Kyiv to hold its lines, as they are quickly sent into battle to replace combat losses.Col. Volodymyr Novosiadlyi, an official responsible for conscription in Kyiv, said that training lasted at least a month and that the army tried to treat draftees with fairness and empathy. But he added that ""every citizen should understand the need to fulfill their duties"" in defending their country.Many Ukrainian men have joined the military out of a sense of civic duty. And since a new mobilization law passed in April, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that 1.6 million men had updated or registered their details on a government website, the first step before a possible call-up.Since the war's beginning, the draft has been somewhat disorganized and marred by corruption. There was no lottery, and the government used tactics such as randomly handing out draft notices in apartment blocks and on city streets. Ignoring draft notices is illegal.The new law requires all draft-age men to register with the government, including providing an address, and draftees will be chosen from that group. Failing to register by July 16 will become a criminal offense.Tymofii Brik, a sociologist at the Kyiv School of Economics, said that polling ""suggests the willingness to defend the nation among Ukrainians has remained consistent"" throughout the war, with about one-third of people indicating a readiness to serve.Still, Ukraine's mobilization drive has opened up painful divisions in society. Vitaliy Bondarenko, a 29-year-old draft officer in Lviv, said men scurried away every time his vehicle pulled up.""They see us and run,"" he said.Many Ukrainian soldiers resent those trying to avoid the draft, saying that their actions weaken their country's war effort . ""Given the intensity of the current combat, the army cannot fight without regular replenishment of personnel,"" said another Mykyta, 25, who was recently drafted and gave only his first name per military rules. Denying that reality, he added, ""is unacceptable and simply stupid.""For much of the war's first two years, the Ukrainian military refrained from large-scale mobilization, relying instead on the tens of thousands of volunteers who joined its ranks after Russia invaded in February 2022.But by the end of last summer, the need for more soldiers became evident, after a counteroffensive by Ukraine failed and Russian troops stepped up their attacks.""That's when the first red flags appeared,"" said Vladyslav, who is a journalist. In September, he said, a draft notice was pinned to his apartment door.Vladyslav ignored it, hoping it was not legally binding because it was not handed to him, but his fear of being drafted increased. He said he had fallen into depression. In a recent interview in a park outside his apartment, he shuddered as a soldier walked by.Oleksandr, a 32-year-old data analyst from Kyiv, said he ""started to feel afraid last summer,"" after seeing officers stopping a man outside a subway station near his home. ""They grabbed him by the shoulders and took him into a car,"" he said, adding that the officers had lined up along the station's exit stairs to prevent anyone from escaping.""I felt like the next hand was going to grab my shoulder,"" he said.Some of the men evading the draft say that they now only travel by taxi to avoid being pulled off the streets and forcibly taken to conscription centers, as has happened in several cases. Others rely on food deliveries to elude draft officers.Oleksandr said he had started assessing which routes were the safest to go to work and monitored groups on the Telegram messaging app where people track draft officers' movements. In Kyiv, a group with more than 200,000 members uses colors like green to signal the presence of draft officers and warns of the risk of being stopped as sunny, cloudy and stormy.""But after two weeks, all the routes I could take became unsafe,"" Oleksandr said. He recalled being unable to sleep. ""The fear built up over time, growing like a lump in my chest,"" he said. He now works from home nearly every day.Vladyslav, Mykyta and Oleksandr all said that they donated to the Ukrainian armed forces and were not completely opposed to joining the army.They say their main objection is Ukraine's mobilization process, which they feel pays little attention to people's physical abilities and skills and just sends them to a likely death. Medical checks are often rushed, they said, and training is not long enough.Jack Watling, a military expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank in London, said that most Ukrainian soldiers were lucky if they got five weeks of training. By contrast, Britain trained infantry soldiers for about 22 weeks during World War II, he said.Novosiadlyi noted that conscription officers, who are often war veterans, have a difficult job because of the hostility they face on the streets.They are mobilizing people ""not because they like it,"" he said, but because they understand the urgent need to replenish troops.Still, people have watched with concern as Ukraine steps up its mobilization efforts, including tightening border patrols to catch those trying to flee the country.Andrii, another 28-year-old web designer from Lviv, described himself as ""a bit paranoid."" He goes days without leaving his apartment, relying on a friend to deliver him food. On the rare occasions when he leaves home, he wears an electronic bracelet with a red SOS button that, when pressed, sends his location to relatives.Andrii said that if he is caught, he will push the button so they can find out which recruitment center he is being taken to and try to help him.Oleksandr, the data analyst, said that he didn't want to break the law and would ultimately go online to update his details, after which he expects to be called for a medical examination. He has pinned his hopes on being declared unfit because of his slender physique.But, he said, ""It feels like a lottery.""",Ukrainian military has been desperately trying to replenish its war-battered forces.

In a taped recording of the speech, Bezalel Smotrich can be heard suggesting that goal was to prevent West Bank from becoming part of a Palestinian state .Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that Israel's rule over the territory amounts to a temporary military occupation overseen by army generals, not a permanent civilian annexation administered by Israeli civil servants. Smotrich's June 9 speech at a West Bank private gathering may make that posture harder to maintain.In it, he outlined a carefully orchestrated programme to take authority over the West Bank out of the hands of the Israeli military and turn it over to civilians working for Smotrich in the defence ministry . Parts of the plan have already been introduced over the past 18 months, and some authorities have already been transferred to civilians.To deflect international scrutiny, the govt has allowed the defence ministry to remain involved in the process, he said. ""It will be easier to swallow in the international and legal context,"" Smotrich said. ""So that they won't say that we are doing annexation here.""Smotrich, a far-right lawmaker, said Netanyahu was ""with us full on"".Even as international pressure grows to declare a Palestinian state that would encompass the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Smotrich's comments suggest that Israel is quietly working to firm up its control over the West Bank.",Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that Israel's rule over the territory amounts to a temporary military occupation overseen by army generals.

China's grip faces strain amid strengthened Russia-North Korea relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-grip-faces-strain-amid-strengthened-russia-north-korea-relations/articleshow/111180544.cms,"China appears to be maintaining its distance as Russia and North Korea solidify their relationship through a new defence pact, raising concerns over a potential shift in the power dynamics among these three authoritarian states.This development, marked by the agreement between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin , has left China in a challenging position. China's conflicting goals of maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula while countering US influence complicate its response.China has yet to publicly comment on the pact, which mandates mutual defence assistance between Russia and North Korea in case either is attacked. Instead, it has emphasised its commitment to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and a political resolution to the North-South divide. This muted reaction, according to experts, may indicate China's uncertainty on how to respond.“The Chinese response has been ‘very weak,’” noted Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Every option is a bad option,"" he elaborated, suggesting Beijing might be struggling due to internal disagreements or an inability to evaluate the situation effectively.Some viewpoints in China might see the Russia-North Korea alignment as a counterbalance to US dominance. Still, Cha believes there is considerable discomfort in China: ""There is also a great deal of discomfort."" China values its influence over North Korea, fears the rise of a destabilising nuclear power nearby, and is wary of drawing the European conflict into Asia. By not voicing these concerns openly, China hopes to avoid driving Kim Jong Un closer to Vladimir Putin.Victor Cha added, ""They don’t want to push Kim Jong Un further into the arms of Vladimir Putin.""John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, addressed the pact, stating, ""The pact between Russia and North Korea ‘should be of concern to any country that believes that the UN Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by.'” The Security Council has sanctioned North Korea to halt its nuclear weapon development. Kirby further noted, ""It should be of concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do. And we would think that that concern would be shared by the People's Republic of China.""Another area of concern for China could be the potential for Russia to aid North Korea's weapons program with advanced technology.The meeting between Putin and Kim is another event in the complex political and military landscape of East Asia, where China's influence has grown significantly in recent decades. This development has prompted concerns in the US that China could form alliances with countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran to challenge the US-led international order. Beijing, however, disputes this notion.Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, stated that China does not aim to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia: ""Beijing doesn't want to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia because it ‘needs to keep its options open.’”A coalition could point toward a new Cold War, which Beijing seeks to avoid. Such an alliance would also conflict with China's goals of maintaining positive relationships with Europe and improving ties with Japan and South Korea. Sun added, ""The rapprochement between North Korea and Moscow ‘opens up possibilities and potentials of uncertainty, but based on what has happened so far, I don't think that China's national interests have been undercut by this.'”Closer ties between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin potentially weaken Beijing's influence and could make it ""the biggest loser,"" according to Danny Russel, who served as the top US diplomat for Asia during the Obama administration.","China has yet to publicly comment on the pact, which mandates mutual defence assistance between Russia and North Korea.

One official told Reuters they were still digesting the contents of the new guidelines.The guidelines detail what is considered a crime worthy of punishment, including promoting Taiwan's entry to international organisations where statehood is a condition, having ""external official exchanges"" and ""suppressing"" parties, groups and people that promote ""reunification"".The guidelines add a further clause to what could be considered a crime - ""other acts that seek to separate Taiwan from China"" - meaning the rules can be broadly interpreted.Lai has repeatedly offered to hold talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.China has taken legal measures against Taiwanese officials before, including imposing sanctions on Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's former de facto ambassador to the United States and now the island's vice president.Such punishments have little practical effect as Chinese courts do not have jurisdiction in Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.Senior Taiwanese officials, including its president, also do not visit China.","Taiwan has complained of a pattern of ramped up Chinese pressure since Lai won the election in January.

Speculation about Kim's well-being intensified after a former CIA analyst remarked, ""Oof, he doesn't look too great,"" referencing Kim's appearance during their recent meeting.During the highly anticipated summit, Kim Jong-Un and Vladimir Putin signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty aimed at strengthening the bilateral ties between their countries. The agreement emphasizes mutual military support in times of conflict and seeks to enhance trade and security cooperation. This development marks a significant step in the geopolitical landscape , underscoring the alliance between North Korea and Russia against Western powers.However, amid the formalities and strategic discussions, Kim Jong-Un's physical condition became a focal point. The North Korean leader appeared noticeably less vigorous, prompting speculations about his health. This isn't the first time Kim's health has come under scrutiny; past reports have suggested issues ranging from obesity to potential cardiovascular problems, a Daily Mail report said.""There was a time when he lost a little weight and he looked better. So my initial reaction was that he didn’t look, in terms of being healthy, because his health is something that we always track anyway,"" Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst, told CNN.International observers and analysts are now closely monitoring Kim Jong-Un's health, as his ability to lead North Korea remains a critical issue.

NEW DELHI: Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) on Friday declared that it has eliminated a leading Hamas sniper and Nukhba Forces Commander involved in the October 7 attack on its territory.The Israeli military said its IAF aircraft conducted a precision and targeted strike to kill Hamas terrorist Ahmed Hassan Salame Alsauarka in northern Gaza 's Beit Hanoun .The IDF claimed that Alsauarka was a squad commander in the Nukhba Forces who infiltrated into and carried out attacks on communities in southern Israel on October 7.Alsauarka led and directed sniper activity in the area of Beit Hanoun and took part in Hamas' attacks on IDF troops. Prior to the strike, a number of steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians during the operation. As a result, no civilians were injured during the strike, IDF said.The IDF shared the clip of the attack carried out on X.Last month, Israeli aircraft killed 15 terrorists in a strike on a Hamas command center located inside a UNRWA school.The war room was embedded in a UN Relief and Works Agency school in the central Gaza area of Nuseirat.According to the IDF, at least 10 of the terror operatives killed were members of Hamas with the rest being members of other terror groups.The IDF's announcement included a map of the school compound along with the location of the Hamas war room.""The Hamas war room had been used by the terrorist organisation to plan multiple attacks against IDF troops in central Gaza in recent weeks.

Louisiana becomes first state to allow surgical castration as punishment for child molesters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisiana-becomes-first-state-to-allow-surgical-castration-as-punishment-for-child-molesters/articleshow/111180000.cms,"Louisiana has become the first state where judges can order offenders guilty of certain sex crimes against children to undergo surgical castration under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Tuesday.While the punishment of surgical castration is used in other countries that are known for harsher criminal sanctions - including the Czech Republic and Nigeria - it will be new in the US The governor's office confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that Landry had signed the bill earlier in the week.Proponents of the Louisiana law, which takes effect Aug. 1, hope the new possible punishment will deter people from committing sex crimes against children. Opponents argue that it is ""cruel and unusual"" punishment in violation of the US Constitution. They say it is sure to face legal challenges.The legislation gives Louisiana judges the option to sentence someone to surgical castration after the person has been convicted of certain aggravated sex crimes - including rape, incest and molestation - against a child under 13. The punishment is not automatic and would be by individual cases and at the discretion of the judge.Louisiana has 2,224 people in prison for such crimes. The law can be applied only to those who have convicted a crime on or after Aug. 1 of this year.A handful of states, including Louisiana, California, Florida and Texas, have laws allowing for chemical castration for those guilty of certain sex crimes. In some of those states, offenders can opt for the surgical procedure if they prefer. But no other state allows judges to impose surgical castration outright, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.In Louisiana, which for 16 years has allowed judges to order chemical castration of people convicted of certain sex crimes against children, that punishment is rarely issued. Chemical castration uses medications that block testosterone production to decrease sex drive. Surgical castration is a much more invasive procedure that involves the removal of both testicles or ovaries.An offender who ""fails to appear or refuses to undergo"" surgical castration after a judge orders the procedure could be hit with a ""failure to comply"" charge and face an additional three to five years in prison, based on the bill's language.The bill received overwhelming approval in both of the GOP-dominated chambers. State Sen. Regina Barrow, a Democrat, authored the legislation, but votes against it mainly came from Democrats.""We are talking about babies who are being violated by somebody,"" Barrow said during an April committee meeting. ""That is inexcusable.""Proponents of the measure argue that the punishment is just for horrific crimes against children. Critics argue that the state should focus on the rehabilitation of those guilty of such crimes in an effort to lower recidivism rates.Others wonder if more states may look at adopting a similar law to Louisiana's and question the constitutionality of such measures. The US has decided that retributive punishment - ""an eye for an eye"" - is cruel and unusual, said Katrina Sifferd, a philosophy professor at Elmhurst University.""We don't rape rapists,"" she said. ""We don't cut off the hands of thieves.""The legislation is one of several controversial bills signed by Landry this week, including a measure allowing law enforcement to jail people who enter the US illegally, similar to a Texas law and others facing legal challenges.Republican states and Democratic President Joe Biden have been fighting over US-Mexico border security. If the Supreme Court upholds the Texas law, Louisiana's law will expand enforcement of immigration law to local, not just federal, authorities. It also creates the crime of ""illegal entry or reentry"" into the state and establishes punishments that include prison time and thousands of dollars in fines.","Louisiana is the first state where judges can order offenders guilty of certain sex crimes against children to undergo surgical castration.

Attacker of Nancy Pelosi's husband also found guilty of kidnapping and faces life in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/attacker-of-nancy-pelosis-husband-also-found-guilty-of-kidnapping-and-faces-life-in-prison/articleshow/111179946.cms,"A man sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in the attack against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's husband was convicted Friday by a San Francisco jury of aggravated kidnapping , a conviction that mandates life behind bars without the possibility of paroleA San Francisco jury found David DePape also guilty of first-degree burglary, false imprisonment of an elder, threatening a family member of a public official and dissuading a witness.The convictions on the additional charges come weeks after a federal judge sentenced DePape for the 2022 attack against Paul Pelosi .""Speaker Pelosi and her family remain in awe of their Pop's bravery, which shone through again on the witness stand in this trial just as it did when he saved his own life on the night of the attack,"" Pelosi's office wrote in an emailed statement Friday. ""For nearly 20 grueling months, Mr. Pelosi has demonstrated extraordinary courage and fortitude every day of his recovery.""DePape's public defender Adam Lipson said he was disappointed with the verdict and plans to appeal it. He called the prosecutors' decision to file a kidnapping for ransom charge ""vindictive.""""It's really unfortunate that it was charged this way. It was sort of a textbook vindictive prosecution,"" Lipson said. ""As soon as they found that the attempted murder charge was going to be dismissed, they added this charge.""Lipson said that the verdict means that after DePape serves 30 years in federal prison, he will be transferred to a California ""to spend the rest of his life in a California prison.""Lipson told the jury during closing arguments this week that DePape was guilty of three of the charges but that prosecutors had not presented evidence to convict him of threatening a family member of a public official and aggravated kidnapping.Previously, a federal jury convicted DePape of assaulting a federal official's family member and attempting to kidnap a federal official. On May 28, he was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison during an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error.Lipson earlier argued that the state trial represents double jeopardy following the federal conviction. Even though the criminal counts are not the same, the two cases stem from the same act, he told the judge.San Francisco Superior Court Judge Harry Dorfman agreed and dismissed the state charges of attempted murder, elder abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. Another judge upheld the decision on appeal.Lipson focused his closing arguments on explaining to the jury that prosecutors did not prove DePape kidnapped Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, with the intent ""to exact from another person money or something valuable,"" which is integral to the charge.Assistant District Attorney Phoebe Maffei told the jury in her closing arguments that DePape had planned to record a video of his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi.Lipson argued the video didn't exist and if it did, it wouldn't have had any value.""When he broke into the Pelosis' home his intent was to confront and potentially hurt and assault Nancy Pelosi. That was his intent at that time, that has nothing to do with Mr. Pelosi,"" he said.In her rebuttal, Maffei pointed out DePape told a detective and testified in federal court that he planned to get a video of Nancy Pelosi confessing to what he believed to be crimes and post it on the internet.""There is inherent value in a video of the Speaker of the House confessing to crimes in her own home,"" Maffei said.The attack on Paul Pelosi was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections and shocked the political world. He suffered two head wounds including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured.On Monday, Maffei told the jury DePape unleashed a ""reign of terror"" on Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning him with a hammer as part of a plan he put together over months.""The plain facts of this case are terrifying by themselves without embellishment,"" Maffei said. ""David DePape broke into the home of an 82-year-old man while he slept, entered his bedroom, held him hostage with a hammer, threatened him, threatened his wife and attempted to kill him.""DePape admitted during his federal trial testimony that he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, record his interrogation of her, and ""break her kneecaps"" if she did not admit to the lies he said she told about ""Russiagate,"" a reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.Lipson told the jury during closing arguments that before the attack, DePape was living an isolated, lonely life and ""went down the rabbit hole of propaganda and conspiracy theories.""This week the judge expelled DePape's former partner from the public gallery and the second floor of the San Francisco courthouse because the judge said she was trying to tamper with the jury.On Monday and Tuesday, Gypsy Taub, a well-known activist in the Bay Area, handed out pieces of paper outside the courtroom with the address of a website she runs that promotes conspiracy theories. The cards were also found in a women's bathroom near the courtroom, where the website's address was scrawled in marker on a wall.""You have been trying to corruptly influence one or more jury members,"" Dorfman said sternly before asking two bailiffs to escort Taub out of the courtroom.DePape's federal public defender said during his federal sentencing that DePape was first exposed to extreme beliefs by Taub, who has two sons with DePape.Taub met DePape in Hawaii when he was 20 years old and she was in her 30s and pregnant, DePape's twin sister, Joanne Robinson, said in a letter to the federal judge seeking leniency.Robinson wrote that Taub isolated DePape from his family and inflicted ""extreme psychological damage"" on her brother.","David DePape was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in May. A San Francisco jury found him guilty Friday of aggravated kidnapping. He was also found guilty of burglary, false imprisonment of an elder, threatening a family member of a public official.

This decision follows reports raising concerns about his involvement in unethical news gathering practices in Britain. Winnett, currently the deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph, will not assume his new role as planned, as confirmed through communications to staff at both newspapers.“It is with regret that I share with you that Robert Winnett has withdrawn from the position of Editor at The Washington Post,” Will Lewis , The Post’s embattled publisher and chief executive, told staff in a Friday morning memo.Winnett, known for his keen pursuit of scoops which earned him the nickname ""Rat Boy,"" was confronted by recent reports that questioned his suitability for the role.

Matt Murray, former editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal, is set to replace Sally Buzbee in an interim capacity during this period.

automatic green card

: 5 things to know

Donald Trump's automatic green card proposal is to retain high-skilled workers in the country. In a podcast, Trump said it's said when the US loses people from Harvard and MIT. This automatic Green Card will be given to all foreign students as part of their diploma and this would include students attending junior colleges in the US too. ""...people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't -- they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here,"" Trump said. But will all foreign graduates get Green Cards if Donald Trump becomes the president? In a statement Friday morning, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the former president's proposal would apply to ""the most skilled graduates"" who are ""the most thoroughly vetted."" Communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters will not get automatic Green Cards, Leavitt said. ""He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America. This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.” Donald Trump did not set a good precedent on immigration earlier. He began his presidency by banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half. Throughout his presidency, Trump assailed the H-1B visa program, favored by tech companies as a way to hire foreign skilled workers, as a ""theft of American prosperity.""

Republican presidential presumptive candidate Donald Trump suggested automatic green cards for foreign graduates if he becomes the president. This means all those who graduate from US colleges will automatically become US citizens. Chasing the Green Card Dream looks lucrative in Trump's US, but he said the same thing during his 2016 campaign and then limited legal migration when he was in office.A Green Card is a Permanent Resident Card in the US. Joe Biden recently unveiled a new immigration program offering legal status to spouses of US citizens.","Donald Trump's proposal is to retain high-skilled workers in the country.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community. He called for an end to the misuse of blasphemy accusations and fabricated justifications for violence, stressing the need for systemic reforms to ensure minority safety.The HRFP report underscores the urgent situation faced by Christians in Pakistan and advocates for international and local intervention to uphold human rights and justice.","Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.
