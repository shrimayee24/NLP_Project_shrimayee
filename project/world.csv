Another reform vs tradition clash brews in Kerala over shirtless rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-reform-vs-tradition-clash-brews-in-kerala-over-shirtless-rule/articleshow/116955673.cms,"The year was 1982. A scuffle broke out in the dining hall of the Guruvayur temple complex when those serving special free meals manhandled a person who refused to remove his upper garment. They demanded to know whether the person who sat among the sacred thread-wearing shirtless men was a Brahmin or not. For, it was a 'Brahmin Oottu' (meal) and those belonging to other castes were unwelcome. The person who challenged the custom was spiritual leader and social reformer Sree Narayana Guru 's disciple Swami Ananda Theerthan, known for his relentless fighting against caste discrimination.As news about the manhandling of Ananda Theerthan made headlines the next day, temple authorities and the govt faced severe criticism. The then chief minister K Karunakaran reacted swiftly. The practice of 'Brahmana Oottu' was abolished, and a mass feast organised in the same dining area. Karunakaran, along with several other community members including Dalit activist and writer Kallara Sukumaran, participated in the event.However, the practice of some temples insisting that male devotees enter the temple with bare upper bodies continues to this day. Now, four decades later, a call by Satchidananda Swamy, head of Sivagiri mutt which was founded by Sree Narayana Guru, to do away with the shirtless tradition has sparked a fresh debate. Satchidananda Swamy put across his demand in the presence of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan at the inaugural session of the annual Sivagiri pilgrimage. The mutt chief argued that the dress code had nothing to do with scriptures or spirituality and was a disgusting residue of casteism in Kerala. ""Temples and deities are instruments that help devotees reach the formless and nameless God. It has nothing to do with the external appearance or the dress code of the devotees. What is going on in the devotee's mind while inside the temple and in front of the deity is the only thing that matters,"" said Swamy.According to him, such dress codes were the invention of the clergy aimed at excluding non-Brahmins from temples. He pointed out that even some non-Brahmin priests were trying to enforce such Brahmanical traditions, including in some temples under the Sivagiri mutt's administration.Vijayan who, just a few days earlier attempted to disassociate Sree Narayana Guru from Sanatana Dharma, responded positively to Satchidananda Swamy's call but with caution. He said the abolition of the dress code restrictions should be done only after reaching a consensus among temple stakeholders. The CM's measured response was probably on account of the bitter experience his govt faced when it tried to implement the Supreme Court's order permitting women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala temple.""Satchidananda Swamy's suggestion is a positive one. But the Devaswom board alone cannot take a decision. Consensus is essential,"" said Travancore Devaswom Board president P S Prasanth, echoing the CM's sentiment.According to historian M G Sasibhooshan, the dress code might have originated as an attempt to discourage people from casually straying into temples or treating them as tourist spots. But he pointed out that such restrictions are prevalent only in Kerala or in a few temples like the Sri Mookambika Temple in Karnataka due to shared traditions with Malayali Brahmins. Most other Indian temples allow devotees to enter even the sanctum sanctorum without dress code restrictions.Sasibhooshan also said the Kerala govt had made an abortive attempt to abolish dress code restrictions in the 1970s. The discussion took a contentious turn after Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G Sukumaran Nair came out against Pinarayi Vijayan's support for Swamy's proposal. Nair argued that temple traditions could not be altered by anyone, including the govt. He also questioned Satchidananda Swamy's right to challenge temple practices. According to him, each temple had its own practices and traditions, and the dress code was an essential part of it.The war of words continued as Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan launched a counter-attack on the NSS general secretary, saying such issues should not divide the Hindu community. Yogakshema Sabha president Akkeeraman Kaladasan Bhattathirippad struck a more conciliatory tone. He acknowledged that unnecessary restrictions and evil practices should indeed be abolished but stressed that changes must be implemented through broader consultation on a case-by-case basis.He also rejected the argument that the dress code existed to help Brahmin priests identify their community members. ""Customs and traditions vary across temples. For instance, Sabarimala temple has no dress code restrictions, and even non-Hindus are welcome there. But the same temple doesn't allow women between 10 to 50 age groups to enter. We are not against change, but it's unfortunate to attribute Brahminical hegemony to anything and everything,"" he said.","Satchidananda Swamy, head of Sivagiri mutt, calls for end to shirtless tradition. He argues that the dress code had nothing to do with scriptures or spirituality. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan backs Swamy's call, but with caution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116955694,imgsize-530384,width-400,resizemode-4/116955694.jpg"

His lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay presented excerpts from Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report, which did not find any sign of struggle between the victim and the assailant on the mattress on the wooden dais in the hospital's seminar room, where the PGT doctor's body was found lying in an ""awkward position"" on Aug 9.The report also mentioned that, except on the mattress, no biological stain could be detected on, around or underneath the wooden stage or the wooden table nearby.

Even as the court heard arguments, lawyers for the victim's parents submitted a sealed envelope, reportedly containing names of some more persons allegedly involved in the crime, and 35 points indicating the involvement of others.""The investigations by CBI and Kolkata police suggest that many other persons were involved.

The waste was transported to Pithampur (near Indore) on court orders, he said. ""If any security concerns or fear arise among the public, the state govt will present it before the court. No further action will be taken until the court provides clear directions. The govt is committed to complying with court orders and will proceed only as per its instructions,"" the CM said.On Friday, violence broke out as protesters clashed with police in the industrial township near Indore. Two of the protesters tried to immolate themselves and are in hospital with burns. Taken aback by the protests, MP govt said Saturday it would request HC for more time to dispose of waste from the 1984 tragedy.State chief secretary Anurag Jain Saturday said govt will present an affidavit in HC to apprise it of public sentiments and seek more time. Further action on waste disposal will not be taken without taking the public into confidence, Jain said in Bhopal. He said everything has been done according to SC guidelines.“The waste has only been transported so far. No immediate decision has been taken to burn it,” Jain said, adding: “After discussing all the points related to this, when it emerges that the situation is completely under control, only then the waste will be disposed of.”Protests by Pithampur citizens continued for the second day Saturday. At least 80 industries were forced to shut operations as workers, apprehensive about their safety amid escalating unrest in the industrial township, did not report for duty. This resulted in significant production losses in the state’s largest industrial hub.Gautam Kothari, president of Pithampur Audhyogik Sanghatan, said, “This situation could have been averted if govt had established proper communication channels with residents. There were no assurances or dialogue with locals, leading to this mismanaged situation.”“Not a single worker reported to work Saturday. Since we are in the same sector as the waste disposal plant, the situation in this vicinity is extremely tense. Our production losses are mounting,” said Jitesh Agrawal, MD of a bag manufacturing firm in Pithampur.","Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav says no action will be carried out until further court orders.

JD Vance's reaction went viral.

Vice President Kamala Harris Friday swore in the senators as the 119th Congress convened. A video of Vice President-elect JD Vance laughing as Kamala Harris read out the oath went viral. Donald Trump Jr too shared the video with a smiling emoji. But JD Vance did not probably mean any insult to Kamala Harris as he clapped after the swearing was over. Harris too was seen with a pleasant smile on her face as she faced the Republicans after the bitterly fought election.Harris’s role as vice president includes duties performed as president of the Senate, including breaking ties and presiding over impeachment trials not involving a sitting president. It also includes swearing in new senators-elect so they can begin their terms.Many of the Republicans Kamala Harris swore in today could not pronounce her name, the Time Magazine headlined its article about the swearing-in today.JD Vance shared a photo from the swearing-in event, especially the moment he was caught laughing. ""I was proud to stand with ⁦ @berniemoreno ⁩ and ⁦ @DaveMcCormickPA ⁩ as they were sworn in to the US Senate. Congrats to them and to all of our new senators!"" Vance wrote. ""When Vice President Kamala Harris arrives at the Capitol on Friday to swear-in the new class of Senators, many of the smiling politicians handing her their family Bibles will be the same ones who for months have been telling crowds that she was a threat to the American way of life. At campaign rallies, on social media, and in interviews, some spent months falsely claiming she wanted to ban Christmas from the calendar, bring dog meat to immigrants’ stoves, or rig the election by inviting undocumented immigrants to flood polling places and cast illegal ballots,"" the report said.""It’s an inelegant reality that every Vice President faces in their role as the President of the Senate, one that is particularly raw for those like Harris, Al Gore, and Richard Nixon who lost their presidential bids but still had to return for a final few weeks of a grind at the Capitol. Former Senators all, they understood that the norms of the Upper Chamber could not be set aside to save their bruised ego, nor would these institutionalists ask to be spared. Standing there with folks who trashed them is just part of the gig.

These arrangements typically involve foreign women paying Singaporean men to marry them, enabling the women to secure permits to stay or work in the country, The Straits Times reported.Inspector Mark Chai, deputy officer-in-charge of ICA's intelligence division, warned that such marriages pose social risks in Singapore's multi-ethnic society. ""The idea of such marriages is often spread through word of mouth. And to some Singaporean men, it can be seen as easy money,"" he said.However, he stressed that these arrangements are illegal and said, ""ICA is stepping up enforcement efforts to bust such arrangements.""According to The Straits Times report, One recent case involved a 33-year-old Singaporean man living in a flat in Bukit Batok, who had been married to a Vietnamese woman for several years, according to marriage documents. However, ICA officers received a tip-off that it was a sham marriage.ICA officers on December 11 raided the flat and found no evidence of a married couple living there. There were no women’s clothes, and the man’s mother told officers she was unaware of her son’s marriage.When questioned, the man claimed his wife lived with him and said her clothes were stored elsewhere. He was subsequently arrested for allegedly making false declarations in applications for immigration facilities.Superintendent Goh Wee Kiat, senior assistant director at ICA's intelligence division, highlighted that public tip-offs often help uncover such cases. He noted that there are telltale signs of sham marriages, such as family members being unaware of the union or spouses living separately.In one instance, a Singaporean man falsely claimed his ""wife"" lived with him, but investigations revealed her belongings were stored elsewhere. ""The couple can try to hide the fact that their union is a marriage of convenience, but there are telltale signs that our officers are able to spot,"" Goh said.Convictions for participating in sham marriages can result in up to 10 years in prison, fines of up to SGD 10,000, or both. In June 2024, 13 individuals – seven Singaporean men and six Vietnamese women – were charged for their alleged involvement in such arrangements.Authorities have urged the public to report suspected cases, assuring that all information provided will be treated with strict confidentiality.","Singapore authorities have raised concerns over a sharp increase in ""sham marriages"" or "" marriages of convenience"" These are predominantly between Singaporean men and foreign women, often facilitated by syndicates. 32 cases of sham marriages between January and September 2024, a stark rise compared to just four during the same period in 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116957155,imgsize-1948511,width-400,resizemode-4/116957155.jpg"

Renowned chef and humanitarian José Andrés received the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom during a White House ceremony on Saturday. The Spanish-American chef, known for revolutionizing the tapas scene in the US and leading the World Central Kitchen initiative, was honored alongside other luminaries, including Hillary Clinton , Bono, and Lionel Messi. However, his moment of triumph is now overshadowed by a shocking photo of Andrés with Ryan Wesley Routh, the man who attempted to assassinate incoming President Donald Trump in September.The disturbing image shows Andrés with Routh, who allegedly tried to kill Trump while the former president was golfing at his West Palm Beach club. Secret Service agents foiled the assassination attempt when they saw Routh carrying a gun, though he hadn’t fired. The situation unfolded quickly as Routh fled the scene, dropping his AR-15-style rifle, only to be captured by nearby police.While the photo of Andrés with Routh has raised eyebrows, the chef’s legacy remains firmly rooted in his humanitarian work. Andrés founded World Central Kitchen (WCK), a nonprofit organization that feeds people in disaster zones. His work has earned him widespread recognition, including the National Humanities Medal , which he received from the White House in 2016.The Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President Joe Biden, recognizes outstanding individuals in fields ranging from science and politics to civil rights and entertainment. Despite the unexpected controversy, Andrés stands firm in his commitment to making the world a better place through food and charity.","José Andrés received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a White House ceremony on Saturday.

Conservative outrage erupted on Fox & Friends over the Biden administration ’s latest round of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients, with hosts and pundits sparing no words in their condemnation. The list included controversial figures like Hillary Clinton and billionaire George Soros , whose inclusion triggered particularly fiery reactions.On Saturday morning’s broadcast, host Rachel Campos-Duffy warned her co-host, Joe Concha, to brace himself. “Joe, gird yourself,” she said. “Today, Biden is going to present—get this—Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and 17 others with the Presidential Medal of Freedom!”Soros, long vilified by conservatives for his extensive funding of progressive causes, was labeled by Campos-Duffy as the “most evil man.” His financial support for political accountability and media projects has made him a prime target for far-right critics, with many accusing him of attempting to manipulate global politics.The reaction was swift and vehement. Elon Musk called the selection a “travesty,” while Steve Bannon , a vocal opponent of Soros, described the award as a badge of honor for a man he believes epitomizes everything wrong with the current administration. “Soros and Hillary to get the nation’s highest civilian award from the illegitimate Biden regime today,” Bannon lamented.The backlash continued to build as social media erupted with critiques, with users questioning why such divisive figures were being honored with the prestigious medal. For many conservatives, the decision underscored their view of a White House that favors the political left, offering the Medal of Freedom as a symbol of political loyalty rather than merit.Despite the criticism, the White House defended its selections, emphasizing the significant contributions of the honorees to public service, human rights, and global democracy. However, for many on the right, including Fox & Friends hosts, the inclusion of Soros in particular was a bridge too far, prompting a fiery condemnation of what they see as Biden’s attempt to honor figures they view as divisive and controversial.","Conservative outrage erupted on Fox & Friends over the Biden administration ’s latest round of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.

Israel confirmed on Saturday that negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal had resumed in Qatar, as rescuers said more than 30 people had been killed in fresh bombardment of the territory.The civil defence agency said a dawn air strike on the home of the al-Ghoula family in Gaza City killed 11 people, seven of them children.images from the neighbourhood of Shujaiya showed residents combing through smoking rubble. Bodies including those of small children were lined up on the ground, shrouded in white sheets.As the violence raged, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed that indirect negotiations with Hamas had resumed in Qatar for the release of hostages seized in the October 2023 attacks.The minister told relatives of one of the hostages, woman soldier Liri Albag, that ""efforts are under way to free the hostages, notably the Israeli delegation which left yesterday (Friday) for negotiations in Qatar"", his office said.Katz said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had given ""detailed instructions for the continued negotiations"".He was speaking after Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, released a video of Albag in captivity in Gaza.In the undated, three-and-half-minute recording that AFP has not been able to verify, the 19-year-old conscript called in Hebrew for the Israeli government to secure her release.In response, her family issued an appeal to Netanyahu, saying: ""It's time to take decisions as if it were your own children there.""A total of 96 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the latest video was ""firm and incontestable proof of the urgency of bringing the hostages home"".Hamas had said late on Friday that the negotiations were poised to resume.The militant group, whose October 7, 2023, attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, said they would ""focus on ensuring the agreement leads to a complete cessation of hostilities (and) the withdrawal of occupation forces"".Mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been engaged in months of effort that have failed to end nearly 15 months of war.In December, Qatar expressed optimism that ""momentum"" was returning to the talks following the US election of Donald Trump, who takes office in 16 days.But Hamas and Israel then accused each other of setting new conditions and obstacles.As the clock ticks down to the handover of power in Washington, the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden notified Congress of an $8 billion arms sale to Israel, a source familiar with the plan said on Saturday.""The department has informally notified Congress of an $8 billion proposed sale of munitions to support Israel's long-term security by resupplying stocks of critical munitions and air defence capabilities,"" the official said.The United States is Israel's largest military supplier.- 'Everything was shaking' -Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the Ghoula home in Gaza City ""was completely destroyed"" by the dawn strike.""It was a two-storey building and several people are still under the rubble,"" he said, adding Israeli drones had ""also fired on ambulance staff"".Contacted by AFP, the Israeli army did not immediately comment.""A huge explosion woke us up. Everything was shaking,"" said neighbour Ahmed Mussa.""It was home to children, women. There wasn't anyone wanted or who posed a threat.""Elsewhere, the civil defence agency said an Israeli strike killed five security officers tasked with accompanying aid convoys as they drove through the southern city of Khan Yunis.The Israeli army said the five had been ""implicated in terrorist activities"" and were not escorting aid trucks at the time of the strike.Rescuers said strikes elsewhere in Gaza killed 10 other people.AFP images showed Palestine Red Crescent paramedics in Gaza City moving the body of one of their colleagues, his green jacket laid over the blanket that covered his corpse.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said a total of 136 people had been killed over the previous 48 hours.On Sunday, the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen in the latest of a series of attacks.Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels have been firing missiles and drones at Israel -- as well as at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden -- in what they say is a solidarity campaign with Palestinians during the war in Gaza.The Hamas attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 45,717 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.","Israel confirms indirect negotiations with Hamas have resumed in Qatar for release of hostages seized in October 2023 attacks.

A decorated soldier, a hidden struggle

A silent cry for help

A tragic final symbol

Pain unspoken

The tragic death of Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger , who died by suicide in a Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day, has shed light on the mental toll of war. The decorated Special Forces soldier had confided in his ex-girlfriend about the emotional scars he carried after serving in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.Livelsberger, 37, was a five-time Bronze Star recipient , including one with a “V” for valor under fire. His military career, marked by extraordinary bravery, was also shadowed by post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ). ""Just some concussions,"" he told his ex-girlfriend, Alicia Arritt, in text messages, downplaying the trauma of combat, reported AP.Arritt, a former Army nurse, recalled how Livelsberger spoke of the exhaustion and sleepless nights that followed him home. ""He kept reliving the violence,"" she said. The soldier's anguish was reflected in a graphic tattoo he shared with her—two skulls pierced by bullets, symbolizing the lives he took in Afghanistan.Livelsberger and Arritt met in 2018 through a dating app. Their shared military background created a bond, with Arritt often serving as his confidant. She described him as a man deeply affected by the horrors of war but hesitant to seek help due to the stigma within his Special Forces unit. "" Mental health was seen as a weakness,"" she said.Despite his struggles, Livelsberger recently reached out for treatment for depression through the Army, according to an anonymous US official. However, the toll of years of silent suffering was apparent.In his final days, Livelsberger reconnected with Arritt, sending her cheerful messages and videos of the Tesla Cybertruck he would later use in the explosion. Arritt believes his actions carried symbolic meaning. ""He felt things very deeply, and I could see him using the truck and the location as a metaphor,"" she said.Authorities confirmed that the explosion was not a terrorist act. In notes left behind, Livelsberger referred to his death as a ""wakeup call"" and a way to ""cleanse the demons"" of war.Arritt, who treated traumatic brain injuries during her Army service, recognized symptoms of memory loss and withdrawal in Livelsberger early on. ""He struggled, but he hid it well,"" she said. She also lamented the military’s failure to provide timely mental health support.On January 1, Livelsberger detonated the Cybertruck, which was loaded with fireworks, fuel, and mortar rounds, before taking his own life. Seven people were injured in the explosion.","Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, 37, died by suicide in a Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day.

Hate-driven crime

In a haunting phone call recorded days after Blaze Bernstein went missing in January 2018, his father Gideon Bernstein reached out to Samuel Woodward, the last person known to have seen his son alive. The exchange, marked by apparent concern from Woodward, later unravelled as a chilling piece of evidence in a case that revealed hate, violence, and deception.Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old pre-med student at the University of Pennsylvania, disappeared while visiting his family in Lake Forest, California, during winter break. On January 3, 2018, Blaze had gone out to meet Woodward, a former high school classmate, after connecting on social media. When Blaze failed to return home, leaving behind his glasses, wallet, and packed bags for his return to college, his family grew alarmed.In desperation, Blaze’s father used social media to track Woodward and initiated a phone call, which his daughter Beaue recorded. According to, Gideon told Woodward, “We haven’t heard from him all day. He missed an appointment today, and then we started getting concerned. You’re the first real clue to the puzzle here.”Woodward responded with apparent empathy, saying, “Yeah, I feel like [expletive], honestly, I’m sorry. I want to find Blaze as much as you do.” He went on to describe their evening, claiming Blaze suggested meeting another friend at Borrego Park. According to Woodward, Blaze walked off into the night, leaving him waiting by a restroom.The story raised more questions than answers. As Blaze’s family pressed for clarity, their instincts led them to alert authorities, who soon placed Woodward under surveillance.Six days after Blaze went missing, his body was found in a shallow grave at Borrego Park. The brutal nature of his death shocked investigators and the community. Blaze had been stabbed multiple times in the face, neck, and knee, with defensive wounds indicating a desperate fight for his life.Woodward was brought in for questioning and later arrested. Asreported, a search of his home uncovered evidence tying him to violent neo-Nazi ideologies, including a bloodstained mask, knife, and anti-gay and anti-Semitic materials.Prosecutors contended that Woodward’s actions were motivated by hate, presenting evidence of his association with the Atomwaffen Division , a neo-Nazi extremist group. They argued that Woodward targeted Blaze because he was gay and Jewish, a claim Woodward denied.In court, Woodward’s defence shifted blame to personal struggles, including a diagnosis of autism and confusion about his sexuality. His attorney claimed the killing was a panicked reaction to a perceived invasion of privacy, alleging without evidence that Blaze was attempting to photograph him during an intimate moment.Woodward was convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement in July 2024 and sentenced to life without parole in November. Blaze’s parents, Jeanne Pepper Bernstein and Gideon Bernstein, expressed relief at the outcome but noted the enduring pain of losing their son.“While he rots in prison, we will be here on the outside, celebrating the life of Blaze,” Jeanne said during the sentencing.","Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old pre-med student at the University of Pennsylvania, disappeared while visiting his family in Lake Forest, California, during winter break.

Dramatic speaker vote: Trump pushes Johnson to victory but challenges loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dramatic-speaker-vote-trump-pushes-johnson-to-victory-but-challenges-loom/articleshow/116943016.cms,"In a dramatic turn of events, President-elect Donald Trump played a pivotal role in securing the speaker’s post for Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson. With just two Republican lawmakers, Representatives Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas, standing in the way, Trump stepped in from the golf course Friday afternoon to personally convince them to support Johnson, CNN reported.The intervention proved crucial as Johnson ultimately secured the 218 votes needed to retain the speaker's position and lead a narrowly divided chamber into the new year. While the official record shows that Johnson achieved the required votes on the first attempt, the outcome was uncertain until the last moment, highlighting the political drama and the influence Trump continues to wield over the Republican Party.Two sources familiar with the conversation revealed that Trump urged the lawmakers to prioritize party unity, warning that voters would have little patience for the dysfunction that could arise if Republicans failed to rally behind a single speaker, CNN reported.This episode highlighted the significant challenges President-elect Donald Trump would face in governing over the next two years, despite Republicans controlling both the White House and Congress.With narrow majorities in the House and Senate, Trump will require near-unanimous support from his party or bipartisan cooperation to fulfill the sweeping changes he promised voters. Failing to secure this could impede his ability to deliver on his agenda.The situation will become even more precarious if the Senate confirms Reps. Mike Waltz of Florida and Elise Stefanik of New York to serve in the administration as national security adviser and United Nations ambassador, respectively, which would further reduce the Republican margin in the House.These difficulties are compounded by the struggles House Republicans have faced since regaining the majority in 2022, underscoring the challenges Trump will need to overcome to maintain party unity and achieve his policy goals.“Governing is messy sometimes,” Republican Representative Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told CNN. “And I think we’ve proven that not only today, but over the last two years.

Prior to the holiday break, he attempted but failed to convince House Republicans to increase the country's borrowing limit during a funding vote that nearly led to a government shutdown.Trump’s influence within his party has faced several setbacks. His allies were unable to sway the vote for the next Senate majority leader, a position that went to South Dakota Sen John Thune, a former critic of the incoming president.Additionally, Trump couldn’t convince Florida Gov Ron DeSantis to appoint his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to the Senate seat currently held by Marco Rubio, whom Trump has selected as secretary of state. Trump also abandoned efforts to appoint former Rep Matt Gaetz as attorney general due to strong opposition from Senate Republicans.However, securing Mike Johnson’s victory marked an important early test of Trump’s ability to navigate a closely divided chamber, where individual lawmakers hold significant power.","President-elect Donald Trump played a pivotal role in securing the speaker’s post for Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson.

Cybertruck explosion in Vegas: Green beret Matthew Livelsberger left note calling it 'wake-up call for US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cybertruck-explosion-in-vegas-green-beret-matthew-livelsberger-left-note-calling-it-wake-up-call-for-us/articleshow/116955823.cms,"Matthew Livelsberger who served in the US military since 2006, called his act a wake-up call for the US. According to the authorities, Livelsberger, a US Army Green Beret, suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

The final note: A call to arms?

Behind the explosion: A troubled soldier's last act

Symbolism or spectacle?

A nation divided

A fiery explosion outside Trump International Hotel on New Year’s Day, involving a Cybertruck and a decorated Green Beret, has left behind a note that paints a complex portrait of a man battling inner demons while issuing a dire warning to the nation.Matthew Livelsberger , 37, blew himself up in a rented Tesla Cybertruck outside the Las Vegas landmark, injuring seven bystanders and sparking immediate speculation over his motives. However, a handwritten note found on his iPhone sheds light on the incident, with Livelsberger emphatically stating: “This was not a terrorist attack. It was a wake-up call.”In his note, Livelsberger described the US as “terminally ill” and accused its leaders of enriching themselves at the nation’s expense. “Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence,” he wrote. “What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives?”Directly addressing fellow service members and veterans, Livelsberger pleaded: “TIME TO WAKE UP! We are being led by weak and feckless leadership.” Despite the explosive location—outside a Trump-branded hotel—and the high-profile Cybertruck used in the act, Livelsberger expressed no animosity toward Trump, whom family members say he supported.The FBI revealed Livelsberger was the sole fatality in the blast, which he orchestrated with chilling precision. Before igniting the vehicle, he inserted a handgun into his mouth and pulled the trigger, moments before the Cybertruck erupted. Law enforcement also dispelled conspiracy theories, confirming that the vehicle was not set to self-driving mode.Livelsberger’s family told investigators that he was a “patriotic American” and a Trump supporter. Yet, his note points to deeper personal struggles, including PTSD, guilt from combat, and recent heartbreak. Reports surfaced that his second wife had left him days before the explosion.An ex-girlfriend revealed he had suffered a traumatic brain injury during his service in Afghanistan, which led to memory loss, relationship challenges, and guilt over battlefield actions.The choice of a Cybertruck—a symbol of Elon Musk ’s tech revolution—and the Trump hotel fueled speculation of political undertones. Yet Livelsberger’s note muddies these waters, suggesting a broader frustration with American society and governance.“This wasn’t just a cry for help,” a senior FBI official told reporters. “It was a deliberate, symbolic act aimed at sending a message to a divided nation.”As investigations continue, Livelsberger’s actions have sparked debates on mental health among veterans, the state of American politics, and the desperate lengths to which some go to be heard.While the explosion outside the glitzy Trump International Hotel may fade from headlines, the question remains: Was Livelsberger’s dramatic act a wake-up call—or just another moment lost in the noise of America’s spectacle-driven culture?","Matthew Livelsberger, 37, blew himself up in a rented Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day.

A soldier's burden

Matthew Livelsberger , a decorated Special Forces soldier, sought treatment for depression in the months leading up to a shocking suicide bombing involving a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas this week. The 37-year-old, who reportedly battled PTSD, guilt from combat, and family issues, had expressed a desire to seek further help, according to his ex-girlfriend, Army nurse Alicia Arritt.“He wanted to get more help,” said Arritt, 39, who dated Livelsberger from 2018 to 2021. “I think it was even harder for him, being on active duty — the shame and the stigma,” reported New York Post.Livelsberger left a haunting note in his charred cellphone, recovered after the explosion, which read: “I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.” FBI officials noted on Friday that Livelsberger “likely” suffered from PTSD and had ongoing “family issues.”Despite attending three mental health counseling sessions between August and December, it remains unclear whether he was assessed as a risk for suicide or violence.Arritt revealed that Livelsberger, proud of his nearly two decades in the military, had suffered multiple concussions during combat and undergone back surgery due to injuries sustained from parachute jumps. Still, he struggled with sleeping, focusing, and maintaining relationships.Livelsberger left his Colorado home on December 26 after his wife, with whom he shared a baby daughter, left him over cheating allegations, according to sources. He then rented a Tesla Cybertruck through the Turo app and drove to Las Vegas. Hours before the explosion, video footage from the vehicle’s cameras captured him calmly clearing dirt off the bumper while wearing a T-shirt with the logo of fireworks manufacturer Black Cat.On January 1, Livelsberger packed the Cybertruck with explosives and fireworks before shooting himself in the head and triggering the blast. Several people in the hotel’s valet area sustained injuries from the explosion.Arritt, who treated veterans with brain injuries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, described Livelsberger as a man burdened by his military service. She recalled asking him about his injuries when they first met, to which he replied, “Just some concussions.”Livelsberger had also emailed claims about national security threats before his death. In an email revealed on The Shawn Ryan Podcast, the soldier alleged that federal officials were working with China to develop drones, which he called “the most dangerous threat to national security.” Officials are still verifying the email’s legitimacy.Federal authorities ruled out any link between Livelsberger’s bombing and another New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans. In that incident, ISIS-affiliated ex-soldier Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a truck into a Bourbon Street crowd, killing 14 people before being shot dead by police.Livelsberger’s tragic story highlights the challenges faced by veterans struggling with mental health issues and the lasting impact of combat trauma . His ex-girlfriend reflected, “He was so proud of his service, but I think it came with a lot of guilt. He carried a heavy burden, and he wanted to make it right.”The FBI continues to investigate the incident and Livelsberger’s final days.","Matthew Livelsberger, a decorated Special Forces soldier, sought treatment for depression in the months leading up to his suicide bombing.

Authorities soon identified Jorgenson, her boyfriend, as a suspect. He had been seen on surveillance footage leaving Starren's apartment with duffle bags and a suitcase.

PESHAWAR: Gunmen ambushed a Pakistan convoy travelling to bring aid to a region besieged by sectarian fighting on Saturday, local government said, wounding several officials despite a ceasefire announced three days ago.The Kurram region of northwest Pakistan has been wracked by Sunni-Shiite violence for decades, but around 200 people have been killed since a fresh bout of fighting broke out in November.As feuding tribes have battled with machine guns and heavy weapons, the remote and mountainous region bordering Afghanistan has been largely cut off from the outside world.After a truce was called on January 1, the convoy was attacked as it travelled to collect the first aid delivery of food and medicine sent by road since November, officials said.Kurram's deputy commissioner was wounded ""along with two other administration officials, two policemen and two Frontier Corps soldiers"", local government official Motasim Billah told AFP.He said the attack took place around 11.00 am (0600 GMT).The deputy commissioner ""came under an attack by unidentified miscreants"" but his ""condition is out of danger"" according to Muhammad Ali Saif, the spokesman of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.""The convoy has been temporarily halted due to security concerns,"" he added in a statement.Numerous ceasefires have been touted by the provincial government since the latest fighting broke out, only to be broken with renewed clashes hours later.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement the attack was ""a conspiracy"" intended to undo the ceasefire agreed on New Year's Day following a council of tribal leaders from both sides.""Mischievous elements carried out the firing to harm the peace agreement,"" he said in a statement.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country but Shiites make up between 10 and 15 percent of the population.The communities live side-by-side in Kurram, but feuding is regularly re-sparked over land disputes before igniting along sectarian divides.This current round of violence started in November when two separate convoys of Shiite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, with 40 people killed.",Kurram region of northwest Pakistan has been wracked by Sunni-Shiite violence for decades.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136.

Under the peace agreement, both sides have agreed on the demolition of bunkers and the handover of heavy weapons to the authorities.“Both sides will give a coordinated plan of action within 15 days for the collection of weapons,” Saif said, adding that bunkers already existing in the area will be dismantled within a month.After the demolition of bunkers, according to the official, any party that launches an attack will be considered a “terrorist” and action will be taken against it.Another provision of the peace agreement states that anybody who violates the terms of the agreement by employing weapons against the other would face a Pakistani Rs 10 million ($35,933) fine.

cross-border militancy

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.
