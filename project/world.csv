The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI.

He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people.

This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries.

But courage can be contagious, too. That, too, is what it means to be an American...If you're at home and you disagree with everything I just said, our message to you is this: We will still defend to the death your right to say it, because that is who we are as Americans,"" said Ramaswamy, who had exited the presidential race earlier this year.He highlighted the opportunity for Americans to hold differing opinions yet come together peacefully, stating, ""We are the country where we can disagree like hell and still get together at the dinner table at the end of it.

That is the America we miss.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to Ramaswamy's remarks, ""Well said!!""on his X handle.Ramaswamy emphasised the US's potential for growth, asserting, ""we don't need to be a nation in decline,"" and that it can still be a ""nation in ascent"" with its best days ahead.He elaborated that in the US, people can succeed based on their hard work and dedication irrespective of their identity or background.

That is what still gives hope to the free world,"" Ramaswamy stated.He added, ""And if we can revive that dream over group identity, victimhood, and grievance, then nobody in the world, not a nation, not a corporation, not a virus, not China, is going to defeat us. That is what American exceptionalism is all about. And that is what we will revive this November when we send Donald J Trump back to the White House.""Earlier in the day, the 38-year-old addressed the issue of illegal immigration, promising firm action. ""Our message to illegal immigrants is also this; we will return you to your country of origin. Not because you're all bad people, but because you broke the law, and the United States of America was founded on the rule of law,"" he declared.Ramaswamy also pledged to seal the southern border on the first day if they came to power.Speaking directly to black Americans, he sought to counter media perceptions about Republican neglect. ""The media has tried to convince you for decades that Republicans don't care about your communities. We want for you what we want for every American: safe neighborhoods, clean streets, good jobs, a better life for your children, and a justice system that treats everyone equally - regardless of your skin color or your political beliefs,"" he said.","Ramaswamy emphasised the US's potential for growth, asserting, ""we don't need to be a nation in decline,"" and that it can still be a ""nation in ascent"" with its best days ahead.

TOI

CHENNAI: Exposing more tentacles of the gold smuggling racket at Chennai airport , government has suspended an undisclosed number of immigration officials for their suspected links with the smugglers .A top Intelligence Bureau official said three of the officials had been placed under suspension. But airport sources toldthat many more officers have faced action.“The number is being under-reported to avoid scrutiny of the immigration section by other agencies such as Directorate of Revenue intelligence (DRI) and Customs ,” an official said.The charge against the suspended personnel is that, for a cut from the smugglers, they collected gold from carriers arriving at the airport and sneaked it outside to receivers. They are also accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.An IB officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the nexus of the three officers with gold smugglers was being probed. One of them is Saravanan, who was on deputation to the IB. The officer refused to name the other two. “Action is being taken for the charges against them as mentioned in the memo,” he said.The officer said the suspension procedure was initiated only for internal procedural lapses. “We got intelligence that they allow flyers without verification of documents under the Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) category. How long they have been doing this and the money trail are being probed. If their involvement in gold smuggling had been proved, they would have been booked by now,” he said.The officer said the suspension orders were issued before Customs busted a cartel that smuggled in 267kg gold, worth about Rs 167 crore, in about two months. They used a souvenir shop as a front at the international terminal.Officials said they have detected similar offences in the past and suspended erring personnel. At least 45 immigration personnel, including many state police personnel on deputation to IB, are deployed at the airport for clearing international passengers.","Officials accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.

Yorkshire police assured complete investigation



Reactions from Officials



Major riots broke out in Leeds, UK, with protesters overturning police vehicle and setting double-decker bus on fire.West Yorkshire Police reported that they were dispatched to Luxor Street, Harehills , at 5 pm on Thursday in response to an ongoing incident. Upon arrival, officers ""found an ongoing disturbance which involved some agency workers and some children.""As a crowd began to gather, the officers decided to relocate the agency workers and children to a safer location.However, the situation escalated, and ""pockets of disorder"" emerged in the area.Social media posts allegedly showed a sizable crowd gathered on the street, with a police car being overturned and a bus being set on fire.Reports suggest that the riots were triggered by a protest following the removal of four children from a family by social services. One of the children had been taken to the hospital for treatment of an injury inflicted by a sibling. Local media reports indicate that the hospital authorities informed social services about the incident, leading to the children being removed from the family, which in turn sparked the protests.Police arrived to find an ongoing disturbance. By 9 pm, no uniformed officers were visible at the main disturbance site, although a police helicopter monitored the situation from above. Yorkshire police promised a thorough investigation into all criminal activities, including property damage caused by fires, and emphasised their commitment to holding those responsible accountable. ""We want to emphasise that those responsible will face the full consequences of the law,"" said the police.Tom Riordan, chief executive of the Leeds City Council, said calm was restored by about 1 am and authorities have already begun to clean up the damage.“There was a family incident earlier in the day that the police attended and our officials attended that a lot of the community got concerned about,” Riordan said in an interview with the BBC. “And that appeared to be the trigger of concern for groups of people being concerned about what had happened.”Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, expressed gratitude to emergency services in a social media post and urged those escalating tensions to reconsider their actions. She noted that no serious injuries had been reported. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the violence, stating that such disorder has no place in society. Councillor Salma Arif of Gipton and Harehills urged residents to remain indoors in a video statement, confirming that police were managing the situation. ""There is an ongoing situation currently in Harehills, we’re aware of that so police are here. We are asking everybody in the area to please stay at home at this moment in time,"" she said.","Major riots broke out in Leeds, UK, with protesters overturning police vehicle and setting double-decker bus on fire.

Who was Ukrainian linguist Iryna Farion?

Iryna Farion , a former Ukrainian nationalist politician known for speaking out in defense of the Ukrainian language and against the use of Russian , has been shot dead in Lviv , Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko announced in the early hours of Saturday.Farion was shot in the head outside her home on Friday evening by an unknown gunman. She later died from her injuries at a local hospital.Klymenko said that authorities were examining multiple theories to explain the killing.""The main theories currently under consideration are personal animosity, social and political activities of Ms Farion. We do not rule out the possibility that it was a contract killing,"" Klymenko wrote on the Telegram messaging service.Lviv Regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said that Farion had died after being taken to hospital.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the killing and ordered Klymenko and Security Service chief Vasyl Maliuk to solve the crime.He said that all lines of inquiry were being investigated, ""including one leading to Russia.""The Svoboda party, of which Farion was a member, blamed Moscow for the death in a statement without providing evidence.Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russian state broadcaster RT, celebrated the killing but did not claim Moscow was responsible for it.""Iryna Farion, who dreamed of the 'complete elimination' of the Russian-speaking population, has been eliminated,"" Simonyan said in a post on Telegram.Russian President Vladimir Putin cited the defense of Ukraine's Russian-speaking and ethnic Russian population as one of Moscow's war aims when he launched the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Farion served as a deputy for the far-right Svoboda party in Ukraine's parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada, from 2012 to 2014.She was known for statements in defense of the Ukrainian language and criticizing the widespread use of Russian in Ukrainian society, including by officials and soldiers.Ukrainian is the country's only official language but substantial sections of the population, especially in Ukraine's south and east, speak Russian as their primary language.Farion was herself from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which is predominantly Ukrainian-speaking.Following student protests, she temporarily lost her position as a Ukrainian language professor at the University of Lviv, but was reinstated following a court ruling.She had criticized the fact that members of Ukraine's Azov regiment continued speaking their mother tongue, Russian.The ultranationalist Azov militia was integrated into the Ukrainian military in 2014 and was a major force in the defense of the city of Mariupol in the eastern Donetsk region. The city was captured by Russian troops in May 2022 following a siege lasting nearly three months.","Iryna Farion was shot in the head outside her home in Lviv, Ukraine.

RNC LIVE: Trump gives speech at Republican National Convention Day 4

Donald Trump , the Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday recounted his personal experience of the assassination attempt on his life during a rally at Pennsylvania rally.While delivering his speech at the closing night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump called for unity among Americans.Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.He shared the details of the incident, stating, ""I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the bullet would have perfectly hit its mark. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.""Trump said that the attack was swiftly ended by a Secret Service sniper, who took out the assassin with a single shot from a greater distance.“There was blood pouring everywhere, yet, in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,"" Trump said. “I'm not supposed to be here tonight.""The crowd responded with chants of ""Yes you are,"" to which Trump replied, ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a 'providential moment.' Probably was.""In the face of the assassination attempt, Trump described how he raised his fist in the air and began shouting ""fight, fight, fight,"" demonstrating his resilience and determination to continue his presidential campaign.Trump's speech served as the culmination of a four-day Republican rally that attracted thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to Wisconsin, a crucial swing state.With both candidates currently facing low popularity, Trump seized the opportunity presented by his near-death experience to adopt a new tone that he believes will generate more momentum in an election that seems to be shifting in his favor.Meanwhile, 81-year-old Democrat Biden faces mounting pressure from key congressional allies, donors, and even former President Barack Obama , who are concerned about his ability to secure reelection following his poor debate performance.","Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.

Pelosi delivers speech to NC Democrats with notable absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pelosi-delivers-speech-to-nc-democrats-with-notable-absence-bidens-future-as-nominee/articleshow/111896329.cms,"RALEIGH NC: In a state expected to help decide the presidency, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi did little to quell speculation on President Joe Biden 's path forward as the Democratic nominee to a room full of North Carolina Democrats on Saturday.Pelosi addressed more than 900 people at the North Carolina Democratic Party fundraiser in Raleigh - an event billed as the annual ""Unity Dinner"" during a time of significant national discord over how the party will proceed in the 2024 presidential election .All eyes are on Democratic leaders like Pelosi, who colleagues say has her finger on the party's pulse, to get a glimpse of what Biden's future holds.The power she holds in the Democratic Party - and in the direction the party takes - was no better emphasized than in her introduction by US Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C.""When Nancy Pelosi speaks, everybody listens,"" Adams said.And with everybody listening, Pelosi gave a speech largely absent of mentions to Biden's presidential bid.Pelosi spent most of her speech recounting battles over budget and policy in the US House, highlighting the importance of funding public education and reiterating the dangers of the Republican agenda. When she did mention Biden, it was mostly to tout his administration's policies.At the end of her speech, Pelosi shifted to discussing the party's plans in the coming months and chose to focus on Democratic mobilization efforts rather than who to mobilize behind.""Are you ready for a Democratic president?"" Pelosi said amid cheers. ""I thought so.""Since Biden's dismal showing in the June 27 debate with former Republican President Donald Trump, significant fallout has ensued within the Democratic Party on whether the president is capable of defeating Trump.The former speaker is among a growing group of prominent Democratic leaders who have expressed concerns behind closed doors on Biden's ability to win in November. Pelosi told Biden in private that Democrats may fail to control the House if he doesn't drop out, but she later said her conversations were misrepresented.Despite a swell of Democratic lawmakers calling for Biden to drop out, none of North Carolina's seven Democratic representatives have publicly signaled support for finding a new nominee to lead the ticket.While some reports say Biden is more open to the idea of leaving the race in private discussions, his campaign staff has continually reaffirmed his commitment to staying in as the nominee.Brenda Pollard, a Durham delegate who has attended five Democratic conventions, said she's had conversations with Democrats around the state who want Biden to stay in.""As a pledged delegate, until he says 'I'm not,' I'm going to continue to be pledged,"" the 73-year-old said, adding later that she felt Vice President Kamala Harris has the qualifications to be president if Biden dropped out.About 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris has the makings of a good president, according to a recent AP-NORC Center poll.North Carolina is also home to one of the most hotly contested gubernatorial races in the country, pitting Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. The latter has become known for his similar, brash politicking style to Trump, which has made Robinson a lightning rod for criticism about statements some have found offensive and harmful.To reiterate the stakes of his race, Stein told the audience that voters have a choice between ""two competing visions"" in a competitive election - one that he said North Carolina will play a large role in deciding.""People in other states hunger for the kind of power that we have here in North Carolina. To possess this political power is a privilege,"" Stein said.Stein did not mention Biden, but instead wrapped up his speech saying Democrats will ""keep the White House and defeat Donald Trump.""Met by a standing ovation, Gov. Roy Cooper also took the stage, saying Biden and Harris are ""all in for North Carolina."" But most of his speech highlighted other issues, such as breaking the GOP legislative supermajority and getting Democrats in other statewide offices.Cooper has become part of the national conversation on the presidential race, as pundits consider who could be Harris' running mate if Biden leaves the race. Cooper's status as a term-limited governor, as well as his strong support of the Biden-Harris administration, has piqued some interest on his prospects.","House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi spoke at the North Carolina Democratic Party's annual ""Unity Dinner"" Pelosi did little to quell speculation on President Joe Biden's path forward as the Democratic nominee.

We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.”The spokesperson also confirmed that Secret Service Director Kimberly A Cheatle will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Monday regarding the failures leading up to the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.“The Secret Service is fully accountable for the safety of its protectees. We are committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Trump to ensure it never happens again,” he added.Since the assassination bid, Trump's security has been significantly increased. At a recent event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump and his new running mate, Ohio Sen JD Vance were greeted by around 14,000 supporters with an unprecedented level of police presence ensuring their safety.","The Secret Service initially denied claims that someone from Trump’s camp had asked for more help ahead of the deadly shooting.

She's as crazy as a bed bug.""Trump's rally tactics remained unchanged, despite briefly calling for national unity earlier in the week.Security measures were heightened at the Grand Rapids rally, with a heavy police presence and Secret Service officers positioned throughout the venue.Trump appeared alongside his new vice presidential pick, senator JD Vance from Ohio, following the Republican nominating convention in Milwaukee, where the party united behind them.In contrast, uncertainty surrounds Biden's position as the Democratic Party's nominee for the upcoming election. Some senior Democrats have called for Biden to end his re-election bid due to concerns about his ability to defeat Trump or complete another term. Trump capitalized on this, claiming that Democrats want to remove Biden from the ticket despite his victory in the nominating contest.Trump referred to the assassination attempt several times during the rally, expressing his hope that he would not have to go through such a horrible experience again. Opinion polls indicate a close race between Trump and Biden at the national level, with Biden trailing in crucial battleground states.Trump's former physician, Ronny Jackson, provided an update on the former president's recovery from the gunshot wound to his right ear, noting intermittent bleeding and the possibility of requiring a hearing test.

"Trump campaign releases letter on his injury, treatment after last week's assassination attempt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-campaign-releases-letter-on-his-injury-treatment-after-last-weeks-assassination-attempt/articleshow/111895645.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump's campaign released an update on the former president's health Saturday, one week after he survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.The memo, from Texas representative Ronny Jackson , a staunch supporter who served as Trump's White House physician, offers new details on the nature of the GOP nominee's injuries and the treatment he received in the immediate aftermath of the attack.It is the most thorough accounting to date of the former president's condition since the night of the shooting, which also left one rally-goer dead and injured two others.According to Jackson, Trump sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear that came ""less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear.""The bullet track, he said, ""produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear. There was initially significant bleeding, followed by marked swelling of the entire upper ear.""While the swelling has resolved and the wound ""is beginning to granulate and heal properly,"" he said Trump is still experiencing intermittent bleeding, requiring the dressing that was on display at last week's Republican National Convention.""Given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required,"" Jackson wrote.Trump was initially treated by medical staff at Butler Memorial Hospital. According to Jackson, doctors ""provided a thorough evaluation for additional injuries that included a CT of his head.""Trump, he said, ""will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, as needed. He will follow up with his primary care physician, as directed by the doctors that initially evaluated him,"" he wrote.""In summary, former President Trump is doing well, and he is recovering as expected from the gunshot wound sustained last Saturday afternoon,"" he added.Jackson said in the letter that, as Trump's former doctor, he was worried and traveled to Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump had flown late Saturday after he returned from Pennsylvania, ""to personally check on him, and offer my assistance in any way possible.""He said he has been with Trump since that time, evaluating and treating his wound daily, and would remain with Trump through the weekend, including traveling to Michigan, where Trump held his first rally since the shooting, joined by his new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. At Saturday's rally, the white gauze on Trump's ear was replaced by a skin-colored bandage.Jackson appears to be licensed to practice medicine in Florida, according to a state health department database. Records from the American Board of Emergency Medicine also show that Jackson has a certification in Emergency Medicine, valid through the end of 2025.A spokesperson for the congressman did not immediately provide a response when asked about the status of his license, and Trump campaign 's did not immediately respond to questions.Jackson has come under considerable scrutiny. After administering a physical to Trump in 2018, he drew headlines for extolling the then-president's ""incredibly good genes"" and suggesting that ""if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.""In 2001, the Department of Defense inspector general released a scathing report on his conduct as a top White House physician that found Jackson had made ""sexual and denigrating"" comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care.Jackson denied the allegations, claiming he was the victim of a ""political hit job"" because of his close ties to the former Republican president.Last year, Trump's campaign released a letter on President Joe Biden's 81st birthday from Dr. Bruce A. Aronwald, a New Jersey physician, who said he had been the former president's doctor since 2021.Trump's campaign and federal law enforcement had released little information on his condition or treatment in the days after the the attack, declining to disclose medical records or hold briefings with the doctors who treated him at the hospital.After a would-be assassin shot and gravely wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the Washington, D.C., hospital where he was treated gave regular, detailed public updates about his condition and treatment.Trauma surgeon Babak Sarani, who said he has been treating more patients with wounds from AR-15 style assault rifles, said the description in the letter was ""exactly in line with what you would expect from a bullet wound.""While the indirect damage is still usually minor, he said the risk of extensive damage is greater than if another gun were used.""If a bullet whizzes by your ear from a low-caliber handgun, it's not a big deal. ... You get a headache or feel dizzy like a bad concussion,"" said Sarani, chief of trauma at George Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C. ""But if the bullet is from an assault rifle, the energy is bigger, broader, and you're more likely to develop bruises.""He added, ""in Trump's case, he got very lucky. The majority of the energy was released in the air. If it had hit him in the head, we would be having a completely different conversation.""Former Secret Service agent Rich Staropoli said the AR-15-style rifle used by the gunman fires a 5.56 millimeter bullet at such high speeds - over 2,000 miles an hour - that just the air pressure as it passes can cause extensive damage.""The shock wave alone could have ripped his ear off,"" Staropoli said of Trump. ""It's amazing the bullet nipped him"" and didn't do any other damage.""It's a one in a billion type of thing,"" he added. A fraction of a millimeter closer, ""and this would be a different story. It really is incredible the thin line here between just a nick and devastating bodily damage.""","Ronny Jackson, who served as Trump's White House physician, wrote the letter. The bullet came ""less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head,"" he said. The swelling has resolved and the wound ""is beginning to granulate and heal,"" Jackson said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895688,imgsize-1167088,width-400,resizemode-4/111895688.jpg"

In a video released on Wednesday, Harris said, ""Make no mistake: JD Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country,"" as reported by ABC News.The Michigan rally marked Vance's first appearance with Trump since being selected as his running mate. It also was Trump's first rally following an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania the previous week.During the rally, Vance rejected media claims that Trump and the Republican agenda are ""radical"" and ""dangerous,"" receiving a warm welcome from supporters in Michigan, according to CNN.Notably, Vance's family did not attend the rally. He mentioned that his wife, Usha, was taking their children, aged 7, 4, and 2, ""out on the town"" in Grand Rapids.Former President Trump, returning to the campaign trail days after accepting the Republican nomination for president at the Republican National Convention, wore a smaller, beige-colored bandage on his ear.

The crowd responded with chants of ""Fight, fight, fight!"" as Trump stood before them, his ear bandage now replaced with a skin-colored one.Vance, who joined Trump for their first joint appearance since being nominated at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, remarked on the incredible turnout despite the recent assassination attempt.""I find it hard to believe that a week ago, an assassin tried to take Donald Trump's life, and now we have got a hell of a crowd in Michigan to welcome him back on the campaign trail,"" he said.Trump, in turn, praised Vance, saying, ""I chose him because he's for the worker.""In a triumphant declaration to an enthusiastic audience, Donald Trump said, ""Last week I took a bullet for democracy."" The former president vehemently denied any extremist affiliations, refuting alleged connections to Project 2025, a controversial manifesto spearheaded by his close associates.Critics have denounced the project as a far-right, authoritarian agenda.Trump also took aim at the Democratic Party, which is grappling with unprecedented calls for US President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race due to concerns about his age and ability to effectively serve until 2029 if reelected.The former president mockingly remarked, ""They have no idea who their candidate is... This guy goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That's democracy.""Despite occasionally lapsing into his signature meandering campaign rhetoric, the rally marked a remarkable moment by any standard, as Trump returned to the stage precisely one week after an assailant attempted to assassinate him.

The iconic red ""Make America Great Again"" hats were also a common sight among the crowd.The rally was held at the Van Andel Arena, an indoor venue capable of accommodating more than 12,000 people.

Local witnesses said the shots fired during the rally forced protesters to disperse. “Direct firing on peaceful protesters is state terrorism. The people of Bannu will continue their peaceful resistance with unity and consensus for peace,” said former senator Mushtaq Ahmed.Led by young activist Manzoor Pashteen, PTM is known for its strident criticism of Pakistan’s powerful military for its role in alleged enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings of rights activists and ethnic leaders, as well as the alleged mistreatment of the Pakhtun community by security forces.Pashteen posted on X that the Pakistani army had opened fire on what he described as a “peaceful protest.” The demonstration came in the wake of a militant attack on a military base in the area on July 15 in which eight soldiers were killed.Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns about cross-border attacks with the Taliban administration in Afghanistan, exacerbating tensions between the two countries.
