Good day in Indo-Pacific: US welcomes India-China deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/good-day-in-indo-pacific-us-welcomes-india-china-deal/articleshow/114556768.cms,"The United States has welcomed India’s LAC agreement with China that ended the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, with American ambassador Eric Garcetti saying the US has always supported India’s efforts to maintain its strategic interests and respect for its borders.The agreement had been endorsed by PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in their first official meeting in 5 years in Russia on Wednesday, with Modi saying stable relations between the 2 countries will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity.Amid speculation over how the US might react to the development, which could potentially at least lead to an India-China détente, Garcetti also told TOI, “India and the US want a calm world, without conflicts and threats and it’s a good day in the Indo-Pacific when any resolution of conflict is reached as in this breakthrough”.Indian officials have said in the past that Washington helped India with quick intelligence sharing, using US equipment, during the standoff. Garcetti mentioned the border agreement, which was announced by India on Monday, while talking about the possible role that India can play in bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to an end, especially after Modi’s back-to-back visits to Moscow and Kyiv in July and August. The ambassador was making the point that territorial integrity as a principle of international law is sacrosanct and applicable to all corners of the world.“We welcome the peacemakers, including PM Modi and minister Jaishankar. We welcome the focus on a war that isn’t only European but is global. You don’t have to be in eastern Europe to feel the impact of this war. Any human being should feel the impact of hundreds of thousands of lives lost in an unnecessary, unwarranted war of aggression that violated the most fundamental principles of international relations with respect to border,’’ said the ambassador.“As we celebrate the breakthrough at the LAC where India held a line on this principle, and we supported them, we believe that’s the principle not just for one part of the world but all parts of the world,’’ added Garcetti.While he welcomed India’s role as possible peacemaker in Ukraine, he also said playing that role isn’t easy as one has to spend political capitaland corner friends and enemies alike. “But if India can open more doors, help us all impress upon Russia the importance of peace and of non-aggression, then I think that’s a welcome engagement. As I always say, India sometimes opens doors we can’t, and we open doors when India can’t. That’s what makes this relationship so magical. At its very best, we are able to do things we can’t do on our own. Not just for each other, but for the world,’’ said Garcetti.Talking about India’s strategic autonomy in July this year, Garcetti had famously said that there’s no such thing in times of conflict. He continues to maintain though that his remarks were not linked to Modi’s visit to Russia, which had sparked a wave of outrage in the US and Europe for its timing.",US ambassador Eric Garcetti said the US has always supported India’s efforts to maintain its strategic interests and respect for its borders.

It was one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in the Union territory in 2024, following the June 9 ambush on a pilgrim bus in Reasi district of Jammu division, which killed nine people.Targeted violence against migrant workers has seen a troubling rise in Kashmir lately, evoking memories of 2022 when 29 fatalities were reported, including five Kashmiri Pandits.Earlier on Friday, the bullet-riddled body of a 30-year-old migrant worker from Bihar’s Banka district was found in a maize field in south Kashmir’s Shopian district.

‘

Brokenist

’ — Is that even a word?

Meme explosion: Trudeau’s linguistic faux pas

Fourth term drama: Will Trudeau run again?

Conservatives gain ground

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found himself the target of sharp jabs in Parliament on Wednesday, as he attempted to defend his government’s record on immigration . In the midst of a heated debate, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre tore into Trudeau, blaming him for the ongoing housing crisis , claiming the PM ""cannot fix what he broke because he’s busy fighting his own caucus.""But what really got people talking wasn’t the debate on policy — it was Trudeau’s unexpected vocabulary blunder.As Trudeau delivered a passionate rebuttal, he accused Poilievre of promoting a ""brokenist"" vision of Canada. The word instantly became the highlight of the day. Poilievre, with a grin, responded, “Mr Speaker, ‘brokenist,’ it’s not even a word. He’s even breaking the English language.”That quip set the internet on fire. Social media was ablaze with memes mocking the Prime Minister’s creative use of language. “Here we go, folks. ‘Brokenist,’ the latest addition to Trudeau’s dictionary,” one user joked on X (formerly known as Twitter). Another chimed in, “Did I miss a memo? Is ‘brokenist’ a thing now?”New Trudeau’s ‘brokenist’ moment quickly turned into meme material, with users having a field day mocking the PM’s slip-up. “From the most ‘brokenist’ PM we’ve ever had!” wrote one user, as another pointed out the irony of the leader who preaches fluency in two official languages accidentally coining a term that doesn’t exist. The ridicule didn’t stop there—“Dear Leader is so flustered, he makes no sense. This is the ‘brokenist’ he’s ever been,” a popular post read.But while the memes may be fun, the political landscape Trudeau faces is anything but. Adding to the PM’s woes, a significant number of his own party members have privately suggested he should bow out before the next election. A letter signed by more than 20 Liberal lawmakers urges Trudeau to step aside. His leadership, once seemingly untouchable, is now the subject of growing skepticism within the party.Although Trudeau didn’t address the internal rebellion directly after the meeting, he’s hinted he plans to run for an unprecedented fourth term. However, cracks are forming, with MPs like Charles Sousa saying Trudeau is ""reflecting"" on his future.With elections looming between now and October 2025, the Liberal Party 's future seems uncertain. Recent losses in key special elections in Toronto and Montreal, combined with polling numbers that show the Conservatives leading by 13 points, spell trouble for Trudeau. Conservative leader Poilievre’s sharp criticism may have hit harder than expected, resonating with a public increasingly disillusioned with the Liberals’ performance.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accidentally used the word ""brokenist"" in Parliament.

GOP pollster Mitchell Brown predicted that this year's election will see something that hasn't happened since 1988 and neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris will win all three key battleground states -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The GOP pollster said the trend line is great and in favor of Trump as North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada -- the other four swing states -- are good to go.But no candidate would likely win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- all three. ""If you look in 2016, Trump won all three of those states, obviously Biden won all three of those swing states...in 2020."" the pollster said. The winner of these three states often wins the presidency, with the exception being Democratic candidate Al Gore who won those three but lost to George W Bush.""What I see here, is that neither candidate would win all three of those, that means Trump just taking one—he has the election won,"" Brown said on Thursday.""I still believe that Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are the two most likely to fall for Trump, but if turnout is maximized and we see a repeat, it would be all three for Trump and zero for Kamala,"" the GOP pollster said.The polls have so far predicted a tight race between Harris and Trump projecting a tied race between the two. In 2016, Hilary Clinton was kept ahead of Donald Trump by the polls but in the end, Clinton was just 2 percent ahead in the popular vote while Trump won the Electoral College.Celebrated pollster Silver Nate said the battle is so far tied but his 'gut feeling' says it would be Donald Trump.

Watch video:

Politician Robert F Kennedy Jr urged the voters to vote for former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump if they wanted to avoid the nuclear war RFK Jr , who is endorsing Donald Trump for the upcoming US presidential election, on Thursday said that voting for Vice President and Democratic candidacy Kamala Harris is like voting for nuclear war.He gave several reasons to back his statement and claimed that Dick Cheney , who endorsed Harris, was the driving force on a group called the neocons which started the Iraq war in which the US launched an unprovoked attack in order to prevent Saddam Hussein from threatening the world with weapons of mass destruction.In a video message posted on X, RFK Jr said, ""If you want to avoid nuclear war, I strongly urge you to vote for Donald Trump. In fact, I would go so far as to say that a vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for nuclear war. Here are some of my reasons for saying that. Former vice president Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala and she said she was honored to have his approval. Dick Cheney was the driving force on a group called the neocons which started the Iraq war in which the US launched an unprovoked preemptive attack, the first in its history in order to prevent Saddam Hussein from threatening the world with weapons of mass destruction. """"As history now shows, there were no weapons of mass destruction. It was all a neocon lie. Most estimates are that over a million Iraqis died while the USA and allied forces suffered over 4800 deaths and over 32,000 wounded. We killed more Iraqis than Saddam Hussein ever did. This fraction of our military and intelligence establishment that we call the neacons, led by Dick Cheney faked the evidence of weapons of mass destruction because they wanted a war,"" he added.In his video message, he also recalled the 1961 incident when President Eisenhower warned the American people of the dangers of the emerging military industrial complex that would try to embroil the citizens in a nuclear war with Russia.Over the Operation Northwoods, RFK Jr pointed out that his uncle, President John F. Kennedy confronted his own joint chiefs of Staff and his intelligence officials who proposed to fake the shooting down of an American civilian airliner and blame it on Cuba in order to justify a nuclear war with Russia.""John Kennedy stood up to them and refused to go along. President Kennedy was shocked by another military proposal to launch a surprise nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. The uniform meant that the USA would win because the Soviets would suffer over 130 million deaths while in America only 30 million would die,"" he said.""After John Kennedy's assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin incident was used to justify war on Vietnam. It wasn't until almost 40 years later that it was shown conclusively to be untrue. The North Vietnamese did not attack our warships on August 4, 1964. War intelligence about the Gulf of Tonkin incident was faked because a fraction of our military industrial establishment wanted that war,"" he added.Expressing his concerns over today's situation, RFK Jr said that now that the US have a faction of military and intelligence establishments that desire war, they want a war right now with Russia over Ukraine. It is pertinent to mention that Russia is the largest nuclear power on earth, which has over a thousand more nuclear weapons and better than America's best weapons.Calling Kamala Harris' remarks about Russia during her acceptance speech at the democratic convention were ""extremely alarming"", RFK Jr said that Kamala Harris is inexperienced in foreign policy.He also said that those words demonstrated that Kamala would be a perfect pushover, a puppet of the military intelligence faction that wants this war.""We don't need a president who is so weak that she needs to prove her strength to the American people by sacrificing the life of American military personnel and foreign engagements abroad. Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he would negotiate with Putin to end the Ukraine war. If JFK were alive today, he would be standing side by side with President Trump on this issue,"" he said.""A recent study predicts that World War III will last only 73 minutes, and that in that time, 5.8 billion human beings will die. And as JFK said, those who survive a nuclear war will envy the dead. If what I've said here makes sense to you, I urge you to contribute to help me get this message to millions more of our fellow citizens. The election is right around the corner, and the danger is very real. Please donate as much as you can today,"" he added.",Politician Robert F Kennedy Jr urged the voters to vote for former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump.

What is fascism? And why does Harris say Trump is a fascist?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-fascism-and-why-does-harris-say-trump-is-a-fascist/articleshow/114565826.cms,"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump

Here's a closer look:

WASHINGTON: Vice President Kamala Harris was asked this week if she thought Donald Trump was a fascist, and she replied, ""Yes, I do."" She subsequently called him the same thing herself, saying voters don't want ""a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.""But what exactly is a fascist? And does the meaning of the word shift when viewed through a historical or political prism - especially so close to the end of a fraught presidential race?What is fascism ? An authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement.It is often associated with the far right and characterized by a dictatorial leader who uses military forces to help suppress political and civil opposition.History's two most famous fascists were Nazi chief Adolf Hitler in Germany and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Known as Il Duce, or ""the duke,"" Mussolini headed the National Fascist Party, which was symbolized by an eagle clutching a fasces - a bundle of rods with an axe among them.At Mussolini's urging, in October 1922, thousands of ""Blackshirts,"" or ""squadristi,"" made up an armed fascist militia that marched on Rome, vowing to seize power. Hitler's Nazis similarly relied on a militia, known as the ""Brownshirts."" Both men eventually imposed single-party rule and encouraged violence in the streets. They used soldiers, but also fomented civilian unrest that pit loyalists against political opponents and larger swaths of everyday society.Hitler and Mussolini censored the press and issued sophisticated propaganda. They played up racist fears and manipulated not just their active supporters but everyday citizens.Today, the term fascism has taken on a looser political definition and is often evoked as a catch-all for efforts to spread oppression and racism - as well as to decry dictators or leaders who embrace totalitarian tactics.It is not just the left that has used the term, denouncing a push rightward in the US and in many parts of the world. Some conservatives decried lockdowns imposed during the coronavirus pandemic as ""fascist.""What are other historical examples of fascism? Hitler and Mussolini are its two biggest names, but it gets murkier from there.Does military dictator Augusto Pinochet's 17-year, ironfisted rule in Chile qualify? What about Indonesian strongman Suharto or Spain's Francisco Franco? Were the regimes of Ferenc Szalasi in Hungary and Brazil's Plinio Salgado fascist? Where does American neo-Nazi leader David Duke fit?Indeed, critics sometimes describe modern US extremist groups - including movements that have cheered Trump, like the Proud Boys - as fascists or neo-fascists. Those labels may be more steeped in political ideology than clear historical parallels.Why is Harris calling Trump a fascist? The vice president has long criticized Trump as being mentally unstable and not a true believer in, or defender of, the nation's founding democratic principles.She notes that Trump suggested he'd deploy the military to target political opponents, including people he has decried as the ""enemy from within."" The former president has long talked about attacking his enemies and declared to his supporters that he would be their ""retribution.""""He's talking about the American people. He's talking about journalists, judges, nonpartisan election officials,"" Harris said Wednesday night at a CNN town hall.Trump has threatened to take action against television networks and news organizations for coverage he deems unfavorable. And, when now-President Joe Biden challenged him during a 2020 debate to denounce the Proud Boys, Trump replied: ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.""A mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to overturn Trump's loss to Biden after Trump gave a speech propagating falsehoods about the election and exhorting the crowd to ""fight like hell."" Among the people imprisoned in connection with Jan. 6 was the leader of the Proud Boys, accused of orchestrating a failed plot to keep Trump in power.Harris has been building toward the characterization. During an interview with her in Detroit on Oct. 15, radio host Charlamagne Tha God, said Trump was increasingly embracing fascism and asked, ""Why can't we just say it?"" ""Yes, we can say that,"" Harris replied.Then, Trump's longest-serving former chief of staff, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, warned that the former president meets the definition of a fascist. He said Trump, while in office, suggested that Hitler ""did some good things,"" and that Trump valued personal loyalty above the Constitution.Trump's campaign has accused Kelly of lying and brushed aside Harris' criticism, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responding, ""Kamala will say anything to distract from her open border invasion and record high inflation."" Trump has described Jan. 6 as a ""day of love.""Trump himself rejected the fascist label in an interview Thursday with Fox News.""Everyone knows that's not true,"" he said. ""They call me everything until something sticks.""How do experts on fascism view Trump? They are divided.Robert Paxton, a Columbia University professor emeritus who wrote ""The Anatomy of Fascism,"" has cited the Jan. 6 attack as evidence of Trump's fascism.""It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms,"" Paxton told The New York Times Magazine in a piece published this week. ""It's the real thing. It really is.""Some do not see Trump as meeting the classic historical definition of a fascist, but rather increasingly moving toward politics that have fascist tendencies.David Kertzer, a Brown University professor and Italian historian, said he was ""a little horrified"" to hear Harris call Trump a fascist given the term's ""historical resonance."" He said there are some similarities, including ""mass movement, a cult of the strongman."" He noted that Trump sometimes juts out his chin, though he isn't prone to tearing off his shirt and bare his chest, like Mussolini did.Kertzer said that fascism involved ""a one-party state, a banishing of all opposition newspapers and jailing people who disagreed,"" and that, while Trump has talked about jailing opponents, he's not moved toward embracing other key facets of the movement.""There are certain echoes, but in terms of turning the Republican Party into a one-party state, that seems rather farfetched at the moment,"" said Kertzer, author of ""The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe.""David Clay Large, a senior fellow at the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of European Studies, said ""the alarm bells now going off may be somewhat overblown.""""Our democratic institutions, however beleaguered, remain much stronger than those of the European nations that turned fascist in the '20s and '30s,"" Large said. Still, he added, there would be ""a real danger to these institutions"" in a second Trump presidential term.The rise of far-right parties across Europe and Trump's control of the GOP, Large said, carves out ""an entirely new situation: The center cannot hold as it once did.""Add to that mix social media, which in the digital age mirrors the use of propaganda, amping up emotions and division, he said.""Where everyone's an expert, we've lost respect for factuality, objectivity, and actual expert opinion,"" Large said.",Kamala Harris says Donald Trump admires dictators and is a fascist. The term has taken on a looser political definition. It is often evoked as a catch-all for efforts to spread oppression and racism. Critics sometimes describe modern US extremist groups as fascists or neo-fascists.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114565892,imgsize-1246622,width-400,resizemode-4/114565892.jpg"

SYDNEY: A restaurateur pleaded guilty to displaying a Nazi symbol during a pro-Palestinian rally in Sydney in early October.Alan Yazbek was photographed at the Oct. 6 rally in Sydney's central business district holding a sign that replaced the Star of David on the Israeli flag with a blue swastika, accompanied by the words “Stop Nazi Israel.”The 56-year-old Yazbek was also photographed holding another sign in the green and yellow colors associated with Hezbollah — a designated terrorist organization in Australia — with the words “our boys in green and gold will win.""The rally took place a day before the one-year anniversary of the Oct.7 attacks in Israel, carried out by Hamas.Yazbek — the co-founder of the Nomad Group, which owns three high-end restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne — was the only person charged following the rally, which saw an estimated 10,000 people in attendance. Police initially tried to prevent the rally but later reached an agreement with organizers, allowing it to proceed peacefully.Yazbek faces a potential sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of 11,000 Australian dollars ($7,300). He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 10.Performing Nazi gestures and displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika have been banned by various state and federal laws since 2022. Jewish groups in Australia have reported a significant rise in anti-Semitic actions as the conflict in the Middle East escalates.Earlier in October, an Australian state police chief was compelled to apologize to the Jewish community after a 65-year-old sergeant allegedly performed an outlawed Nazi salute at a police academy. In the same week, a self-described Nazi was told by a magistrate he would become the first person in Australia sentenced to prison for performing the same banned gesture.In June, three soccer fans were fined for performing the salute during a Sydney match. The men were the first convicted in Australia for such offenses and have lodged appeals.","Alan Yazbek was photographed at the Oct. 6 rally in Sydney's central business district holding a sign that replaced the Star of David on the Israeli flag with a blue swastika.

"A car bomb explodes outside a police station in western Mexico, wounding 3 officers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/a-car-bomb-explodes-outside-a-police-station-in-western-mexico-wounding-3-officers/articleshow/114565303.cms,"A car bomb explodes outside a police station in western Mexico, wounding 3 officers (AP Image)

ACAMBARO: A car bomb left outside a police station in the town of Acambaro in western Mexico wounded three people, prosecutors in the violence-wracked state of Guanajuato said Thursday.They said another explosion, apparently a second car bomb, occurred in the nearby town of Jerecuaro. Although nobody was wounded, the force of that second blast was enough to blow the tile roof off a building, blacken the facades of surrounding stores and set alight a police patrol pickup truck.The near-simultaneous attacks in two different towns located about a half-hour away from each other suggested the involvement of drug cartels that have been fighting bloody turf battles for years in Guanajuato.A resident who witnessed the aftermath of the blast in Acambaro said that among the injured was a woman and her daughter who were waiting for a bus. Authorities had said earlier that all of the three wounded were police officers.“A woman and a child were going to catch the school bus, and the woman was also seriously wounded,” said shopkeeper Francisca Acevedo.""They took her away in an ambulance.""Acevedo said “it was a big explosion, very strong. We thought a tree had fallen in front of the house.”And in another attack in Guerrero state, to the south, two municipal policemen were killed and four were wounded in a massive shootout with suspected drug cartel gunmen, who were equipped with three bullet-proof vehicles, a machine gun and what appeared to be bombs dropped by drones.Soldiers later killed 14 of the attackers; three soldiers were wounded in the running confrontation.Despite the violence, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged to continue the “hugs, not bullets” approach of her predecessor. Sheinbaum said Thursday she has ordered the army “not to have confrontations” with the cartels.“We are not going to return to a war against the narcos,” Sheinbaum said.But it takes two to tango, and her administration already appears to be locked in a war-like situation with the cartels in several states, whether she likes it or not, just three weeks after she took office.The car bomb in Acambaro was sizable enough to toss parts of the burnt-out car across a tree-lined median strip in the street outside the police station, according to photos distributed by the municipal police.The powerful blast apparently blew out the windows and doors of nearby homes.It was the most serious car-bomb attack against authorities in Mexico since June 2023, when a cartel used a car bomb to kill a National Guard officer in the nearby city of Celaya.In July 2023, a drug cartel in the neighboring state of Jalisco set off a coordinated series of seven roadway bombs that killed four police officers and two civilians. The improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, had apparently been planted in holes dug in the roadway.The use of car bombs, improvised explosive devices and bomb-dropping drones illustrate the increasingly open, military-style challenge posed by the country’s drug cartels.Sheinbaum has pledged to continue the policy of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of avoiding confrontations with drug cartels. Before he left office on Sept. 30, López Obrador publicly appealed to the gangs to keep violence down, and offered training programs aimed at reducing the number of young recruits for the cartels.The policy did not result in any significant reduction in Mexico’s historically high levels of homicides.Sheinbaum faces a big surge in violence simultaneously in the northern state of Sinaloa, the southern state of Chiapas, and in Guanajuato, the state that has had the highest number of homicides in Mexico.Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, has said she will make reducing violence in Guanajuato a priority, and said the attacks Thursday were being investigated.But David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Guanajuato, said the government has failed to recognize the scope of the problem. Sheinbaum and other officials almost always respond to the violence with stock phrases like “investigations are being carried out” or “the problem is being addressed.”“In the federal and state governments, there is a resistance to talking about narco terrorism, because they think it will create a bad image for the country,” Saucedo said. “The truth is that Mexico already has a bad image regarding crime and violence.”The problem is becoming more acute for the Mexican government, as drug cartels and violence in Mexico have become an issue in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.“There are voices within the government who think that talking about narco terrorism would add fuel to conservative sectors in the United States who want to send the U.S. army to fight the cartels,” he said.Saucedo said the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel — which has spent years fighting the Jalisco cartel for control of the state — is probably behind Thursday’s blasts.“Although these attacks in Acambaro and Jerecuaro are part of a local (cartel) strategy, they are also intended as a message from the criminal gangs to the president and the governor, that they will continue in the battle and will continue fighting for Guanajuato,” he noted.The attacks appeared to specifically target police offices or vehicles.","A car bomb left outside a police station in the town of Acambaro in western Mexico wounded three people.

Israel 's military announced on Thursday that it had killed Mohammad Abu Itiwi , a Hamas commander involved in the Oct 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel.As per the news agency Reuters, Itiwi was also employed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) in the Gaza Strip .UNRWA confirmed Itiwi's employment and his death, acknowledging that his name was included in a letter Israel had sent in July, which listed 100 staff members allegedly tied to armed groups , including Hamas.The Israeli military said Itiwi was killed on Wednesday and had participated in the murder and abduction of Israeli civilians.It also stated that Itiwi had been employed by UNRWA since July 2022, and his name was on a list of the agency's employees suspected of being linked to armed groups.UNRWA's director of communications, Juliette Touma , said the agency took the allegations seriously and requested further information from Israel, but it had not yet received a response.Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel had asked for urgent clarifications and an investigation into UNRWA employees' involvement in the Oct 7 massacre.""Israel has requested urgent clarifications from senior UN officials and an urgent investigation into the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Oct 7 massacre,"" said Hagari.UNRWA, which provides aid to Palestinians, has faced accusations from Israel of employing staff who are members of Hamas and other armed groups.In August, following an internal investigation, the UN said nine UNRWA employees were possibly involved in the attacks and subsequently dismissed them.Relations between Israel and UNRWA have worsened, with Israel calling for the agency to be disbanded.Mohammad Abu Itiwi was a Hamas commander involved in the brutal Oct 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel.

(Picture credit: AP)

What was the case?

The Menendez brothers , Lyle and Erik, could soon be eligible for parole after Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced plans to recommend their resentencing for the 1989 murder of their parents.The case has recently regained public attention, partly due to the Netflix crime drama ‘ Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story ’ and a documentary on Peacock.These productions have highlighted new evidence, including a letter written by Erik Menendez before the murders, alleging ongoing sexual abuse by his father.As per the news agency AP, the brothers were 21 and 18 at the time when they were sentenced to life without parole for the murders. Gascón cited new evidence supporting the brothers' long-standing claims of sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez , as a driving factor in his decision.“I believe they have paid their debt to society,” Gascón said during a press conference. He explained that while the violent killings were inexcusable, the circumstances surrounding the abuse needed consideration.The district attorney’s office will recommend a sentence of 50 years to life, which would make the brothers immediately eligible for parole since they were under 26 at the time of the crime.Despite the fresh evidence, not all members of the family support the release and some prosecutors within Gascón’s office oppose the resentencing recommendation.Kitty's sibling, Milton Andersen, thinks his nephews should stay in jail. In a recent statement, 90-year-old Andersen mentioned hiring a lawyer to contest the brothers' release.The Menendez brothers admitted to fatally shooting their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez , at their Beverly Hills home. Their defence claimed the murders were a result of years of abuse by their father, which had reached a breaking point when they feared their parents would kill them to prevent the abuse from becoming public.Prosecutors at the time argued the killings were financially motivated, seeking to inherit their parents' multimillion-dollar estate.Gascón’s decision comes amid growing support for the brothers’ release, including from family members such as their cousin Karen Vander Molen, who praised the district attorney’s “compassionate” decision.""This is about truth, justice and healing. It is time for Lyle and Erik to come home,"" she said. Some legal experts, however, anticipate a long legal process before any decision on the brothers' release is made.Furthermore, Roy Rossello, a former member of the 1980s pop group Menudo, alleged he too had been abused by Jose Menendez, adding credibility to the brothers' claims.A hearing on the matter is expected to take place soon.In 1989, Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion.The brothers claimed they acted out of fear for their lives after years of sexual abuse by their father. Prosecutors argued the crime was financially motivated, leading to their sentencing to life without parole.New evidence has since emerged, renewing public interest and supporting their claims of abuse, potentially affecting their sentences.","Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989.

Groping charge against Trump

With only two weeks remaining for the election 2024, former president Donald Trump faced a new allegation of harassment as a former model accused Trump of groping her at an event at Trump Tower in 1993. Stacy Williams said there was a ""twisted game"" being played and Trump was with Jeffrey Epstein. Ever since the allegation surfaced, Trump's old comments about his daughter Ivanka Trump went viral -- indicating that Trump made lewd comments about his daughter as well.Among many remarks that Trump made about his daughter Ivanka included 'voluptuous', 'a piece of a**' etc. He also said if Ivanka wasn't his daughter, Trump would have dated her.“You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model—a tremendous amount,"" Trump said in 2003 on the Howard Stern Show.“Let me tell you one thing: Ivanka is a great, great beauty. Every guy in the country wants to go out with my daughter. But she’s got a boyfriend,"" Trump said in 2004 in a New York Magazine interview.Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have been notably absent from Trump's campaign trail, though they were part of the Trump administration in the last term. Ivanka earlier said she would not be involved in politics and would be prioritizing her family, and three young children -- supporting her father from the outside. She was only present at the Republican National Convention. This time, instead of Ivanka and Jared, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are at the forefront of the campaign and will be part of the administration if Trump wins. In fact, JD Vance's name was suggested to Trump by his eldest son Donald Trump Jr, who is a friend of JD.The Trump campaign firmly denied the groping allegations, while accuser Stacy Williams claimed Trump pulled her close as a greeting, then proceeded to touch her chest, waist, and buttocks. She described feeling immobilized and deeply confused by his actions.Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Stace Williams was a former activist for Barack Obama and all the allegations are unequivocally false.","Former model Stacy Williams accused Donald Trump of groping her at an event at Trump Tower in 1993.

She has a lot of people she takes advice from but does not listen to any of them and does whatever she thinks is the best and that's always wrong.Vickers said when Meghan joined the Royal Family, the royal experts spoke highly of her as the first royal member who addressed the United Nations. But gradually, Meghan managed to upset all. ""For what it's worth, Meghan lost me as an ally, too, because when she first joined the Royal Family, the line I was taking was she's the first member to have addressed the United Nations. There was so much that she could do, but she gradually managed to upset everybody, including Tina Brown, and that can't be a coincidence,"" Vickers told The Sun.Vickers said Meghan's profile got a raise after marrying Prince Harry but Meghan was never particularly committed to becoming a member of the Royal Family. ""It does seem to me that she wasn't particularly committed to being a member of the Royal Family. By marrying Prince Harry, her profile went up globally, enormously, and so people wanted to hear more about her, and to some extent more from her..."" Vickers said.""...I think she probably misunderstood quite a lot of things to be quite honest about what it meant to be a member of the Royal Family, which is a life of complete service and devotion.""","Royal author Tina Brown said Meghan Markle has the worst judgement in the world.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Outbreak linked to slivered onions

A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers has led to two lawsuits , with the fast-food giant facing growing scrutiny over its food safety practices.Clarissa DeBock from Nebraska and a Colorado man, Eric Stelly , have both filed lawsuits against the company after contracting the E. coli O157:H7 strain, which has been linked to slivered onions used in the burgers.As per NBC News, DeBock fell ill five days after eating a Quarter Pounder at her local McDonald’s, experiencing severe abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, and nausea.Testing at the hospital confirmed her infection was related to the outbreak, which has sickened 49 people across 10 states and caused one death.“It’s scary because you trust fast-food places like McDonald’s to serve safe food,” DeBock said. She is seeking compensation for medical bills, lost wages, and physical and emotional suffering. Stelly’s lawsuit, filed in Chicago, also alleges negligence by McDonald’s, seeking damages of over $50,000, NBC reported.Eric Stelly, a Colorado resident, on Wednesday filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit against McDonald’s over the outbreak. Stelly ate at a McDonald’s in Greeley, Colorado, on October 4 and developed symptoms a few days later.He tested positive for E. coli, with health officials confirming his case was linked to the McDonald’s outbreak, reported the news agency Reuters.Stelly’s lawsuit, filed in Cook County, Illinois, where McDonald’s is headquartered, alleges that the fast-food chain was negligent in handling food safety protocols. He is seeking over $50,000 in damages for medical bills, lost wages, and the severe complications caused by the illness.The outbreak has particularly affected people across the West and Midwest, with one death and 10 hospitalisations due to serious complications from the E. coli strain.McDonald’s has since paused the distribution of slivered onions in affected areas after identifying the ingredient as the likely source of the contamination. Taylor Farms , the supplier of the onions, has initiated a recall of the affected products.The US Department of Agriculture is also testing samples of the beef patties to determine whether they played a role in the outbreak.Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, acknowledged the breach of trust and said the company is taking steps to rebuild public confidence. “Food safety is our top priority,” he stated, emphasising the importance of actions taken to protect the public and restore trust.","Clarissa DeBock from Nebraska and a Colorado man, Eric Stelly, have both filed lawsuits against the company after contracting the E. coli O157:H7 strain.

The event drew an impressive crowd of around 20,000 attendees, marking one of Harris's largest rallies to date.Speaking at the rally Obama claimed that Trump ""only cares about his ego, his money, his status."" The former president alleged that just because Trump acts ""goofy does not mean his presidency wouldn't be dangerous"".To support his argument, Obama cited the opinions of several high-ranking military officials who have worked closely with Trump. Obama quoted General John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff, who had earlier told the Atlantic that ""Trump told him he wanted his generals to be like Hitler's generals."" Obama humorously advised against comparing oneself to Hitler in politics, ""don't say you want to do anything like Hitler,"" he quipped.Harris echoed this sentiment, drawing on her experience as a prosecutor to frame Trump as akin to “predators, fraudsters, and repeat offenders.” She encouraged Georgians to remember that it was their turn to hold Trump accountable. “In 12 days, it’s Donald Trump’s turn. It’s his turn,” she declared, highlighting the urgency of the election and the need for voters to make a decisive choice.The rally, part of Harris's ""When We Vote We Win"" concert series, featured performances from Springsteen, who performed moving renditions of “The Promised Land” and “Land of Hope and Dreams.” He passionately declared that Harris is the candidate who truly respects the Constitution and has the vision to lead. “There is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear, Kamala Harris,” he said.This event is part of a concerted effort by Harris's campaign to leverage celebrity endorsements to boost voter turnout, especially as polls indicate a tight race in Georgia, a state Biden surprisingly won in 2020.",Kamala Harris held one of her largest rallies to date on Thursday.

'I felt frozen ... ': Former model claims Trump groped her during 1993 meeting with Jeffrey Epstein,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-felt-frozen-former-model-claims-trump-groped-her-during-1993-meeting-with-jeffrey-epstein/articleshow/114565736.cms,"-

Stacey Williams , a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, has publicly accused Donald Trump of groping her in the early 1990s, a claim she believes was an attempt to impress the late financier Jeffrey Epstein . In her interview with CNN, Williams provided detailed accounts of the alleged encounter, which occurred when she was in her twenties and briefly dating Epstein.Williams, now 56, recounted that in 1993, Epstein took her to Trump Tower in New York City, where they met Trump outside his office.“The second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn’t come off,” she described. She alleged that Trump’s hands moved over her body while he and Epstein conversed, leaving her in shock. “It was one of the strangest moments of my life,” she added, noting that she felt “frozen” and unable to respond.Following the encounter, Williams claimed she received a postcard from Trump featuring a picture of his Mar-a-Lago resort, with a handwritten note saying, “Stacey, Your home away from home. Love, Donald.” The Trump campaign has vehemently denied the allegations, dismissing them as “completely false” and suggesting they are politically motivated, particularly given their timing ahead of the upcoming election.In a statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt characterised the allegations as part of a smear campaign, linking them to support for Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. Williams, however, insists her decision to speak out was not influenced by the election, but rather by her involvement in a recent documentary about the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.Williams’s allegations contribute to a long history of women who have accused Trump of inappropriate behaviour. Over 20 women have come forward since he announced his candidacy in 2015, all of which Trump has categorically denied. Notably, his ties to Epstein, who was convicted of sex crimes and died in prison in 2019, have been the subject of scrutiny, with Trump once describing Epstein as a “terrific guy” before attempting to distance himself.During the CNN interview, Williams reflected on the emotional toll of the incident, stating, “I felt a wave of shame... it was coordinated, some kind of twisted game.” She revealed that Epstein had chastised her for allowing Trump to touch her, reinforcing the feeling of being manipulated.Williams had previously kept her experience private, only discussing it with close friends years later. Following the #MeToo movement, she began to seek avenues to share her story, eventually addressing the allegations in the documentary and on a recent Zoom call with “Survivors for Kamala.”As the election approaches, Williams hopes her story will encourage others to reconsider their support for Trump. “The thought of that monster being back in the White House is my absolute worst nightmare,” she concluded, emphasising the need for accountability regarding allegations of sexual misconduct .","Stacey Williams, a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, has publicly accused Donald Trump of groping her in the early 1990s.

Rock legend Bruce Springsteen has thrown his weight behind Kamala Harris , calling her the best hope for America while sharply criticising Donald Trump at a rally in Georgia on Thursday. Springsteen, known for his working-class anthems, took to the stage in Atlanta to perform and speak in support of Harris, who is running for the US presidency in the upcoming election.Springsteen didn't hold back in his remarks, stating, ""Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant.He does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be truly American."" He emphasised the need for leadership that reveres the Constitution and protects democracy. ""That’s why on November 5, I’m voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,"" he declared to the enthusiastic crowd. Springsteen performed three songs, including “The Promised Land” and “Land of Hope and Dreams,” amplifying his message of hope and resilience.Harris, who took to the stage after Springsteen, is increasingly relying on celebrity endorsements to energise her campaign as the election approaches. The event in Georgia, a key battleground state, also featured appearances from former President Barack Obama and filmmaker Tyler Perry. The rally aimed to inspire early voting and turn out voters, a crucial strategy in the final days of what is proving to be a tight race.""We have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of fear and divisiveness that Donald Trump has fostered,"" Harris told the crowd, urging them to vote early. Obama, campaigning for Harris in several swing states, echoed these sentiments, criticising Trump for self-interest and pointing to Harris’ background of hard work and public service.The Harris campaign has enlisted the support of various celebrities, including Taylor Swift, Oprah Winfrey, and Lizzo, to help energise voters. In contrast, Trump has received backing from figures like Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. Harris' team hopes that these endorsements will help sway undecided voters in key states.With the election drawing near and millions of early votes already cast in Georgia, the stakes couldn't be higher. Harris' appearance with stars like Springsteen is part of a larger effort to appeal to voters through both political and cultural influence.Reactions to Springsteen's performance were swift on social media. One user lamented, ""Oh no way! What has happened to Bruce Springsteen? He’s always sucked, but this is MAX cringe! Where’s the enthusiasm?"" Another added, ""OMG - ???????????? Pitiful cringe noise."" A third critic remarked, ""I've never heard someone do such a terrible rendition of their own song,"" while another noted, ""And the crowd goes mid for Bruce Springsteen at Kamala Harris’ rally.""","Kamala Harris is running for the US presidency in the upcoming election.

Ford presented the award to Trump backstage at his rally in DuluthEarlier this month, a Vietnam War veteran also joined Trump onstage during a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and presented him with his award.The veteran — identified only as Dwight by the campaign — said he “couldn’t think of anybody more deserving to have a Purple Heart” following the assassination attempt against the former president.In a separate video, shared by Trump adviser Dan Scavino on X, Trump shows off the medal, saying: “That’s the original! I can see that.”Trump also received a Purple Heart from a veteran during the 2016 campaign, raising questions and concerns among military medal experts.

'Within two seconds': Trump vows to fire the special counsel who indicted if re-elected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/within-two-seconds-trump-vows-to-fire-the-special-counsel-who-indicted-if-re-elected/articleshow/114560176.cms,"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said that if re-elected, he will fire the special counsel Jack Smith in ""two seconds"" who has brought two federal indictments against him in the past year and a half. Trump has been charged by Smith with plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss and illegally holding on to classified material after leaving office.In a recent interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Trump said, “I would fire him within two seconds.”The former President also called Smith “crooked,” a word he uses against most of his opponents.Trump's comments were his most direct yet regarding the potential fate of the federal cases against him if he were to win another term. He expressed confidence that he would not face impeachment for firing Smith, effectively challenging the House if Democrats were to regain control.Justice Department officials have indicated that Smith is prepared to pursue the cases against Trump for as long as legally possible, even during the period between Election Day and the inauguration if Trump prevails.Some of Trump's allies have argued that Smith was illegally appointed, and Judge Aileen M Cannon, a Trump appointee overseeing the classified documents case in Florida, initially dismissed the charges on those grounds.However, Smith's team appealed the ruling, and the lawyers handling Trump's election interference case in Washington were expected to raise a similar challenge, although its success remains uncertain given a federal appeals court's ruling validating special counsels like Smith.Both of Smith's cases face significant hurdles, even if Trump loses the election. The special counsel's office is currently defending the election subversion indictment against a recent Supreme Court ruling granting Trump broad immunity for official acts as president, which could take months to resolve.Additionally, even if Smith's appeal of Judge Cannon's ruling is successful, she could dismiss the charges again on separate legal grounds.During the interview, Trump also stated that he would not rule out pardoning Hunter Biden , the president's son, who was recently convicted and pleaded guilty in separate federal cases. Trump has repeatedly targeted the younger Biden in an attempt to tarnish the president and portray the justice system as biased against him, framing his own criminal cases as politically motivated.","Trump has been charged by special counsel Jack Smith with plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss and illegally holding on to classified material after leaving office.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan.The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer.

Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

Fake news of rape sparks real protest in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fake-news-of-rape-sparks-real-protest-in-pakistan/articleshow/114538687.cms,"The recent reports of a college campus rape that went viral on social media have sparked a heated debate in Pakistan . While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns.Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.
