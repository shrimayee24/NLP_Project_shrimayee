Wiped out terror HQ

Pakistan prepared for border hit, we struck at its heart

Will give befitting reply to terrorists on our terms

Every Indian must be able to live in peace

First of all, on behalf of the people of India, I salute the valiant forces of India, the Armed Forces, our intelligence agencies, and our scientists. Our brave soldiers displayed immense courage to achieve the objectives of Operation Sindoor . I pay tribute to their bravery, courage and valour. I dedicate this valour to every mother, every sister and every daughter of the country.The barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam on April 22 had shocked the entire country and the world. The merciless killing of innocent citizens in front of their family and their children on the basis of their religion was a very gruesome face of terror and cruelty. This was also a disgusting attempt to break the harmony and unity of the country. For me personally, this was very painful. After this terrorist attack, the entire nation, every citizen, every community, every class, every political party, unitedly stood up for strong action against terrorism. We gave full freedom to the Indian forces to wipe out the terrorists. And today every terrorist, every terror organisation knows the consequence of wiping out the Sindoor of our sisters and daughters.Operation Sindoor is our unwavering commitment to justice. Late night of May 6 and in the early morning of May 7, the whole world saw this pledge turn into reality. Indian forces attacked terror hideouts in Pakistan and their training centres with precision. The terrorists had never imagined that India could take such a big decision. But when the country is united, endowed with the spirit of Nation First and national interest is paramount, then strong decisions are taken, and results are achieved.When India’s missiles and drones attacked terrorist bases in Pakistan, not only the buildings of terrorist organisations but their courage also was shaken badly. Terrorist bases, like Bahawalpur and Muridke , are universities of global terrorism. The big terrorist attacks of the world, be it 9/11, be it London Tube bombings, or the big terrorist attacks which have happened in India in the last many decades, their roots are somehow connected to these terrorist hideouts. The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters. More than 100 dreaded terrorists have been killed in these attacks by India. Many terrorist leaders were roaming freely in Pakistan for the last two and a half to three decades, who used to conspire against India. India killed them in one stroke.Pakistan was deeply disappointed and frustrated by this action of India. It was bewildered, and in this bewilderment, it did another cowardly act. Instead of supporting India’s strike against terrorism, Pakistan started attacking India itself. Pakistan targeted our schools, colleges, gurdwaras, temples and houses of civilians. Pakistan targeted our military base.But in this act Pakistan itself got exposed. The world saw how Pakistan’s drones and missiles fell like straws in front of India. India’s strong air defence system destroyed them in the sky itself. Pakistan had prepared for an attack on the border, but India struck at the heart of Pakistan. India’s drones and missiles damaged those airbases of the Pakistani air forces, of which Pakistan was very proud. India caused heavy damage to Pakistan in the first three days itself, which it had never imagined.That’s why after India’s aggressive action, Pakistan started looking for ways to escape. Pakistan was pleading to the world to ease tensions. And after suffering heavy losses, Pakistan’s army contacted our DGMO on the afternoon of May 10. By then we had destroyed the infrastructure of terrorism on a large scale. The terrorists were eliminated. We had destroyed the terror camps established in the heart of Pakistan. Therefore, when Pakistan appealed and said that it will not indulge in any sort of terror activities or military audacity further, India considered it. And I am repeating again, we have just suspended our retaliatory action against Pakistan’s terror and military camps. In the coming days we will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead.After the surgical strike and air strike, now Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new parameter and new normal.First, if there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given.We will give a befitting response on our terms only. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge.Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.Thirdly, we will not differentiate between govt sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism. During Operation Sindoor, the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani army officers came to bid farewell to the slain terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat.We have defeated Pakistan every time on the battlefield. And this time Operation Sindoor has added a new dimension. We have proved our superiority in new age warfare. The credibility of our Made in India weapons was also proven. Today, the world is witnessing that in 21st century warfare, the time has come for Made in India defence equipment.This is certainly not the era of war, but this is also not the era of terrorism. Zero tolerance against terrorism is the guarantee for a better world.The way the Pakistani army, Pakistan govt are encouraging terrorism, it will destroy Pakistan one day. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure. There is no other way to peace. India’s stand is very clear... Terror and talks cannot go together... Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: If there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK).Today is Buddha Purnima . Lord Buddha has shown us the path of peace. The path of peace also goes through power. Humanity should move towards peace and prosperity. Every Indian should be able to live in peace and can fulfil the dream of Viksit Bharat. For this, it is very necessary for India to be powerful. And it is also necessary to use this power when required. And in the last few days, India has done just that.","PM Modi: 'Every Indian must be able to live in peace and harmony' 'Every terrorist, every terror organisation knows the consequence of wiping out the Sindoor of our sisters and daughters' 'Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new normal'","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121124553,imgsize-676237,width-400,resizemode-4/article-80.jpg"

The details of the deals have not been announced yet.

That being said, there was a lot of groundwork that went into these two days,"" Greer said.""Just remember why we're here in the first place -- the United States has a massive $1.2 trillion trade deficit, so the President declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs as we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency,"" Greer said.",The US on Sunday announced that it had struck a trade deal with China after two days of negotiation facilitated by the Swiss government.

"Operation Sindoor: Turkish drones to Chinese missiles, India beat them all",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/turkish-drones-to-chinese-missiles-india-beat-them-all-pakistan/articleshow/121121289.cms,"‘All our military bases, all our systems continue to remain fully operational. They are ready to undertake any future missions should the need arise,’ said Air Marshal Bharti

NEW DELHI: From Turkish drones to Chinese missiles , and possibly even a few Pakistani aircraft, all were thwarted by India's integrated multi-layered air defence network during three days of intense hostilities, top military officers said on Monday.""Our integrated air defence (AD) systems stood like a wall and they (Pakistan) could not breach it. Whether it's a Turkish drone or anything else, it fails in front of the technology of India,"" director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti said.""The sky remains ours,"" with a relatively impregnable AD shield, was the underlying message of the briefing he addressed with his Army and Navy counterparts, Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and Vice Admiral A N Pramod, on Monday.""All our military bases, all our systems continue to remain fully operational. They are ready to undertake any future missions should the need arise,"" Air Marshal Bharti added.The officers showed evidentiary photos of Pakistan having used Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles as well as Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze and Asisguard Songar drones, apart from long-range rockets, loiter munitions and quadcopters.Most of them were shot down by India's AD systems, while the ones that got through caused only minimal damage. ""Whenever Pakistan Air Force attacked us, it failed in front of our AD grid,"" Lt-Gen Ghai said.As reported by TOI earlier, the AD network of surveillance and target-acquisition radars and a wide array of weapon systems are all plugged into the integrated air command and control system (IACCS) of the IAF and the Akashteer system to provide a composite real-time air picture to the armed forces.The network stretches from the long-range Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range) and Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, to the shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).The indigenous Akash system, which is capable of intercepting hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a range of 25-km, falls in between. ""Another highlight has been the stellar performance of indigenous AD weapons like Akash,"" Air Marshal Bharti said.The IAF, as reported by TOI earlier, has inducted the bulk of the 15 squadrons of Akash-1 and 2 systems it has ordered for Rs 10,900 crore. The Army, in turn, has four Akash regiments worth Rs 22,340 crore, with more in the pipeline. A new-generation Akash weapon system, with an interception range of 30-km, is also now ready for the final trials.The senior IAF officer also praised the ""performance and efficacy"" demonstrated by even older AD systems like the Pechora missiles, OSA-AK-m (10-km) and low-level L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) in countering the ""Pakistani threat vectors"".Of the 300 to 400 drones launched by Pakistan across the entire western front on May 8, for instance, 50 were destroyed by L-70 and ZU-23mm twin-barrel guns and other such weapons.Another 20 drones were jammed and spoofed by a variety of devices, while the rest flew back across the border. At the other end of the spectrum, a Pakistani high-speed missile was intercepted over Sirsa by an advanced AD missile system on May 10.Though the Navy's formidable ""fleet air defence mechanism"" did not come into play in the northern Arabian Sea, Vice Admiral Pramod said the presence of aircraft carrier INS Vikrant battlegroup, with MiG-29K fighters and early-warning helicopters, compelled the Pakistan Air Force to remain ""bottled-up"" close to the Makran coast.","The officers showed evidentiary photos of Pakistan having used Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles as well as Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze and Asisguard Songar drones.

PM Modi negates Trump claim that US brokered ‘ceasefire’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-negates-trump-claim-that-us-brokered-ceasefire/articleshow/121121594.cms,"NEW DELHI: Without referring to US President Donald Trump PM Modi negated his claim that his administration was instrumental in getting India and Pakistan to suspend hostilities and agree to start comprehensive negotiations for peace.In his address to the nation on Monday evening, PM Modi emphasised that Pakistan — shaken by the damage inflicted upon its airbases and terror infrastructure it has created — made a direct plea to India’s DGMO for a ceasefire.The refutation came within minutes of Trump’s reiteration of the claim he first made on Saturday about his administration being the mediator between New Delhi and Islamabad. On Saturday, my administration helped broker a full and immediate ceasefire - I think a permanent one - between India and Pakistan, ending a dangerous conflict between two nations with lots of nuclear weapons,"" he said Monday.Minutes later, PM Modi asserted that India had only agreed to pause ' Operation Sindoor ' and that Pakistan will continue to be under watch, suggesting that all bets will be off if Islamabad did not stop its support to terrorism He also made it clear that Pakistan's nuclear blackmail - something which India believes that the US and the West in general have consistently indulged - is not going to deter India from acting against terrorists operating under the cover of the assumption that Pakistan's generals may unleash their nukes to save groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e Muhammad.Modi made it clear that India will discuss only terrorism and POK with Pakistan - a condition that Islamabad is unlikely to accept, at least in the near future.Trump had claimed that he had used trade as the lever for getting India and Pakistan on the negotiating table. ""Come on, we are going to do a lot of trade with you guys, so let's stop it. People have never really used trade the way I use it. Then all of a sudden they said - let's stop,"" he had first said in the context that the US was going to trade more with both countries.The assertion was not only refuted by official sources that US V-P J D Vance had brought up the trade issue when he called the PM on Friday, it also appeared to be running afoul of Modi's assertion to let his ""tough on terror"" stand be encumbered by any consideration, trade including.In his address, Modi reiterated that trade and terror cannot go together.

India-Pakistan tensions: Did China send cargo plane with military supplies to Pakistan? What its military said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-china-send-cargo-plane-with-military-supplies-to-pakistan-what-its-military-said/articleshow/121109836.cms,"AI-generated image

Poll Do you believe the Chinese military's denial of sending arms to Pakistan? No, I think there's more to the story. Yes, I believe their statement.

Chinese military on Monday addressed the reports claiming that it sent its largest military cargo plane with arms supplies to Pakistan during its offensive against India last week. The People's Liberation Army Air Force called it a ""rumour"" and warned of legal action against those behind this.In a statement published on the official website of the Chinese defence ministry, the Air Force clarified that no such mission had taken place, countering the speculation circulating across various internet platforms about China's ""Y-20 transporting relief supplies to Pakistan"".""The internet is not beyond the law! Those who produce and spread military-related rumours will be held legally responsible!"" the report added.This came after Beijing rejected claims by Pakistan that it used Chinese fighter jets against India during Operation Sindoor . It had also stressed upon its anti-terrorism stance saying, ""China opposes all forms of terrorism. We urge both sides to act in the larger interest of peace and stability, remain calm, exercise restraint, and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation.""The reports of China helping Pakistan received fuel after it expressed support for its ""all-weather friend"" during Operation Sindoor.Meanwhile, China has become the primary arms supplier to Pakistan, accounting for a staggering 81% of Islamabad’s total weapons imports between 2020 and 2024, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).Operation Sindoor, launched in response to Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepalese citizen, has seen the Indian Armed Forces carry out a series of precision strikes deep inside Pakistan.According to official statements, nine terror camps across Pakistan were targeted during the midnight operation, as part of a broader retaliation aimed at dismantling infrastructure supporting cross-border terrorism.","Chinese military denied sending arms to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.

""It is a serious breach of privacy that could put her safety at risk,"" she said. Such personal attacks on family members of the country's senior-most public servants like Misri are not only unacceptable but also morally indefensible, NCW said.The Misri family also received support from veteran diplomat Nirupama Menon Rao . ""Doxxing his daughter and abusing his loved ones crosses every line of decency. This toxic hate must stop - stand united behind our diplomats, not tear them down,"" she said.","NCW chief Vijaya Rahatkar said sharing personal contact details of the secretary's daughter is a ""grossly irresponsible act"" Such personal attacks on family members of the country's senior-most public servants like Misri are not only unacceptable but also morally indefensible.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121121635,imgsize-1131777,width-400,resizemode-4/article-59.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a strong message to Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi urged it to demolish ""terror universities"" for its own survival. ""The way the Pakistani army and Pakistan government are encouraging terrorism, it will destroy Pakistan one day. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure,"" he said.Detailing the success of India's military offensive under Operation Sindoor , PM Modi said that Pakistan proved to be no match to the bravery, courage and capabilities of Indian forces. He also faulted Pakistan for attacking India instead of taking action against terrorists. ""Pakistan targeted our schools, colleges, gurudwaras, temples and houses of civilians. Pakistan targeted our military base but in this act, Pakistan itself got exposed. The world saw how Pakistan's drones and missiles fell like straws in front of India. India's strong air defence system destroyed them in the sky itself. Pakistan had prepared for an attack on the border, but India struck at the heart of Pakistan. India's drones and missiles attacked with precision. They damaged those air bases of the Pakistani air force, of which Pakistan was very proud.""He said that while India has defeated Pakistan in all battles, the success of Operation Sindoor was significant because it established the country's ""superiority in New Age warfare and the capability of Made-in-India weapons.In his address to the nation, Modi also made it clear that India would not brook any attempt at international mediation and any effort to put J&K back on the negotiation table. ""Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stand has been - if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir ,"" in what sounded like a message aimed at US president Donald Trump, who on Monday spoke of his interest in brokering a ""permanent"" ceasefire between India and Pakistan.The 22-minute-long address, which was broadcast in 10 languages, drastically lowered the threshold for a military retaliation against acts of terrorism by groups based in and supported by Pakistan, while setting tougher standards for judging Pakistan's compliance with India's insistence that it take action against terrorists. Laying out the new benchmarks, PM Modi said: ""First, if there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given. Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail. Thirdly, we will not differentiate between the government-sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism. During Operation Sindoor the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani officers came to bid farewell to terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat.""PM Modi said that Operation Sindoor became a necessity because of the barbarity of the terrorists who killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam. ""The merciless killing of innocent citizens in front of their families and their children on the basis of their religion was a very gruesome face of terror and cruelty. This was also a disgusting attempt to harm our unity and integrity,"" Modi said. He added that the slaughter, which shocked the entire country and the world, was ""very painful for him"".","PM Narendra Modi urges Pakistan to demolish ""terror universities"" for its own survival. He says Pakistan proved to be no match to the bravery, courage and capabilities of Indian forces. Modi also made it clear that India would not brook any attempt at international mediation and any effort to put J&K back on negotiation table.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121121375,imgsize-694551,width-400,resizemode-4/article-50.jpg"

We share the grief of the family and stand in solidarity,” LG Sinha said at the ceremony organised at Shahid Smarak, BSF Frontier HQ in Paloura Camp, Jammu.“We are proud of his sacrifice. He joined the BSF in April 2021 and was the family’s sole breadwinner. Due to health issues, I am unable to work,” the martyr’s father, Chingakham Bonibihari Singh, told PTI. “He would call me now and then to ask what I needed. He always told me to work hard to succeed in life. Now he is gone.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Schools and colleges in J&K will reopen Tuesday but those in border areas will remain closed for now as a precautionary measure, authorities said Monday amid early signs of a return to normality following the pause in hostilities with Pakistan.Separately, official sources said civilian flights from Srinagar airport will resume from Tuesday after remaining cancelled for almost a week since the launch of Operation Sindoor against Pakistan on May 7. Haj flights from Srinagar will resume on Wednesday.While the return to normal life came as a relief for most, chief minister Omar Abdullah offered a reality check. “May we never face such a situation again. But if we do, we must be better prepared,” Omar said after reviewing damage from Pakistani attacks in Jammu.On schools in heavily shelled and vulnerable border zones, J&K education minister Sakina Itoo revealed that the govt would arrive at a decision on Tuesday. Jammu divisional commissioner Jammu confirmed the partial resumption, saying this was decided by the Union Territory’s education department “after reviewing the situation” following the halt in the conflict.A massive clearance operation continued in border areas. On Monday, police allowed residents of Kamalkote, Gowhallan, Madha, Salamabad, Gangerhill, and Gawalta villages in Uri sector of north Kashmir’s Baramulla to return to their homes after clearing these hamlets of unexploded ordnances.On Monday, the Army disclosed that border areas experienced their first night of calm, with no cross-border shelling reported anywhere. “The night remained largely peaceful across J&K and other areas along the border,” an Army statement said.In Jammu, CM Omar signalled the challenges ahead. “For the first time, even old quarters of Jammu have been affected. We are now forced to contemplate building bunkers in the city —something previously unimaginable,” Omar said, highlighting the expanding threat of cross-border shelling.Omar stressed the need for immediate reforms in preparedness for such conflicts. His statements followed an extensive tour to assess the ground situation in the aftermath of the recent cross-border shelling in Poonch, among the worst-affected districts in cross-border shelling that resulted in the loss of 13 lives and injuries to many others.“We must learn from this experience and rectify our shortcomings. Strengthening hospital infrastructure is essential. We plan to establish critical infrastructure including fixed and mobile bunkers, reinforce ambulance services, and improve evacuation mechanisms in border areas through mock drills and practical assessments,” Omar said.",Schools and colleges in J&K will reopen Tuesday but those in border areas will remain closed for now as a precautionary measure. Civilian flights from Srinagar airport will resume from Tuesday after remaining cancelled for almost a week since the launch of Operation Sindoor against Pakistan on May 7.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121120802,imgsize-665961,width-400,resizemode-4/article-45.jpg"
"Cash disappearance: Justice Varma’s personal secretary, staff suspected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-disappearance-justice-varmas-personal-secretary-staff-suspected/articleshow/121092411.cms,"Justice Varma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, in its report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.The inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman recorded the statements of the judge’s private secretary and staff, security personnel posted at his residence as well as fire and police personnel on the fire incident at the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow, the official residence of then Delhi HC judge Varma.All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire that broke out at the storeroom within the judge’s residential premises and left the place without seizing any of the cash, either burnt or unburnt.Delhi HC Chief Justice D K Upadhyay, on being informed about the incident by the Delhi Police commissioner at 4.50pm on March 15, had instructed his registrar-cum-secretary to visit Justice Varma’s residence and inspect the place of fire. On reaching the residence, he was taken to Justice Varma by the latter’s private secretary.Justice Varma took the CJ’s secretary to the room, which was adjacent to the judge’s official residence. He found that though burnt articles and debris were in the room, there was no sign of any cash, burnt or unburnt.The inquiry panel recorded that the fire service was alerted by police, who got the first call about the incident at the judge’s residence at 11.35pm on March 14.They reached the spot at 11.43pm, doused the fire and left the scene at 1.56am on March 15. The panel also found that shortly thereafter police personnel, who videographed the incident, also left the house, leaving behind the cash as it were in the room. Security personnel posted at the judge’s residence informed the panel that Justice Varma’s private secretary and personal staff stayed back. The panel said it is prima facie of the opinion that the cash disappeared from the room in the early hours of March 15 and that the fire scene was cleared of all burnt and unburnt notes, which could not have been done without the knowledge and involvement of the judge’s private secretary and personal staff.However, the panel said it would require a formal investigation to summon witnesses and record their statements, which cannot be done by the informal inquiry panel as it had not been conferred with powers to probe as per the criminal procedure code. It is to be seen whether Delhi HC initiates any disciplinary proceedings against the judge’s private secretary based on the inquiry panel’s prima facie findings.CJI Khanna had forwarded the inquiry report to Justice Varma seeking his response and with a suggestion that he should quit judgeship. Justice Varma refused to quit, forcing the CJI to send the inquiry report along with the judge’s response to the President and the PM for formal initiation of a removal motion against him.Justice Varma was repatriated from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC, his parent high court, immediately after the constitution of the inquiry panel and has been stripped of judicial work.","A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.

This came even as the opposition party has offered its support to the government in its efforts against terrorism after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people on April 22.""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India,"" Tharoor said in a post on X. BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action. India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for invoking a political flavour to the India-Pakistan tensions.

ISLAMABAD: A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh while the Rahim Yar Khan airbase housed within the international airport of the same name in Punjab province suffered massive damage in coordinated Indian missile strikes targeting the country’s air defence infrastructure, authorities confirmed Sunday after taking stock of the impact of India’s “retaliatory” action early on May 10.The missile fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on the portion of the runway, the district deputy commissioner said.Sources acknowledged that the attack in the dead of night had been timed to avoid civilian casualties. Although passenger flights to and from the airport have since resumed, the missile strike has severely limited the military operations from the airbase.Pakistani officials emphasise Rahim Yar Khan’s strategic role in southern air defences, close to India’s Rajasthan border. They contested India’s statement that a wave of drones launched from the airbase to attack border villages invited the strong missile retaliation.The PAF casualties at Base Bholari in Sindh’s Jamshoro district included Sq Ldr Usman Yousaf and four others in uniform. The base supports F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets, critical to Pakistan’s southern air operations. Pakistani authorities didn’t specify the material losses. Indian media reports, unverified by Pakistan, suggest damage to aircraft and infrastructure.Pakistani officials also confirmed simultaneous attacks on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab), Murid airbase in Chakwal and Chunian airbase in Punjab. They mentioned damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.India officially named eight PAF bases, including radar sites in Pasrur and Sialkot. Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan-ul-Marsoos” targeting Indian sites didn’t cause significant damage, the Indian military said in its first official presser since a pause in military operations.","A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh.

Hamas' strategic move ahead of Trump's visit

Support floods in for Edan!





Hamas released Edan Alexander , a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier on Monday, as a goodwill gesture towards the Trump administration.He is the first hostage freed since Israel ended an eight-week ceasefire with Hamas back in March and had been held captive in Gaza for over 19 months. Born in Tel Aviv and raised in New Jersey, Edan Alexander holds dual Israeli-American citizenship and is believed to be the last living American hostage held in Gaza.He was handed over to the Red Cross and then to Israeli forces before being airlifted to a hospital in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials shared videos and images that showed a pale yet smiling Alexander reuniting emotionally with his mother and other family members.Hamas announced its plan to release Alexander just ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle-East on Tuesday, marking his first official trip abroad during his second term.On Sunday, Trump referred to the impending release as ""a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators - Qatar and Egypt aimed at ending this brutal war and bringing ALL living hostages and remains back to their families.""""Hopefully, this marks the beginning of the final steps needed to conclude this harsh conflict. I eagerly anticipate that day of celebration!"" Trump expressed on social media.Wearing shirts with his name, Alexander's extended family gathered in Tel Aviv to witness his release, chanting his name as the military announced his freedom. Meanwhile, in Hostage Square, hundreds of people erupted in cheers.In Tenafly, New Jersey, his hometown, hundreds of supporters filled the streets, holding signs with his image and listening to music from Israel. As they watched his release on a large screen, the crowd embraced and waved Israeli flags. Since his abduction, supporters have rallied every Friday to advocate for the release of hostages.According to Israeli authorities, 58 hostages are still being held, with about 23 believed to be alive.

China's President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, in a veiled attack on the United States, slammed bullying and tyranny and said there are no winners in tariff and trade wars. This statement came a day after the US and China announced an agreement to reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days.While addressing the opening ceremony of the China-CELAC Forum, Xi Jinping said, ""Bullying and tyranny will only isolate oneself.""

'UK not a bystander':





Rights groups and NGOs are dragging the UK government to court on Tuesday accusing it of breaching international law by supplying fighter jet parts to Israel amid the war in Gaza.Supported by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch , Oxfam and others, the Palestinian rights association Al-Haq is seeking to stop the government's export of UK-made components for Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets Israel has used the American warplanes to devastating effect in Gaza and the West Bank, and the head of Amnesty UK said Britain had failed to uphold its ""legal obligation... to prevent genocide"" by allowing the export of key parts to Israel.The plane's refuelling probe, laser targeting system, tyres, rear fuselage, fan propulsion system and ejector seat are all made in Britain, according to Oxfam, and lawyers supporting Al-Haq's case said the aircraft ""could not keep flying without continuous supply of UK-made components"".It is not clear when a decision could be made following the four-day hearing at London's High Court, the latest stage in a long-running legal battle.Lawyers for the Global Action Legal Network (GLAN) have said they launched the case soon after Israel's assault on Gaza was triggered by the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks.Israel has repeatedly denied accusations of genocide.The lawyers said the UK government had decided in December 2023 and April and May 2024 to continue arms sales to Israel, before in September 2024 then suspending licenses for weapons which were assessed as being for military use by the Israeli army in Gaza.The new Labour government suspended around 30 licences following a review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, but the partial ban did not cover British-made parts for the advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets.A UK government spokesperson told AFP it was ""not currently possible to suspend licensing of F-35 components for use by Israel without prejudicing the entire global F-35 programme, due to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security"".""Within a couple of months of coming to office, we suspended relevant licences for the IDF that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of International Humanitarian Law in Gaza,"" they said.The government insisted it had ""acted in a manner consistent with our legal obligations"" and was ""committed to upholding our responsibilities under domestic and international law"".But GLAN described the F-35 exemption as a ""loophole"" which allowed the components to reach Israel indirectly through a global pooling system.Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer for GLAN, told a briefing last week the UK government had ""expressly departed from its own domestic law in order to keep arming Israel"", with F-35s being used to drop ""multi-ton bombs on the people of Gaza"".Hamas's 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that at least 2,749 people have been killed since Israel ended a two-month ceasefire in mid-March, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,862.""Under the Genocide Convention, the UK has a clear legal obligation to do everything within its power to prevent genocide,"" said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive.""Yet the UK government continues to authorise the export of military equipment to Israel -- despite all the evidence that genocide is being committed by Israel against the Palestinian people in Gaza.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt took the unprecedented step of issuing a gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League - the country's oldest political party - and its affiliated outfits, in a move critics say reflects a deepening political crisis following the ouster of longtime PM Sheikh Hasina. The ban, enforced under a hastily amended Anti-Terrorism Act, marks a dramatic escalation in the Muhuammad Yunus-led govt's efforts to reshape the post-Hasina political landscape.The home ministry invoked Section 18 of the new Act to impose the ban, citing ""reasonable grounds"" that the party and its affiliates were involved in terrorism.The revised law permits govt to declare any 'entity' - not just individuals - as terrorist if sufficient grounds exist. According to the gazette, the ban will remain in effect until International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh completes the trials of Awami League members and activists accused of crimes against humanity during last year's anti-govt protests, which led to the ousting of Hasina on Aug 5, ending her 16-year rule.On Saturday, the interim govt announced the prohibition of all Awami League activities, including online engagement, press statements, and public gatherings.The following night, President Mohammed Shahabuddin promulgated an ordinance reinforcing the law by banning all forms of publicity or expression of support for individuals or entities charged under Section 18(1). Awami League has rejected govt's decision and vowed to continue its political activities ""in an appropriate manner"".The ban will be there until ICT completes the trial of the party and its leaders.Meanwhile, Gono Odhikar Parishad, a political party, has urged Election Commission to cancel the registration of Awami League and other members of the 14-party alliance, including Jatiya Party. However, the CEC, AMM Nasir Uddin, said, ""Let the official notification come first. We are waiting for the gazette.""",Bangladesh's interim govt issues gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League and its affiliated outfits.

Here's how much the Trump administration is spending to deport immigrants to Guantanamo Bay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heres-how-much-the-trump-administration-is-spending-to-deport-immigrants-to-guantanamo-bay/articleshow/121123774.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





The Trump administration spent more than $21 million transporting migrants to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as part of a controversial immigration crackdown, according to Pentagon data provided to Congress.The information was released in response to questions from Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.Between January 20 and April 8, the US transportation command operated 46 military flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay, totalling 802.5 flight hours at an average cost of $26,277 per hour.According to CBS News, this brought the overall cost to approximately $21 million. The defense department also disclosed that 31 additional flights carried military personnel, equipment, and supplies, incurring another $1.67 million in expenses, most of which went to United Airlines and charter company Omni Air International. These commercial flights did not transport migrants.US President Donald Trump announced in January that Guantanamo Bay would serve as a detention site for up to 30,000 migrants, prioritising those he called the “worst offenders.”However, the facility has held fewer than 500 migrants in total and never more than 200 at any given time, reported NBC News.A defense official cited by NBC revealed that just 32 migrants remain detained there.Many migrants flown to Guantanamo were eventually sent back to the US or transferred elsewhere, undermining the administration's promise of a long-term holding strategy.As per CBS News, both high-threat and low-risk individuals had been detained at the base under broad criteria set by the administration, sparking legal and ethical concerns.The project, dubbed "" Operation Southern Guard "" and led by the department of homeland security with support from immigration and customs enforcement and the US military, was met with logistical issues, internal disagreements, and criticism from lawmakers.“Every American should be outraged by Donald Trump wasting military resources to pay for his political stunts that do not make us safer,” Warren said in a statement. “US service members did not sign up for this abuse of power.”Following the backlash and high costs, DHS suspended military deportation flights on March 1 and began using commercial airlines, which were deemed more cost-effective, reported The Independent.The agency has also launched a voluntary self-deportation programme via the CBP Home app, offering $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who choose to leave the US voluntarily, a measure aimed at reducing deportation costs by up to 70 percent.Despite these changes, NBC News reported that preparations are underway to increase Guantanamo’s capacity, with an additional weekly flight ordered by the US transportation command.","The US transportation command operated 46 military flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay, totalling 802.5 flight hours at an average cost of $26,277 per hour.

""I know that for a fact. How far he'll go with it is only one's guess, but he won't just sit back. I don't think he'll be the silent one,"" he said.Several right-wing influencers called the pope anti-Trump. Laura Loomer, an American far-right political activist and Trump adviser, ranted about the “woke Marxist pope” and claimed he “is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis,” adding that it’s “gross” that he is now in charge of the Vatican.","Bannon predicted that there's definitely going to be friction between the new pope and Trump.

Trump said on Monday the US was extending citizenship to these individuals, who he said were victims of a genocide. He said, ""Farmers are being killed... They happen to be white.

A group of 49 white South Africans landed in the United States this week after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration, a move that has sparked international controversy and raised sharp questions about race, asylum policy, and political motivations.Arriving at Dulles International Airport aboard a US-chartered private plane, the group mostly Afrikaners was welcomed by senior Trump officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Troy Edgar. Children in the group waved small American flags as officials spoke of their struggles and offered reassurances of safety and support.“You are really welcome here,” Landau told the group in a hangar at the airport. “We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have had to deal with.”President Donald Trump defended the decision, citing what he called ""a genocide"" against white farmers in South Africa . He has long promoted claims that Afrikaners face race-based violence and property confiscation under the post-apartheid government. Speaking to reporters earlier, Trump said he planned to raise the matter directly with South African leadership.However, the South African government has rejected these claims as ""completely false."" President Cyril Ramaphosa said he had spoken to Trump and explained that the information he was acting on was misinformation, largely spread by groups opposed to land reform and racial transformation efforts.“There is no data at all that backs that there is persecution of white South Africans or white Afrikaners in particular,” Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said. While white farmers have been victims of rural crime, he noted, they are affected in much the same way as other citizens.The resettlement follows an executive order signed by Trump in February, which fast-tracks refugee applications for white South African farmers on grounds of "" race-based persecution "" a sharp departure from the usual refugee process that can take years. Critics have pointed to the contradiction between this decision and Trump’s broader immigration policy, which largely halted refugee admissions from other parts of the world.Reports suggest that as many as 1,000 Afrikaners could be resettled in the US this year. The Episcopal Church’s migration service has refused to take part, citing its commitment to racial justice. Still, Trump allies like Elon Musk have echoed the president's concerns, with Musk claiming on social media that South African politicians are encouraging “white genocide” a claim widely discredited by experts.Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch, German, and French settlers, make up about 7% of South Africa’s population but retain a disproportionate share of the country’s wealth and farmland.","49 white South Africans landed in the United States this week after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration.

Advocacy group Defending Rights & Dissent said it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the notion of border officials stopping political commentators to interrogate them about constitutionally-protected speech.""Such an abuse of power is an affront to press freedom ,"" it said.","US citizen Hasan Piker says he was held at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for over two hours on Sunday. Piker has millions of followers on YouTube, Twitch and X, and been outspoken in his criticism of Israel.

Deputy attorney general who defended Trump in hush money trial is named acting librarian of Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deputy-attorney-general-who-defended-trump-in-hush-money-trial-is-named-acting-librarian-of-congress/articleshow/121124205.cms,"Deputy attorney general who defended Trump in hush money trial is named acting librarian of Congress





WASHINGTON: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche , who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, has been appointed acting librarian of Congress , the Justice Department said Monday. Blanche replaces longtime librarian Carla Hayden, whom the White House fired last week amid criticism from conservatives that she was advancing a ""woke"" agenda. Also Monday, two other Trump appointees to the library attempted unsuccessfully to enter the Copyright Office, according to a person with knowledge of the incident. Brian Nieves, a deputy chief of staff and senior counsel in Blanche's office, was named acting assistant librarian, Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin confirmed. And Paul Perkins, an associate deputy attorney general and veteran Justice Department attorney, is now the acting register of copyrights and director of the Copyright Office, replacing Shira Perlmutter , whom the Trump administration pushed out last weekend.Nieves and Perkins were in the hallway outside the Copyright Office, which is part of the Library of Congress, but could not get in without access to badges, according to the person. After a brief discussion with library officials and U.S. Capitol Police, whom the library had contacted, the appointees left voluntarily. The person was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Capitol Police said that no one was barred from, or escorted out of, the building and otherwise referred questions back to the Library of Congress.Senate Majority Leader John Thune , R-S.D., told reporters Monday that lawmakers are investigating whether Trump has the power to fire the librarian of Congress, who is technically a legislative branch employee.""We want to make sure congressional equities are respected and protected in this process,"" Thune said.The Associated Press obtained an internal memo from Robert Randolph Newlen , who had been serving as acting librarian, saying that Congress was ""engaged"" with the White House about Blanche's appointment and that the library had not yet ""received direction from Congress about how to move forward.""The implications of Trump's installing a close ally as librarian of Congress could be far-reaching.For instance, the librarian could see requests made by lawmakers to the Congressional Research Service, which are usually seen only by the requesting office and the CRS itself, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The nonpartisan agency is largely known as the think tank of Capitol Hill and provides analyses meant to help lawmakers in the legislative process. But Democrats are already concerned about what kind of information Trump-appointed officials could access in a process that is typically confidential between CRS and lawmakers.Senior House Democrats on Monday also raised the prospect that data held by the Library of Congress, which holds a vast archive of books and historical documents, could have been improperly transferred to the executive branch, including officials at Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.Unauthorized information sharing ""could compromise legislative branch independence and the ability of Members of Congress to carry out their constitutional duties,"" according to the letter, which was signed by lawmakers including New York Rep. Joe Morelle and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro , the top Democrats on the House Administration and Appropriations committees, respectively. They are asking for an inspector general investigation.Since returning to office in January, Trump has purged officials he regards as opposed to him and to his Republican agenda. Hayden, nominated by President Barack Obama in 2015 and confirmed on a 74-18 Senate vote the following year, named Perlmutter as head of the Copyright Office in 2020.Shortly before her firing, Perlmutter's office released a highly anticipated report that questioned the legality of the tech industry's use of copyrighted works to ""train"" their artificial intelligence systems and compete with the human-made works they were trained on.Tech companies have argued their AI training practices are protected by the ""fair use"" doctrine, which allows for limited uses of copyrighted materials such as for teaching, research or transforming the copyrighted work into something different.Perlmutter's report questioned those assumptions, arguing that ""making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries.""The report - despite being marked as ""pre-publication"" - quickly made waves in legal circles after it was posted online late last week, winning praise from creators who have challenged the tech industry in court, and criticism from a tech industry trade group.It was the third and final part of a yearslong study that Perlmutter began in 2023, with the intent to advise Congress and others on whether reforms are needed. The report didn't call for government intervention, and its nuanced findings hold no official weight in the numerous copyright infringement lawsuits now pending against tech companies.But attention around the report grew after Perlmutter's firing Saturday, including from Trump's supporters.Mike Davis, a lawyer who regularly defends Trump, posted an alarm emoji on social media and warned: ""Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators' copyrights for AI profits. This is 100% unacceptable.""Blanche was named the No. 2 Justice Department official after serving as Trump's criminal defense attorney in two cases brought by the department during President Joe Biden's administration. He is a former federal prosecutor who was a key figure on Trump's defense team in his New York hush money trial, which ended in a conviction on 34 felony counts.

Who is Donald Trump's 'brilliant but seriously overweight' friend from his viral story? Why everyone thinks it's Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-donald-trumps-brilliant-but-seriously-overweight-friend-from-his-viral-story-why-everyone-thinks-its-elon-musk/articleshow/121121423.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

Why does everyone think it's Elon Musk?



Many people said it's Robert Kiyosaki







President Donald Trump dished out the most bizarre story as he spoke about reducing medicine prices in the US. The story is the context of why the president thought medicine prices should be controlled but it set the social media on fire as people thought the story was hilarious.Trump said US has been subsidizing other countries but paying the most for medicines. ""I’ll tell you a story. A friend of mine who’s a businessman, very, very very top guy. Most of you would have heard of him, a highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously overweight, and he takes the fat, the fat shot drug,"" Trump said, introducing the story.""And he called me up, and he said, 'President', he used to call me Donald, now he calls me president, so that’s nice respect. But he’s a rough guy, smart guy. Very successful, very rich. I wouldn’t even know how we would know this, because he’s got comments.""“President, could I ask you a question?” “What?” “I’m in London, and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take.” I said, “it’s not working.” He said, he said, “I just paid $88, and in New York I pay $1,300. What the hell is going on?” He said, “So I checked. And it’s the same box, made in the same plant, by the same company.It’s the identical pill that I buy in New York. And here I’m paying $88 in London. In New York, I’m paying $1,300. ”""Now, this is a great businessman so, but he’s not familiar with this crazy situation that we have. But he was stunned. But it was just one of those stories. And I brought it up with the drug companies, represented by somebody who’s very, very smart, good person too. And we argued about it for about half hour. And then finally he just said, because they can’t justify it, he just said, “Look, you got me.”Trump dropped enough hints that it was not Elon Musk as Musk does not call Donald Trump by name. But X users had a field day making fun of Elon Musk as he acknowledged taking Ozempic, the fat shot drug that probably Trump referred to.Also, Elon Musk is not overweight and during the election campaign, Donald Trump praised his abs.Many social media users delved deep and decoded that Trump was actually speaking about Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki who's a friend.","Trump said US has been subsidizing other countries but paying the most for medicines.

Pakistan’s ‘innocent preacher’ is actually a global terrorist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-innocent-preacher-is-actually-a-global-terrorist/articleshow/121123757.cms,"Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf (circled), a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League. But it turns out that he was actually Hafiz Abdul Rauf — a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ by the US who is also on SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US govt (AFP photo)





Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.
