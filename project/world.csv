Sethi posted a video of him showing a handwritten note left on another car in a parking lot. The note read: “Sorry for hitting on your left side door”, along with contact details for the car owner to claim damages, adding, “Please contact and claim your damages. ”In the clip, he can be seen explaining why the incident caught his attention. He contrasted the situation with what he believes often happens in India, saying that if someone were to hit another person’s car, they would most likely flee the spot. “In Australia, people are so considerate that the person who caused the damage actually left a note asking the car owner to claim the damages,” he noted. “Just shows you that a country becomes great because of its people. ” He captioned the clip: “Australian people are cute (maybe it was a tourist) But worth sharing.”The clip also drew more emotional responses. One viewer remarked, “Absolutely right, people in our country will kill each other over a damage let alone settling damages.”","Sethi posted a video of him showing a handwritten note left on another car in a parking lot.

'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

Senior party leaders to attend the rally





‘Lacking a neutral umpire,’ says K C Venugopal





Amit Shah vs Rahul Gandhi





NEW DELHI: The Congress will hold a major rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital on Sunday, stepping up its campaign over alleged “vote chori” and the SIR issue, party leaders said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and former party chief Rahul Gandhi are expected to address the rally.Ahead of the rally, senior leaders will assemble at the party’s Indira Bhawan headquarters and proceed together to Ramlila Maidan in a bus.The rally comes days after a fiery debate in the Lok Sabha, during which the government and the Opposition clashed over the special intensive revision of electoral rolls and ""vote chori"" allegations.Senior leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, are also set to participate, while former Congress president Sonia Gandhi is also likely to be present.""Our party has organised the 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' rally at Ramlila Maidan. The Congress party has taken a step towards a decisive battle, and a large number of people will attend this rally,"" Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy is also expected to attend the rally.According to a party spokesperson, 1,027 Congress leaders and activists set out from Jammu on Saturday to attend the rally. The group raised slogans of “vote chore, gaddi chhore” and “Delhi chalo” while en route, as cited by PTI.Jharkhand Congress president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee has undertaken extensive preparations for the rally. Describing the programme as historic, Kamlesh added that party leaders, workers and representatives from across Jharkhand have already arrived in Delhi in large numbers.Congress MP K C Venugopal on Saturday criticised the Election Commission of India, saying the country was “lacking a neutral umpire” to conduct elections. He also referred to earlier press conferences addressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, which highlighted alleged electoral malpractices.""We are lacking a neutral umpire in this country for conducting elections. This is actually very dangerous to democracy. That is why we are going completely for a campaign and movement. The five-crore signature has to be submitted to the President of India. We are seeking an appointment... In Parliament, we also discussed this vote chori issue. Our LoP has given straightforward suggestions. Not only criticising, but we are also providing clear suggestions. ..There are a lot of complaints about the machines, the EVMs. Lakhs of people will participate in that... This is an internal party program,"" Venugopal was quoted as saying by ANI.Venugopal said the Congress has gathered over five crore signatures nationwide to highlight alleged vote theft, calling it a core democratic issue. He alleged the presence of ""bogus"" and duplicate votes, claimed that Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences exposed irregularities favouring the BJP, and said the Election Commission ignored the party’s complaint while instead targeting the Congress.Tensions flared in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday as Union home minister Amit Shah and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sparred over allegations of “vote chori.” Gandhi repeatedly challenged Shah to debate the issues raised during recent press conferences, including claims of irregularities in electoral rolls.Moreover, Rahul launched a sharp attack on the government and the Election Commission, raising three questions that he said demonstrated how the BJP was “directing and using” the EC to undermine India’s democracy.Rahul also put forward a series of proposals, including providing machine-readable voter lists to all political parties a month before elections, scrapping the provision that allows CCTV footage to be destroyed after 45 days, granting access to EVMs, and amending laws that, he alleged, allow election commissioners to “get away with whatever they want to do.”Responding sharply, Shah said Parliament would not function according to Rahull’s wishes and asserted that he would address the questions in his own sequence. He defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter lists, describing it as a necessary exercise to “sanitise” the electoral rolls.Accusing the Opposition of double standards, Shah said the Election Commission was praised after electoral victories but criticised after defeats. The exchange ended with Opposition MPs staging a walkout during Shah’s reply, forcing an adjournment of the House.","Congress will hold a major rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital on Sunday.

The governor has given written permission to the UP government to go ahead in its wholly illegal and unjust attempt to subvert the processes of justice and to withdraw the entire case even though the main witness has already given evidence,” she said in letter.Karat highlighted that the victim’s daughter had already testified in court, naming and identifying all accused, with two other direct witnesses yet to give statements.She alleged that the UP government cited minor grounds such as use of lathis instead of guns, lack of personal animosity, and potential communal tension to justify withdrawing the case. “This is motivated not to meet the ends of justice but to subvert the entire judicial process,” Karat wrote.She also questioned whether the governor had a duty to counsel the state government against such a move.“Should the governor not counsel the government against such a step? Is it not the duty of the governor to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law?” she asked.Karat urged the President to intervene and direct the governor to revoke the permission given to the state to withdraw the case. She noted the urgency, as the government affidavit, approved by the governor, was scheduled to be discussed in court on December 12 but was postponed at the prosecution’s request.The Dadri lynching, which sparked nationwide outrage, occurred after a mob attacked Akhlaq and his son following an alleged temple announcement claiming he had slaughtered a cow.

On the afternoon of December 13, 2001, India witnessed a deadly assault on its democracy. A group of Pakistan-trained terrorists drove into the Parliament complex in a stolen white ambassador car and opened fire, leading to a gun battle that lasted nearly half an hour.For millions who watched the chaos unfolding live on television, the threat of terrorism suddenly felt far more real than ever before. For the first time, what had remained confined to the 'pushed its way to the very periphery ofIt was a day that forced India to confront a question it had not asked so urgently until then. How vulnerable was the soul of Indian democracy?The terrorists, armed with automatic rifles, grenades and explosives, moved with a precision that caught security personnel off guard. They had arrived in an ambassador fitted with a counterfeit home ministry sticker and Parliament labels, a deception that helped them pass through the initial barricades.The suspicious movement of the beacon-fitted white car was first spotted by CRPF's woman constable Kamlesh Kumari and Watch and Ward staff JP Yadav when it entered from the main gate on Parliament Street and started speeding.Both JP Yadav and Kamlesh Kumari ran from gate number 11 to stop it, only to fall to the bullets of theKumari was awarded the Ashok Chakra by the President for her valiant effort. The Ashok Chakra is India’s highest peacetime gallantry award given for exemplary courage and self-sacrifice away from the battlefield.After abandoning the car at gate 11, the terrorists ran towards gate number one, where head constable YB Thapa and constable Sukhvinder Singh, taking guard behind a pillar and a wall, fired at one of the terrorists, a(suicide bomber), who blew himself up.Within minutes, the Parliament complex, typically defined by routine movement during the winter session, was transformed into a war-like zone. Gunfire crackled across the grounds. Smoke drifted through the corridors. Officers scrambled for cover as calls for reinforcements echoed across the compound.Realising they had triggered a full-blown response, the attackers scaled a wall near Gate 11, shed their civilian clothes and revealed olive-green fatigues. Each carried a Kalashnikov assault rifle, ammunition and several grenades.Security forces reacted quickly. Personnel from the CRPF, Delhi Police and Parliament Security cordoned off the area and engaged the gunmen. A fierce gunfight erupted as the terrorists attempted to breach deeper into the complex.The confrontation lasted a little under thirty minutes but left an impact far beyond its duration. One terrorist detonated his suicide vest after being shot by security forces. The others were neutralised before they could enter the main building, where hundreds of Members of Parliament (MPs) were gathered.By the end of the encounter, nine people had died, including six security personnel and gardener Desh Raj, who was caught in the sudden barrage of bullets, along with the five terrorists.Eighteen others were injured, among them twelve security personnel and a television cameraman who had been covering the events of the day.The bravery of the security teams prevented what could have escalated into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Yet the proximity of the attack to the nation’s elected representatives exposed a terrifying reality.India's most protected address had been penetrated with alarming ease!Investigations identified the attackers as Pakistani nationals linked to Hafiz Saeed’s Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Masood Azhar’s Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), two groups that Indian intelligence agencies and global counter-terror networks had already flagged as rising threats in the region.The five terrorists were Hamza, Haider, Rana, Raja and Mohammad, who were trained at the direction of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).The attack was the outcome of a pact between JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar and Zakir-ur-Rehman of LeT, the then Delhi Police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma had said soon after the incident.Indian agencies found strong evidence suggesting that the assault was conceived as a symbolic attack meant to cripple India’s sovereignty. The attackers reportedly intended to storm the main building and take lawmakers hostage or kill them, an outcome that would have pushed the subcontinent into an extreme and unpredictable crisis.The Delhi Police Special Cell took charge of the investigation. Within days, they traced the conspiracy to a network of handlers, facilitators and contacts in Delhi and Kashmir.Mohammed Afzal Guru emerged as the key figure who had arranged logistics for the attackers. He secured the car used in the attack, provided a safe house and coordinated communication between the terrorists and their handlers.His cousin, Shaukat Hussain Guru, along with Shaukat’s wife, Afsan Guru, were arrested for aiding elements of the plot. Delhi University lecturer SAR Geelani was also taken into custody but was later acquitted on appeal.Investigators recovered coded documents, explosives and communication devices from hideouts connected to the group. They also uncovered detailed reconnaissance notes that showed the terrorists had surveyed the Parliament complex days before the attack.Afzal Guru was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death for his role as the main conspirator. After years of legal proceedings and political debate, he was executed in 2013.The Parliament attack led to Operation Parakram, one of the largest military mobilisations on the India-Pakistan border since the 1971 war. Nearly half a million troops were deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border. The two nuclear-armed neighbours stood eyeball to eyeball for almost ten months.India identified Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as the force supporting the terror infrastructure behind the attack. Islamabad, however, denied the charges but faced intense global pressure to take action.General Pervez Musharraf , then Pakistan’s President, condemned terrorism publicly and, in a hogwash attempt, announced a ban on Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other extremist organisations. Musharraf also promised reforms in madrassa regulation, which was, again, a load of baloney.The Parliament attack forced India to rethink its internal security architecture. Parliament received a massive overhaul in surveillance, access control and perimeter security. Agencies adopted more coordinated protocols, and several new counter-terror mechanisms were institutionalised.The attack also exposed weaknesses in intelligence sharing. A series of post-incident reviews led to reforms in how intelligence agencies exchanged information and monitored cross-border terror networks.India’s counter-terror approach became more centralised, structured and technologically driven in the years that followed.Parliament became one of the most heavily guarded zones in the country, with multi-layered access control, biometric passes, expanded CCTV coverage, permanent Quick Reaction Teams and strengthened perimeter checks.Similar upgrades were carried out across other high-security government buildings, including the Seva Teerth (PMO) and Rashtrapati Bhavan.Intelligence-sharing mechanisms between the Intelligence Bureau, R&AW, Delhi Police and state agencies were streamlined to allow real-time information flow.Counter-terror units such as the Special Cell and the National Security Guard saw significant expansion in manpower, training and equipment, with greater emphasis on urban combat readiness, surveillance technology and coordinated response drills.Security forces received modernised weapons, protective gear and communication systems, while airports underwent rigorous audits and enhanced screening protocols to plug vulnerabilities exposed by past terror operations.The passage of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) in 2002 strengthened the legal framework for tackling terror networks and handling terror-related evidence. VIP protection protocols were revised, with tighter security during Parliament sessions and dedicated commando teams for ministers.In 2002, a designated POTA court convicted Afzal Guru of conspiracy and waging war against the nation, holding that the attack could not have been executed without his support, even though he was not part of the armed assault inside Parliament. He was sentenced to death. The same court convicted his cousin, Shaukat Hussain Guru, but acquitted Afsan Guru and SAR Geelani due to the lack of evidence.The Delhi high court upheld Afzal Guru’s death sentence in 2003. In 2005, the Supreme Court confirmed the conviction and sentence, ruling that the chain of circumstantial evidence proved his role in the conspiracy and that the case met the “rarest of rare” standard.Afzal Guru filed a mercy petition with the President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2006. After prolonged delay, the petition was rejected in February 2013. He was executed by hanging at Tihar Jail on February 9, 2013, ending one of India’s most closely scrutinised terror-related legal cases.The execution immediately triggered political reactions across the spectrum over the prolonged delay in carrying out the sentence. While the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government maintained that the hanging followed due legal process, the then home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said all legal and constitutional procedures had been exhausted.Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi also stated that the law had taken its course and urged against politicising the execution.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) welcomed the execution but criticised the government for not acting sooner despite the Supreme Court’s 2005 verdict. Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley described the hanging as “delayed justice,” while then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said it was “better late than never,” questioning why the sentence had remained pending for years.The Parliament attack is not just an event in the archives of India’s national security history. It is a reference point that continues to influence how India perceives, prepares for and responds to terror threats.Every major terror alert, every security drill at critical installations, and every diplomatic exchange with Pakistan carries, somewhere beneath the surface, the weight of December 13, 2001.It remains a reminder of how close India came to a catastrophe that could have altered the country’s constitutional and democratic fabric. It also stands as a testament to the security personnel who prevented that outcome, often at the cost of their own lives.For a generation born after 2001, the Parliament attack may seem like a distant chapter in history. But the recent terror strike in Delhi, after more than a decade, abruptly rekindled that memory, revealing how deeply such attacks have shaped India’s sense of vulnerability, its security framework and its public consciousness.On the evening of November 10, horror pierced through the heart of the Capital. Delhiites followed the development with nerves stretched thin and bated breath as fear surged through the collective memory. Fear that revived chilling reminders of the years when a palpable dread lived rent-free in the subconscious of every citizen, particularly those in metros.The terror incident in the heart of thereopened old wounds from the past, with the attack on Parliament, which is around 6.5 km away from the Red Fort, being the first thought to resurface for many.","A group of Pakistan-trained terrorists drove into the Parliament complex in a stolen white ambassador car and opened fire.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday launched a sharp attack on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee over the chaos at Kolkata’s Salt Lake stadium during Argentine football star Lionel Messi’s appearance, with Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accusing the state government of gross mismanagement and making three demands, including Banerjee ’s resignation.Reacting to the disorder at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan, Adhikari posted on X, saying, ""Shame on you, Mamata Banerjee ! The 'Khela Hobe' Circus Turns into a TMC Loot-Fest at Yuva Bharati ! What a pathetic spectacle in Kolkata today ! Our football-crazed Bengali Fans, dreaming of a glimpse of the GOAT Lionel Messi, shelled out thousands for tickets, only to be treated like second-class citizens in their own state. ""He alleged that while senior Trinamool Congress leaders and their associates surrounded Messi, ordinary fans were left disappointed. ""While Arup Biswas, Sujit Bose, and their bootlicking entourage of 100+ VIP vultures swarmed Messi like leeches on a bloodbath, the real fans? Stuck in galleries, staring at a measly 5-7 minutes on a giant screen ! No direct view, just betrayal,"" he wrote.Adhikari also accused organisers and the state administration of exploiting spectators.""And get this: Water bottles banned inside, forcing desperate fans to cough up ₹200 for a ₹20 bottle? Classic TMC extortion racket !"" he said, adding that the event had been turned into a political photo opportunity and profit exercise. ""This isn't just mismanagement; it's a criminal assault on West Bengal's pride and betrayal of our passionate football lovers. Enough is enough !""Listing his demands, Adhikari said, ""FULL 100% REFUND for every gallery ticket holder, return every paisa you stole,"" called for the ""IMMEDIATE ARREST of Sports Minister Arup Biswas, Fire Minister Sujit Bose, and sham organizer Shatadru Dutta,"" and asserted that ""MAMATA BANERJEE MUST RESIGN for dragging West Bengal's name through the mud on the global stage.""The BJP leader’s remarks came hours after chaos erupted at the stadium, where thousands of fans protested after failing to get a clear view of Messi during the much-publicised event. Messi, accompanied by Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, arrived at the venue around 11.30 am but remained tightly cordoned off by security and VIPs. His brief appearance and early exit sparked anger among spectators, leading to vandalism, slogan-shouting and a police baton charge to control the crowd.Meanwhile, BJP MP and spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi in a press conference said, ""The kind of mismanagement and sophistry took place, ashamed every Indian... Mamata Banerjee tweeted that she is 'deeply disturbed by this event', but I want to clear that it is West Bengal which is deeply devastated under your rule... This is the evidence of the tragic situation the state has reached... Similar situation happened in Bengaluru after IPL and in Tamil Nadu as well. .. This shows that the leadership in these states consider itself above the law... This shows the character of all the leaders of INDI alliance...""Following the incident, Banerjee expressed shock over the mismanagement and ordered a high-level enquiry.

Ticket prices for the event ranged from Rs 4,500 to Rs 10,000, and many fans said they had spent large sums only to leave disappointed.The episode has since escalated into a political flashpoint, with the BJP accusing the Trinamool Congress of turning a marquee sporting event into what Adhikari described as a ""corrupt circus,"" while the state government has promised accountability through a formal probe.",BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari accuses West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of gross mismanagement of Lionel Messi's visit to Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister and ex-Congress leader Ashwani Kumar claimed that there could not be an effective opposition than Congress, however, the party has ""somewhere lost ground.

NEW DELHI: The storm over the chief ministerial post resurfaced again after Congress MLA H A Iqbal Hussain on Saturday claimed that D K Shivakumar will take over the top job on January 6.Hussain said that DKS should be made the chief minister and that CM Siddaramaiah should vacate the post for him. He predicted that “there is a 99 per cent chance” that DKS will become CM on January 6.When asked about the significance of the date, he said, “I don’t know. It’s just a random number. Everybody is saying this. It can either be January 6 or 9. These are the two dates.”Hussain has been demanding that Shivakumar be made the chief minister. On Friday, he had made his wish public.This comes a day after DKS met over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi, amid ongoing speculation about potential leadership changes in the state government.According to news agency PTI sources, the dinner gathering included prominent ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya and Dr M C Sudhakar, and several MLAs, including N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai and K Y Nanjegowda.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar further fuelled speculation after claiming that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after the Congress won a landslide victory in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.Amid the ongoing speculation, the party high command had recently instructed both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to meet over breakfast at each other’s residences. This move was seen as an attempt to pause the leadership tussle between the two leaders.These breakfast meetings were also interpreted as a signal of Siddaramaiah’s continuation as chief minister for the immediate future, particularly ahead of the Belagavi legislature session.","Congress MLA H A Iqbal Hussain on Saturday claimed that D K Shivakumar will take over the top job on January 6.

'Watershed moment'

Tharoor congratulates NDA

'A detailed review will be conducted at all levels'

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA on Saturday made massive gains in Kerala after clinching a majority in the Thiruvananthapuram civic body elections -- held by Left parties for 45 years.Out of 101 wards in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the BJP won 50, the LDF 29, the UDF 19, while two went to independent candidates.Additionally, the NDA retained the Palakkad municipality after a close battle with the Congress-led UDF and wrested the Thrippunithura Municipality from the grand old party.In Thrissur, the BJP won 18 out of the 46 wards in Kodungallur Municipality, eight in Thrissur Corporation, two each in Guruvayoor and Vadakkancherry municipalities, seven in Kunnamkulam Municipality, six in Irinjalakuda Municipality and one in Chalakudy Municipality. It also won four wards in block panchayats and 167 in grama panchayats, but none in the district panchayat in Thrissur district.According to the State Election Commission, the NDA has won 1,402 grama panchayat wards and 53 block panchayat wards across Kerala.These also include 11 wards in the Kollam Corporation, 13 in the Kozhikode Corporation, four in the Kannur Corporation and six in the Kochi Corporation, where it finished third in these local bodies.This comes as the Kerala Assembly election is scheduled for April next year. In the 2021 polls, the BJP had drawn a blank, while the Left Democratic Front retained power with 99 seats. Meanwhile, the United Democratic Front won the remaining 41 seats in the 140-member assembly.Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the mandate received by the BJP-led NDA in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation a “watershed moment” in Kerala politics and expressed gratitude to BJP workers for the “spectacular results”.“Thank you Thiruvananthapuram! The mandate the BJP-NDA got in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is a watershed moment in Kerala’s politics,” he wrote on X.PM Modi said people were certain that the development aspirations of Kerala could only be addressed by the BJP. “Our party will work towards this vibrant city’s growth and boost ‘Ease of Living’ for the people,” he said, using the hashtag #VikasitaThiruvananthapuram.BJP leader Shaun George expressed confidence that the NDA would make gains in central and south Kerala, claiming a shift of traditional UDF and Kerala Congress voters towards the BJP.“We are very confident that the BJP will secure a good margin in the central Kerala belt, and we will also achieve a strong victory this time in south Kerala. People who have traditionally depended on the UDF and Kerala Congress will shift their support to the BJP this time,” he told news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor congratulated the BJP on its historic performance in Kerala, saying the results show a notable shift in the capital’s political landscape.“What a day of amazing results in the Kerala local self-government elections! The mandate is clear, and the democratic spirit of the state shines through,” Tharoor said on X.“A huge congratulations to @UDFKerala for a truly impressive win across various local bodies! This is a massive endorsement and a powerful signal ahead of the state legislative elections. Hard work, a strong message and anti-incumbency have all clearly paid off to achieve a much better result than in 2020,” the Congress MP said.“I also want to acknowledge the historic performance of the BJP in Thiruvananthapuram, and offer humble congratulations on their significant victory in the city Corporation — a strong showing that marks a notable shift in the capital’s political landscape. I campaigned for a change from 45 years of LDF misrule, but the voters have ultimately rewarded another party that also sought a clear change in governance,” he added.CPM state secretary MV Govindan expressed shock over the result and said a detailed review will be conducted at all levels and necessary corrections will be made.""The LDF has suffered an unexpected setback. A detailed review will be conducted at all levels and necessary corrections will be made. The LDF in Kerala has a history of moving forward by making timely course corrections, and it had effectively overcome the defeat of 2010,"" He said.""There has been no fundamental erosion in the base of the Left Democratic Front. The UDF contested the elections by aligning with communal forces. There were instances where UDF votes went to the BJP and BJP votes were transferred to defeat the LDF,"" he added.""Despite claims of a BJP victory in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the party failed to make significant gains elsewhere. The LDF has won the Pandalam Municipality, which includes key centres linked to Sabarimala. In the previous local body elections, the LDF had secured a massive victory, and the state government has delivered unparalleled achievements to Kerala. Why these achievements did not translate into electoral gains needs to be examined. Possible organisational shortcomings will also be reviewed in detail. The party will reach out more to the people and move forward. By analysing the setbacks in the elections and making necessary corrections, the LDF will overcome this phase. If there was strong anti-LDF sentiment, how could the front have won seven district panchayats?” he further said.","BJP-led NDA makes massive gains in Kerala after clinching majority in civic body elections.

No Pak film made on Lyari because those behind violence still in power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-pak-film-made-on-lyari-because-those-behind-violence-still-in-power/articleshow/125952289.cms,".

1. You have done more than a decade of fieldwork in

Lyari

, written multiple articles and even made a documentary. How did you first get drawn into Lyari as a research site?

2. Lyari’s tumultuous gang history has rarely featured in mainstream Pakistani cinema. Why have

filmmakers

stayed away?

3. There are stories of how

Rehman Dakait

ordered his associates to play football with the severed heads of rival gang members. Does the film’s portrayal of Dakait as the terrifying overlord of the area capture reality?

4. What aspects of Lyari life does your documentary ‘Shadowlands’ highlight—stories that rarely find space next to gang sensationalism?

5. Has the area got a makeover? It’s produced quite a few hip hop stars in the last few years, including female rappers.

6. ‘Dhurandhar’ has divided viewers both in India and Pakistan. It has even been banned in the Gulf.

7. You have studied feminist movements in both India and Pakistan, and in Lyari you did set out to show that feminism is not a dull, bleak affair and can be fun. Tell us about that.

8. You have written about how more women are participating in the fight for Baloch rights. To what extent has social media enabled this shift?

Interestingly, it was my PhD research, which I conducted in the area of Zakir Nagar in Delhi in the early 2000s, that drew me to Lyari. When I first visited Lyari in 2012, I realised that many of the issues I had explored in Zakir Nagar — such as the experiences of marginalisation and stigmatisation of Muslims in Delhi — were echoed by the residents there. Both Zakir Nagar and Lyari were considered dens of crime and terrorism by mainstream media, but the reality was far more complex.While the discrimination in Zakir Nagar was related largely to religious identity, the marginalisation in Lyari was connected more with ethnicity and class. I was drawn to the stories narrated by the residents of this area and by the diversity, vibrancy and rich history of this neighbourhood — an area proudly called ‘Karachi ki maan’ (the pride of Karachi) — by those who call it home.Perhaps the main reason Lyari’s conflict has not been the subject of a feature film or drama series in Pakistan is that those largely responsible for the violence are still in power —namely, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the military establishment, both of whom used Lyari for their own political purposes. The PPP countered the city’s most powerful political party at the time, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), by allying with criminal gangs in Lyari, thus strengthening their power.Furthermore, approximately 50% of Lyari’s 1.5 million residents are Baloch, and the area has long been an important site for Baloch political organising. Many residents believe that the military has an interest in supporting the gangs to counter Baloch nationalism in the area.‘Dhurandhar’ seems to be almost completely based on fantasy. The only thing the film gets right is the fact that Rehman Dakait existed and that he was powerful. However, Rehman is not remembered as a terrifying monster by residents of the area. While he was certainly feared and known to have a great capacity for violence, he was also respected by many in the community and was seen as a kind of Robin Hood figure who supported members of his community through charitable initiatives and social work.When he died, the country’s greatest philanthropist, Abdul Sattar Edhi, even attended his funeral. By the time the infamous football incident took place in 2013, Rehman had long been dead. This brutal act was ordered by Uzair Baloch along with another famous gangster, Baba Ladla.Karachi has gone through many cycles of violence over the past decades. In general, those in power allow the violence to continue as long as it suits their interests. When it starts to go out of their control, an ‘operation’ is launched to return the monopoly of violence back to the state. This is what happened in Lyari as well in 2013. While the dominant narrative after the ‘Karachi Operation’ was that peace had returned to Lyari and Karachi as a whole, few spoke of the thousands of people whose lives had been upended by the violence.‘Shadowlands’ tells the story of two people who lost members of their families during the conflict, either in encounter killings or in inter-gang violence. It shows how the scars of violence continue to colour the lives of residents after the conflict officially subsided and how the seeds of conflict — drugs, poverty, unemployment, and state neglect — remain in the area.One problem with ‘Dhurandhar’ is that it flattens the diversity and vibrancy of the area. Lyari has always been a hub for art and culture. It has also been influenced by global trends, particularly those tied to the African diaspora because it is home to many people who trace their origins to the African continent. I imagine hip hop and rap music resonated with the youth of Lyari because of cultural, political and social similarities shared with other urban areas globally where local forms of the genre have also emerged. In this sense, I would not say Lyari has had a makeover, but the relative peace following the years of gang war has certainly opened a space for art and culture to flourish in the area once again.Although I am not sure exactly what led to the ban, this reflects the growing resentment of Pakistanis (including those in the diaspora) to the caricatured and inaccurate depiction of their country in Bollywood films. Rehman Dakait’s entry song is actually in Arabic, which is not one of Pakistan’s indigenous languages, even if many learn it for religious purposes. It would make much more sense to have a song in Urdu or even Balochi. Arabic only feeds into the orientalist imagination of Pakistan as an ‘Islamic’ and, hence, ‘Arabised’ nation. Such exotic representations reinforce perceptions of Pakistanis as ‘other’.My work on feminism and fun in Lyari was an attempt to demonstrate how the women of Lyari (and women in Pakistan and Muslim women more generally) are not passive victims of violence. Rather, women and girls in Lyari push the boundaries of gender norms in their pursuit of fun and leisure, through quiet, everyday acts of resistance. They might not call this ‘feminism’, but that is not important. What is important is that they are challenging gender boundaries in multiple ways, which are also worth studying.I have researched how Baloch women involved with the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) have been struggling for an end to state violence in Balochistan and for the rights of the Baloch people. They have emerged as leaders of their movement, and this has been partially facilitated by social media. Photos of women leaders such as Mahrang Baloch, who is currently in jail, and videos of their speeches, protests, and rallies are shared widely on various social media platforms. This has inspired other women and girls to join and has allowed the movement to expand and gain support within the province, nationally, and on a global scale.",Lyari’s tumultuous gang history has rarely featured in mainstream Pakistani cinema. ‘Dhurandhar’ has divided viewers both in India and Pakistan. It has even been banned in the Gulf. The only thing the film gets right is the fact that Rehman Dakait existed and that he was powerful.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125952286,imgsize-1024050,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-12.jpg"

PATNA: About a month after she broke off relations with her family, RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, signalled there was further strain when she appealed to Bihar's govt to ensure that every woman can stay safely in her parental home. Rohini, who lives in Singapore, had donated her kidney to her father Lalu in Dec 2022 for transplant at a Singapore hospital.In a social media post on Thursday, she indirectly praised chief minister Nitish Kumar for distributing Rs 10,000 among women and giving cycles to schoolgirls, but said these steps were inadequate. Rohini said that in Bihar, a deeply rooted patriarchal mindset creates the need for widespread change in both social and political spheres.""Every daughter has the right to grow up with the assurance that her parental home is a safe place, where she can return without fear, guilt, shame, or having to explain herself to anyone,"" she wrote on X, asserting implementing this measure is not just an ""administrative duty"" but a step towards saving countless women from future exploitation and harassment.Her observation comes about a month after she quit RJD and disowned her family members following a verbal spat, allegedly with her brother Tejashwi Yadav over RJD's assembly election disaster. She also alleged she was accused of donating a ""dirty kidney"" to her father after ""extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket"".","Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, has voiced concerns about women's safety in Bihar.

Why will we run away from own country: Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than nine months pregnant now, and visibly exhausted, Sunali Khatun's voice carried a strange mix of tired resolve and simmering anger when she spoke to TOI on Thursday. ""I'm tired from inside. The worst part is that despite showing all documents, no one listened to us,"" she said, fighting back tears.The 26-year-old domestic worker from Paikar village in West Bengal's Birbhum district was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini in late June this year. Sunali said she and her husband, Danish Sekh, immediately produced every document they had - Aadhaar, PAN and ration card. ""I even quickly presented my in-laws' ID proofs arranged over WhatsApp the same night."" Nothing worked.We did everything in our power,"" Sunali said. ""We showed every single document. We kept telling them, 'We are not Bangladeshi. We are Indian.' Who will listen to people like us?""Within 48 hours, on June 26, after the Foreigners Regional Registration Office deportation order, police seized the couple's belongings from their Rohini jhuggi and took them and their eight-year-old son, Sabir Sekh, to Guwahati.From there, she said, they were pushed across the Bangladesh border in hot haste.The deportation was sudden and unexpected for the couple and their families back in West Bengal. For the next five months, Sunali was trapped in a maze of suspicion. What followed, she says, ""broke something inside her.""After filing a missing-person complaint at his local Palkar police station on 6 July 2025, Sunali's father, Bhodu Sekh, moved the Calcutta HC three days later. On 9 July 2025, his habeas corpus petition seeking production of his daughter, son-in-law and grandson was registered.With no information from authorities & fearing his heavily pregnant daughter might be left to deliver without medical help in an unknown country, Bhodu filed pleading for urgent intervention. In his petition, he, too, said family had supplied Aadhaar, voter IDs, PAN cards and land records to show their Indian roots, yet authorities deported them.Back in Bangladesh, the time there for Sunali and her family were a blur of hunger, fear and humiliation. ""We remained in hell. We didn't even have Rs 5 to feed our children,"" she said. ""We had a single set of clothes, my yellow kurta and blue salwar. My son his red T-shirt and black half-pants. For food & shelter, there was the mercy of strangers.""When they initially attempted to return a few days after entering Bangladesh, she says the Indian side beat them brutally despite their pleas. ""We were profiled simply because we were Bengali-speaking Muslims.""When produced before a Bangladeshi court, Sunali says she expected questions about who they were, how they crossed, why they were there. But it was over in minutes. ""They didn't ask us anything, just put us in jail,"" she said. ""Humne sirf bola hum Bharat ke hain. Documents hote hue koi kyun bhejega? Wo log bhi hairaan thhe. (We only said in court there that we are from India. Why will we run away from our own country when we possess valid papers. They, too, were surprised)."" Sunali described the months in the jail as ""mental torture"".Though she is home for now, Sunali says her heart is heavy with fear & foreboding. ""Are there any other documents we can get? What if we are shoved out again? I can't sleep thinking about that.""","Sunali Khatun was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini.

Army teams continue to search for the other two workers.It wasn't immediately clear if the critically injured survivor included the truck driver among the 22 that he said were involved in the crash, officials said. He has been shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh, around 260km from Hayuliang.Nang Chingni Choupoo, in charge of the Anjaw district disaster management department, told TOI that Army teams used ropes to descend into the deep gorge and trace the wreckage. The 19 bodies found so far are still to be brought up.""Since the Army personnel do not have specialised equipment to carry the bodies, an NDRF team from Dibrugarh is being sent there with the required equipment.The operation will resume Friday morning,"" Choupoo said. ""For now, we are assuming there were 22 people, unless the driver wasn't counted. The mangled truck lies upside down and rescuers need to cut through the metal to determine if anyone is trapped inside.""The Assam govt has deputed a joint team of the Tinsukia civil and police administration to travel to the area and coordinate with Army and Arunachal Pradesh officials. The nearest camp, which the injured survivor reached, belongs to the General Reserve Engineer Force under which BRO operates.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said both states were working closely to rescue survivors, if any, and get the victims' bodies home.Defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat said multiple search and rescue columns of the Army, medical teams, GREF representatives, local police and NDRF personnel worked for hours to locate the wreckage and the bodies.Initial reports suggested the workers were from Tinsukia and travelling to Chaglagam for work. The road where the accident occurred is steep and has a single lane.","The victims - 19 bodies had been retrieved until Thursday evening - were all labourers from Assam being ferried to a site in Anjaw district, bordering China.

Who is Paige Shiver and why her name surfaced during the Michigan–Sherrone Moore controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-paige-shiver-and-why-her-name-surfaced-during-the-michigansherrone-moore-controversy/articleshow/125928237.cms,"Paige Shiver’s background and football ties

How Paige Shiver's name appeared online

What Michigan has officially said

How social media turned a name into a talking point

The role of family connections

Where things stand now

The name Paige Shiver has recently surfaced in online discussions around Michigan football, drawing attention far beyond college sports circles. While speculation on social media has been intense, official statements from the university have not named her in connection with any wrongdoing. What is confirmed so far is limited, and much of the attention appears to be driven by online chatter rather than verified findings.So who is Paige Shiver, and why has her name entered the public conversation?Paige Shiver is known to have worked in a support or administrative capacity within Michigan’s football program. Her role was not a coaching or decision-making position, and the university has not publicly detailed her responsibilities.She is also the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a long-serving NFL scout with the Chicago Bears, a connection that has added to public curiosity but has no stated link to Michigan’s ongoing issues.Until recently, Shiver maintained a low public profile and was not a known figure outside football operations circles.During broader scrutiny involving Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore and program-level matters, Paige Shiver’s name began circulating on social media and some digital platforms.Importantly, the university has not identified any individual staff member by name in relation to the controversy.Much of the discussion referencing Shiver has been framed by unverified online speculation, rather than official disclosures.At this stage, there is no public record of misconduct, disciplinary action, or formal accusation involving her.Michigan officials have kept statements focused on institutional processes, cooperation with reviews, and compliance matters. No communication from the university has singled out Paige Shiver or suggested she played a role in any alleged violation.Experts familiar with NCAA and university compliance processes note that staff names can surface informally during periods of scrutiny, even when those individuals are not subjects of investigations.Once Paige Shiver’s name started circulating online, it spread quickly across social media. People shared old photos and bits of information, and many jumped to conclusions without waiting for confirmed details.Experts say this is common today. When a big sports program faces scrutiny, even support staff and people who are not public figures can get dragged into the spotlight. Several commentators have warned that online attention should not be mistaken for responsibility, especially when no official findings or statements have been released.Paige Shiver’s relationship to Jeff Shiver, a veteran NFL scout, has fueled additional interest. However, there has been no indication that her family background has any relevance to Michigan’s situation. Observers note that family ties often heighten attention online, even when unrelated to the facts under review.At this stage, the focus of official scrutiny remains at the program and institutional level. Shiver has not been identified by Michigan as an involved party, and no authoritative source has presented verified allegations against her.","Paige Shiver is known to have worked in a support or administrative capacity within Michigan’s football program.

"Epstein cache surfaces: House panel unveils 19 fresh photos; Trump, Clinton, Bill Gates appear in new images",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-cache-surfaces-house-panel-unveils-19-fresh-photos-trump-clinton-bill-gates-appear-in-new-images/articleshow/125937405.cms,"'I Know Nothing, Many Were…’: Trump Reacts To New Epstein Estate Leaked Photos





NEW DELHI: House Oversight Committee Democrats on Friday released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, revealing images of several high-profile figures who had interacted with the disgraced financier over the years, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and others.The photos, 19 in total, were part of a larger cache of more than 95,000 images the estate turned over to congressional investigators. While many of the individuals shown had previously been linked to Epstein, the newly released images offered additional glimpses into their associations. None of the photographs depicted sexual misconduct or involved underage girls, and it remained unclear when or where they were taken.Among the images was a bowl of novelty condoms featuring a caricature of Trump labelled “Trump condom 4.50,” with each packet printed with the phrase “I’m HUUUUGE!” Another showed Trump with a group of women whose faces were redacted. Additional photos included Epstein and Steve Bannon posing in a mirror, Bill Clinton alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Bill Gates with the former Prince Andrew, and images of former Harvard President Larry Summers and attorney Alan Dershowitz.The Republican-led committee had obtained the images as part of its ongoing probe into Epstein’s network and influence. Lawyers for the estate told the panel in a letter that the materials spanned photos and videos taken at any property owned or used by Epstein between 1990 and 2019. They added that only minimal redactions had been applied for nudity. Democrats said the production included “over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” as well as thousands of images of women and Epstein properties.Rep Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said, “It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends. These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW. ”Republicans pushed back, accusing Democrats of selectively releasing images to create a misleading narrative about Trump. A committee spokesperson said, “We received over 95,000 photos and Democrats released just a handful. Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we have received shows any wrongdoing. It is shameful Rep Garcia and Democrats continue to put politics above justice for the survivors. ”CNN has reached out to representatives for Trump, Clinton, Bannon, Gates, Summers, Dershowitz, Richard Branson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein, and his spokesperson has said he severed ties well before Epstein’s 2019 arrest. Gates’ representatives have also repeatedly denied that Epstein ever worked for him, and Gates has previously called his interactions with Epstein “a huge mistake. ”Trump and his aides have portrayed the renewed focus on his past connection to Epstein as politically motivated. In earlier emails released by the committee, Epstein claimed that Trump “spent hours” with accuser Virginia Giuffre and “knew about the girls,” assertions Trump has dismissed as false, with White House officials calling the claims a “hoax.”The fallout from associations with Epstein has extended far beyond politics. Larry Summers stepped back from teaching at Harvard and left the OpenAI board, saying he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining ties with Epstein. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor relinquished the use of his royal titles after public scrutiny intensified, though he has denied misconduct allegations.The latest disclosures add to the growing trove of documents, emails and images shaping the committee’s widening inquiry into the late financier’s network of influence, which continues to cast a shadow over figures across politics, academia, technology and global business.","House Oversight Committee Democrats released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate.

Former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore is facing a series of serious legal charges after being arrested earlier this week, just hours before the university abruptly announced his dismissal. The case has quickly become one of the most shocking off-field episodes of the college football season, prompting widespread scrutiny of the allegations and the circumstances surrounding his firing.Here is a detailed look at what Moore has been charged with, the penalties involved and what happens next.The most serious charge Moore faces is third-degree home invasion, a felony under Michigan law. Authorities allege that Moore unlawfully entered the apartment of a woman identified only as someone he “has or has had a dating relationship” with.According to the prosecutor, Moore’s behaviour inside the residence raised significant concern. In a court hearing, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Kati Rezmierski said Moore allegedly entered the kitchen, grabbed several butter knives and scissors and threatened to harm himself, making statements such as, “I’m going to kill myself. I’m going to make you watch.”A third-degree home invasion conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a $2,000 fine, or both.The allegation forms the foundation of the case and was a major factor in Michigan’s decision to terminate his contract.Moore also faces a misdemeanor charge of stalking, tied to what authorities describe as repeated unwanted contact with the victim after the end of their relationship. Michigan law defines this as conduct that would cause emotional distress or fear in the targeted individual.If convicted, Moore could face up to one year in jail, a $1,000 fine, and as much as five years of probation. Prosecutors described his actions as “highly threatening and highly intimidating” based on police body-camera footage reviewed before the arraignment.The third charge, entering without permission, is another misdemeanor. It stems from Moore allegedly forcing his way into the victim’s residence without lawful authority. This charge carries a penalty of up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine.The combination of a felony and two misdemeanors paints a severe legal picture, though Moore’s attorney, Joe Simon, has argued that his client is not a public-safety threat and that he has not yet reviewed the evidence being cited.Moore spent two nights in jail before a judge set his bond at $25,000 cash/surety, with several strict conditions:His next court appearance is scheduled for January 22, 2026, due to the holiday calendar.Moore’s sudden downfall comes less than a year into his head-coaching tenure, which began after Jim Harbaugh’s departure. The Wolverines have appointed Biff Poggi as interim coach while beginning a full search for a permanent replacement.As the legal process unfolds, the focus now shifts to how these charges will develop in court and how Michigan moves forward after one of the most unexpected scandals in program history.","Former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore is facing a series of serious legal charges after being arrested earlier this week.

GUWAHATI: Assam Police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Friday filed a 3,500 page charge sheet in a Guwahati court in connection with the death of celebrated singer Zubeen Garg, who died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in Singapore on September 19.

The SIT, operating under the CID, was constituted after more than 60 FIRs were lodged across the state demanding a thorough investigation.Zubeen Garg, born on November 18, 1972, in Tura, Meghalaya, hailed from an Assamese family deeply rooted in his ancestral village, Tamulichiga in Jhanji, Jorhat. Despite a career that took him across India and abroad, the singer remained emotionally connected to the culture, people, and vibrant ethos of Assam and the Northeast.As part of the probe, an SIT delegation led by Special DGP (CID) Munna Prasad Gupta met Singapore authorities on October 21.So far, the team has recorded statements from more than 300 individuals.The SIT has arrested seven people during the investigation — main event organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Zubeen’s manager Siddharth Sharma, his cousin Sandipan Garg, bandmate Shekhar Jyoti Goswami, co-singer Amritprava Mahanta, and his PSOs Nandeswar Bora and Paresh Baishya.

US: Deadly Shootout At Brown University; Shooter ‘Hiding Inside Campus’, Mega Hunt On After 2 Killed

What happened?

Massive manhunt on









Providence police said they still have no clear lead into the shooting reported at Brown University, hours after the incident, as questions were raised about what authorities and university officials knew in its aftermath.Officials said that no suspect is currently in custody, contradicting an earlier statement from the university that one person had been detained.During a press interaction, a reporter questioned the university president about the lack of information regarding what occurred inside the classroom where the shooting took place. The reporter pointed out that six hours had passed since the incident and asked how details might still have been unavailable.In response, Brown University President Christina H Paxson said she ""did not know"" the details of the shooting, as of yet.When asked whether there was video footage from inside the building during the shooting, Providence police said they do not possess any video that “depicts” the shooter so far.“I haven’t seen him on video inside that building,” an official said, addressing the press.Officials at the scene also could not provide information on how many people were inside the building or the reasons for their presence.Police have announced that they will release a video of the suspect.Two people were killed and nine others injured in a shooting on Saturday afternoon at Brown University’s Barus & Holley building in Providence, Rhode Island, officials confirmed.According to a Brown University Health spokesperson, of the nine injured, one is in stable condition, six are critical but stable, and another has been stabilized. The ninth victim sustained fragment injuries that are not considered life-threatening.The shooting was first reported around 4.00 pm (local time), prompting the university to send an alert instructing students and faculty to lock doors, silence phones, and remain hidden due to reports of an active shooter. Many students took refuge in their dorms, while others sought shelter in the basement of a popular tea shop.The shooting took place in a classroom inside Brown University’s Barus & Holley building, which houses the engineering and physics departments. Mayor Brett Smiley said finals were ongoing in the building at the time, but officials have not confirmed what was happening in the specific classroom where the incident occurred.Officials described the shooter as a male wearing all black, who fled from the Barus & Holley engineering and physics building on the Hope Street side, as cited by NBC News.Investigators have not yet determined how the shooter gained access to the first-floor classroom. While the building’s outer doors were unlocked, rooms used for final exams required badge access, the mayor noted. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities believe the shooter was armed with a handgun, as reported by AP.On Saturday night, the Brown University campus took on the appearance of a fortified zone as more than 400 law enforcement officers converged on the area. Some officers searched for the gunman, using flashlights to inspect parked cars.US President Donald Trump stated on social media that he had been briefed on the shooting and confirmed that the FBI was present at the scene.”Rhode Island governor Dan McKee said he had spoken with FBI Director Kash Patel and that local, state, and federal law enforcement officers were all actively searching for the gunman.“The unthinkable has happened,” McKee said. ""Everyone is working under the same goal right now -- to keep everybody in that area safe, and also to pursue.""Mayor Brett Smiley said a shelter-in-place order remains in effect and urged residents near the campus to stay indoors or avoid returning home until it is lifted. Streets that are usually busy on weekends were unusually quiet.","Two people were killed and nine others injured in a shooting on Saturday afternoon at Brown University’s Barus & Holley building in Providence, Rhode Island.

CHENNAI: YouTuber Savukku Shankar was arrested on Saturday by the Adambakkam police after he refused to cooperate with an inquiry and remained locked inside a house on Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road for nearly five hours, prompting officers to break open the door with assistance from the Tambaram fire and rescue services personnel.Police said Shankar had been summoned for questioning in a case registered at the Adambakkam police station, in which he and others were accused of assaulting a man and extorting ₹2 lakh at his office.A warrant had been issued last month after he failed to appear for the inquiry. Despite receiving the notice, he did not present himself before the police.A special team led by the Adambakkam assistant commissioner of police reached the residence on Saturday morning.

Erika Kirk accuses Candace Owens of profiting from conspiracy theories in viral CBS clip





Erika Kirk no longer hides her frustration. More than three months after the killing of her husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk , his widow has stepped into the public arena with a message shaped by grief and resolve. What began as quiet mourning has turned into a firm stand against conspiracy theories that refuse to fade. A recent television appearance captured that shift in real time and sent a clip racing across social media.The moment was brief but striking. As Erika Kirk sat for a CBS News interview, her calm expression changed instantly when Candace Owens’ name surfaced. Laughter stopped. Her gaze hardened. Viewers described it as a death stare, but the meaning was clear. For Kirk, this was not a media moment. It was a line being drawn.In the upcoming CBS primetime special with editor in chief Bari Weiss, Erika Kirk directly confronted the narratives surrounding Charlie Kirk’s death. She accused Owens of amplifying false claims and exploiting tragedy for personal gain. Speaking plainly, Kirk said, “She has been one of the main peddlers of these conspiracies.”Her criticism did not stop there. As the discussion turned to motives and monetization, Kirk added, “She is making a huge amount of money on it.She is building her business off these lies.” The comments landed with force, reflecting months of anger that had stayed largely private until now.Owens, a prominent conservative commentator known for challenging official accounts, has repeatedly questioned the circumstances of Charlie Kirk’s killing. She has suggested it was a targeted hit and claimed access to secret sources. Those statements, according to Erika Kirk, have deepened her family’s pain and fueled online speculation.When asked what she wanted Owens and others spreading misinformation to do, Kirk did not hesitate. Her answer was short and unmistakable. “Stop. That’s it. Stop.”Beyond the viral clip, Kirk also spoke about forgiveness, privacy, and the decision to keep parts of her family’s life shielded from public view. She emphasized that grief does not require performance and truth does not need exaggeration.As debates continue online, Erika Kirk’s message stands apart. It is not about politics or clicks. It is about drawing boundaries and demanding humanity in the aftermath of loss.Also Read: Candace Owens drops bombshell claim that Tyler Robinson did not act alone in Charlie Kirk killing as court case intensifies","Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, has publicly denounced Candace Owens for allegedly profiting from conspiracy theories surrounding her husband's death.

Candace Owens' 9/11 style attack post resurfaces after Brown University shooting





Shock and grief swept through Providence after a deadly shooting near Brown University left at least two people dead and several others critically injured. As authorities worked through an active investigation and enforced a shelter in place order, social media took a darker turn. Amid the chaos, an old post by conservative commentator Candace Owens resurfaced, pulling the tragedy into a separate storm of online speculation.The renewed attention on Owens’ past remark quickly shifted the focus from victims and public safety to debate and outrage. Some users framed the resurfaced post as a prediction, while others pushed back hard, warning against drawing reckless conclusions during an unfolding crisis. The moment highlighted how quickly tragedy can be swept into ideological battles, often before facts have a chance to settle.The controversy centers on a previous X post by Owens that some online users linked to the Brown University shooting. In that post, Owens wrote, “They have been signaling that a 9/11 style attack is coming the second week of December. Save this tweet. It will age well.” The message did not cite evidence or name specific threats, but its reappearance sparked fierce debate.Critics were quick to point out the sharp differences between the September 11 attacks and the Providence shooting. One user questioned the logic outright, asking, “How would this make her right.” Others went further, speculating about foreknowledge without offering proof. Another post read, “Did #CandaceOwens know ? #brownuniversity shooting ? Terrorist attack ?.”Law enforcement has not identified a suspect or motive, and officials have made no connection between the shooting and terrorism. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed federal involvement, stating, “FBI personnel are on the scene and assisting this evening after the shooting at Brown University and we will provide all capabilities necessary. Please pray for all those involved. We will update with more information as we are able. ”As the investigation continues, the episode serves as a reminder of how quickly grief can be overshadowed by speculation. For now, authorities urge patience, restraint, and focus on the victims, not viral narratives built in the absence of facts.Also Read: Candace Owens drops bombshell claim that Tyler Robinson did not act alone in Charlie Kirk killing as court case intensifies","A deadly shooting near Brown University has led to a shelter-in-place order and a resurfaced post by conservative commentator Candace Owens.

Candace Owens' Tyler Robinson claims raise fresh doubts in Charlie Kirk case





Candace Owens has once again pushed herself to the center of a national firestorm, reviving questions that many believed were settled. As Tyler Robinson made his first in person appearance in a Utah courtroom, the legal case surrounding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk took on a sharper political and media edge. What unfolded inside the courtroom was serious. What followed online was explosive.Robinson, a 22 year old Utah man, faces aggravated murder and several related charges tied to the September 10 shooting at Utah Valley University. Prosecutors maintain he acted alone. Owens disagrees. Her renewed claims have fueled debate across social media, cable news, and political circles, adding pressure to an already volatile case. As cameras rolled under strict court rules, the trial moved forward under intense public scrutiny.The courtroom scene itself was tightly controlled. Robinson appeared in civilian clothes, restrained but composed, smiling briefly toward family members as Judge Tony F. Graf Jr. emphasized the presumption of innocence. Outside the courtroom, however, the narrative fractured.Owens addressed the controversy directly on social media, dismissing online speculation based on courtroom footage.She rejected interpretations drawn from lip reading videos and facial expressions, calling those reports fictional. According to Owens, Robinson’s reaction in court had nothing to do with guilt or secret signals.She said Robinson and his attorney had just learned that their security vehicle had been involved in a minor crash, a situation she claimed had occurred before. Owens also challenged prosecutors to back up their case publicly. While she stated she believes Robinson was involved on September 10, she drew a clear line beyond that.Owens said she does not believe Robinson pulled the trigger and does not believe he acted alone. Her remarks directly contradict statements from prosecutors, who have said the evidence shows Robinson acted by himself. The state is seeking the death penalty, raising the stakes even higher.Judge Graf allowed cameras in court but imposed limits after concerns that earlier footage showed restraints and private defense discussions. Media groups argued transparency protects public trust, while Robinson’s legal team warned coverage could taint a jury pool.Meanwhile, Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow and CEO of Turning Point USA, has called for transparency while condemning conspiracy theories. She defended the legal process and criticized public figures who, in her view, inflamed speculation.As the case heads toward its next hearing, the courtroom remains one arena. The public debate, driven by powerful voices, shows no signs of quieting down.Also Read: Candace Owens’ war with TPUSA leadership turns personal after Tyler Bowyer’s divorce jab","Candace Owens has reignited controversy surrounding the Charlie Kirk killing, challenging prosecutors' claims that Tyler Robinson acted alone.

Indian-origin semi driver Kamalpreet Singh, believed to be an illegal immigrant, staying in the US without any valid documentation, was released on bond after he was charged with vehicular homicide. The bond amount was set at $100,000. A major outrage started against Indian-origin drivers behind the wheel in the US, taking lives recklessly and then walking free.29-year-old Robert B Pearson was killed as his car was crushed between two trucks on SR 167. Troopers said three vehicles were traveling in lane one when two of them stopped for traffic and a third failed to slow in time. A 2020 Freightliner Cascadia semi driven by 25-year-old Kamalpreet Singh of Elk Grove, California, struck the rear of a blue 2010 Mazda 3 sedan that had stopped behind a white 2016 Peterbilt truck. The Freightliner overrode the back of the Mazda and pushed it under the rear of the Peterbilt.The engine of Robert's car caught fire and he died at the scene. Singh and the Peterbilt driver were not injured. All three drivers were wearing seat belts. The collision blocked the roadway for 6 hours and 48 minutes. The State Patrol said drugs and alcohol were not involved, and the cause of the collision remains under investigation.""My brother was the one killed. Leaving being his wife and 2 young boys ages 4 and 1. They are absolutely suing the company, her family has lawyers on it already.

He crossed the border illegally in 2023 and was released into the US.Troopers determined Singh made no attempt to brake or take evasive action before striking the stopped vehicles. Singh falsified his electronic logbook by listing a co-driver and including data that investigators said could indicate the logbook was altered or disconnected.Social media users reacted sharply to his release and bond and questioned who could pay such an amount for an illegal immigrant. ""Of course he was.. because illegals can just come up with $100K. How is that?"" one wrote.""Where did he get bond money? Who issued his license? Who hired him? Who verified his legal status?

When JD Vance said H-1B didn't make any sense to him





Vice President JD Vance reacted to the new H-1B row as states now challenge the Donald Trump administration's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, and said the states can instead try hiring Americans. Vance was reacting to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield's social media post on suing the new fee, calling it illegal. Dan Rayfield said the new fee would create a costly barrier for employers, especially public sector and government employers who can't pay such a fee if they want to hire from outside.""You might try hiring Americans,"" the vice president posted, giving a solution to the H-1B problem Dan Rayfield raised.""This is instructive, though. While I know there are many people in our coalition who--rightly--are angry about immigration fraud in our visa system, America Last Republicans and Democrats are teaming up to stop our efforts to address these issues. Don't black pill. Fight back,"" JD Vance said.California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Nevada are the 20 states challenging the H-1B visa fee.""The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including Oregon, where the flagship universities consistently depend on H-1B visa holders to fill faculty, researcher, and staff roles. For example, Oregon State University currently sponsors more than 150 H-1B faculty, researchers, and staff, and intends to hire additional faculty, researchers, and staff through the H-1B program. Eliminating access to H-1B faculty, researchers, and staff would inflict significant institutional harm, depriving students of critical educational opportunities,"" Dan Rayfield said.Rayfield said the University of Oregon sponsors more than 50 H-1B faculty, researchers and staff. An initial H-1B petition takes between $960 to $7,595 in regulatory and statutory fees. ""The Trump Administration’s $100,000 fee far exceeds the actual cost of processing H-1B petitions. By imposing this fee, the Administration is exceeding the fee-setting authority granted by Congress, which requires that fees be set based on the agency’s costs, rather than arbitrarily,"" Rayfield said.JD Vance is known for his strong stand against H-1B. Recently, he rapped tech companies for laying off Americans and hiring foreigners. He said it did not make any sense to him. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me. That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bullshit story,"" Vance said earlier this year.","20 states are challenging the Donald Trump administration's $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

Trump says 'will retaliate'

.





Two US service members and one American civilian were killed, and three other US troops injured, in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman in central Syria on Saturday, US Central Command said.In a post on X, CENTCOM, an American military arm that looks after operations in the Middle East, said the Americans were targeted during a visit by US forces near the historic town of Palmyra.“Two US service members and one US civilian were killed, and three service members were injured, as a result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria. The gunman was engaged and killed,” the statement said.The attack marks the first incident to cause US casualties in Syria since the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad a year ago. CENTCOM said the identities of the deceased service members would be withheld for 24 hours, in line with Department of War policy, until their next of kin are notified.Syrian state media SANA reported that shots were fired at Syrian and American forces, wounding several people. The injured were evacuated by helicopter to the US-run al-Tanf garrison near the Syria-Iraq-Jordan border. SANA said the attacker was killed, without giving further details.A US defence official told the Ap that authorities were aware of the incident but had no immediate information to provide. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least three Syrian security personnel were also wounded, offering a differing account of the attacker’s identity.The US maintains hundreds of troops in eastern and central Syria as part of an international coalition fighting IS. Though the group was territorially defeated in 2019, the united nations estimates it still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters operating in Syria and Iraq through sleeper cells.US troops stationed at locations including al-Tanf have been targeted in the past. One of the deadliest such attacks occurred in 2019 in Manbij, when a bombing killed two US service members and two American civilians during a patrol.US President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed “very serious retaliation” after the attack in Syria.Taking to Truth Social, the US president said, ""We mourn the loss of three Great American Patriots in Syria, two soldiers, and one Civilian Interpreter. Likewise, we pray for the three injured soldiers who, it has just been confirmed, are doing well. This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them. The President of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is extremely angry and disturbed by this attack. There will be very serious retaliation.

As 20 states sued the Donald Trump administration for its $100k fee on H-1B visa, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, known for his strong anti-immigration stand, said these lawsuits will not hold water as President Donald Trump deserves all the credit to be the first president who took action against companies for using low-wage labors. Miller said President Trump has all the authority to decide who gets to enter the US and he blew off the lid of a whole model where tech companies fire Americans who train low-wage foreigners. Referring to the third-party companies that hire Indians for IT roles in the US as bodyshops, a known phrase in the industry, Miller said that these bodyshops are run by Americans in the middle of their career. They meet the CEOs of IT companies and then fire Americans after they train their low-wage replacements, Miller said, adding that the president has the right to decide who would enter the country and who won't.The Donald Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas so that companies do not hire foreigners in bulk and only high-skilled employees are hired. But President Trump asserted that he won't abolish the H-1B program as there are certain talents that need to be hired from foreign countries. “If hospitals and clinics must either pay an extra $100,000 per doctor to leave positions unfilled, the consequences are clear: fewer providers, longer wait times, reduced access to care and growing health disparities,” Bonta said.The visa fee triggered a major controversy and now 20 states have sued the administration claiming that the Trump administrations does not have the power or legal authorty to rewrite immigration law. “No president can ignore the co-equal branch of government of Congress, ignore the Constitution or ignore the law,” California attorney general Rob Bonta said.The lawsuit says the Department of Homeland Security skipped the required notice-and-comment procedures where a proposal is put out for the public to comment before it becomes a rule.","The Donald Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas so that companies do not hire foreigners in bulk and only high-skilled employees are hired.

Several US senators challenge a rule that ended automatic extension of work permits for spouses of H-1Bs and others,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/several-us-senators-challenge-a-rule-that-ended-automatic-extension-of-work-permits-for-spouses-of-h-1bs-and-others/articleshow/125945948.cms,"file photo

Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians





A group of Democratic-party senators including Alex Padilla, member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Sub-committee; Jacky Rosen and several others, have moved a resolution to reverse an ‘interim final rule’ recently issued by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This rule, which came into force from Oct 30, ended automatic renewals of work permits for certain categories of legally authorised non-citizens including spouses of H-1B visa holders.As reported earlier by TOI, it meant that nearly a lakh Indian spouses (largely women) who held employment authorisation documents (EADs) would no longer be able to continue to work after their current EAD expired. They would need to wait until the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved and renewed their EAD. The hitch: H-4 EAD holders can file renewal applications only up to 180 days before the expiration date, but USCIS typically takes a longer time to process the application. These senators point out that the interim final rule would impact nearly 87% of all pending renewals causing immense hardship.Prior to this amendment, an auto-extension of the EAD of up to 540 days was available. Thus, those who filed renewal applications on time could continue working while their applications were pending, a safeguard designed to prevent job losses caused by bureaucratic delays.With the safeguard withdrawn, many individuals face the prospect of losing their livelihoods simply because their renewals are stuck in processing queues that often stretch for months.This group of US senators have moved the resolution under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) – it enables a federal agency rule to be quickly overturned by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within a limited time after the rule is issued. Legal experts explain that generally a resolution under the CRA requires the President to sign off. But, Congress can attempt to override the President’s veto with a super-majority vote.By using the CRA, these senators are attempting a fast-track legislative reversal that would not only restore automatic extensions but also prevent the Trump administration from reintroducing a similar rule in the future without explicit Congressional approval.All hopes of those impacted are pinned on this resolution. “Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s campaign to marginalize noncitizens working here legally is disrupting our entire national economy and devastating employers who rely on their contributions,” said Senator Padilla. “The administration’s self-defeating rule to deny automatic work permit extensions would force people who have already been vetted to lose their ability to keep working, causing unnecessary strain for immigrants and employers alike. People who have already been screened and authorized to work should be able to keep working, plain and simple.” Several immigration attorneys told TOI that the DHS rule could also face court challenges, particularly as it was issued without a prior public consultation process.","A group of Democratic-party senators have moved a resolution to reverse an ‘interim final rule’ recently issued by the US Department of Homeland Security.

Republicans Revolt Rocks Trump; Showdown In Congress; Shock Vote To Overturn Federal Worker Ban

First Donald J Trump had his name planted over United States Institute of Peace after a not so peaceful takeover of the independent think tank established and funded by the US Congress Then the self styled ‘Peacemaker-in-Chief” wangled a dubious peace prize — dubbed ‘appease’ prize by critics— tailor made for him by FIFA and wore the medal himself before setting out to play host at the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors in Washington — the first president to do so in its 47-year history.Trump, a former host of the reality TV show The Apprentice, who seized control of John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in February, was “deeply involved” in choosing the five honorees, but refrained from picking himself though he did refer jokingly to a renamed “Trump-Kennedy Center.”Claiming his show was getting “rave reviews” even before it ended, Trump said, “This is the greatest evening in the history of the Kennedy Center – not even a contest.”“Now, I will say that I guarantee the fake news is going to give me horrible – ‘He was horrible as an emcee. Don’t ever let that happen again!’”Amid falling poll numbers over his handling of economy, Trump then traveled to Pennsylvania to tout his economic record — insisting that he's already the architect of ""lower prices"" and ""bigger paychecks,"" as a massive sign behind him proclaimed.Veering far off script and off the topic of affordability at times, he also blasted immigrants from ""shithole countries,"" denigrated windmills, mocked transgender people and called his predecessor, Joe Biden, a ""son of a b----.""Later in an interview with Politico, Trump gave himself an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus” grade on the economy. He defended trips abroad as fundamentally aimed at helping Americans back home by securing new investments.Sending shock waves across the Atlantic, he even denounced Europe as a “decaying” group of nations, calling them “weak” for failing to control migration and end the Russia-Ukraine war.“I think they don’t know what to do. Europe doesn’t know what to do,” he said offering, “I do explain to Europe because I think, you know, I’m supposed to be a very smart person, I can, I have eyes. I have ears. I have, er, knowledge. I have vast knowledge.”But ""I want to run the United States. I don't want to run Europe,"" he suggested before adding, ""I'm involved in Europe very much. NATO calls me daddy,"" alluding to Nato secretary general Mark Rutte’s remark about him.While suggesting a hands off approach, Trump also signaled that he would endorse European political candidates who supported his own vision for the continent.Describing cities like London and Paris as creaking under the burden of migration from the Middle East and Africa, Trump suggested without a change in border policy, some European states “will not be viable countries any longer.”The peace President then went on to warn that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s “days are numbered,” declining to rule out an American invasion of Venezuela to fight illegal narcotics trafficking into the US.Asked if he would consider similar action against Mexican or Colombian interests, Trump said, “Sure, I would.”Venezuela's Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado praised the US seizure of an oil tanker off her country's coast, saying it was necessary to choke the finances of the Maduro regime.The opposition leader, who had dedicated her peace prize to Trump revealed the U.S. helped her leave Venezuela after more than a year in hiding.Then out of the blue, the House Democrats released without context a second tranche of what they called “disturbing” photographs from the estate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, featuring among others Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, film director Woody Allen and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.With the images revealing nothing new about Epstein’s ties to prominent men, the White House was quick to accuse Democrats of selectively “cherry-picking” the photographs for political purposes and “to try and create a false narrative” with a White House spokesperson saying, “The Democrat hoax against President Trump has been repeatedly debunked.”After so much hard work, miffed over suggestions that “I am “slowing up,” am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health,” Trump proclaimed on Truth social, “There has never been a President that has worked as hard as me! My hours are the longest, and my results are among the best.”Having “ACED” physical, mental and cognitive tests with “PERFECT Marks — Some have even said they have never seen such Strong Results,” Trump suggested “it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean “THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.”Back to the pastime of media bashing, the White House released its second list of ‘Media Offenders of the Week’ with a video of Santa Claus revealing the naughty list.“The Fake News just earned a spot on the naughty list. No gifts. Just receipts,” it said naming journalists from half a dozen outlets including MS Now, New York Post, CNN, CBS News and Axios.Late Night host Jimmy Kimmel, however, escaped for now mention in the naughty list for taking a swipe at Trump's 'Gold Card' offering “A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent.”Kimmel had a different take in rethinking the Statue of Liberty's inscription: ""Never mind your poor and tired. Give us a million bucks - you're in.""Trump capped the week with a series of images depicting his great achievements with one portraying him as “PEACEMAKER-IN-CHIEF.”His followers were quick to respond with memes with one showing him as Superman — indeed with big eyes, big ears and a big head!(By arrangement with The American Bazaar, www.americanbazaaronline.com .)First Donald J.
