""I will say, and you will say- Jai Shri Ram,"" Ravi said. His call was followed by the chants from the audience.Congress MLA JMH Hassan Maulaana strongly condemned the governor's comments, calling them deeply objectionable and accusing him of echoing the rhetoric of the RSS and BJP. He added that such statements were inappropriate and unworthy of the constitutional position held by Ravi.""The Governor is occupying one of the highest posts in the country but he is speaking like a religious leader... He has become a propaganda master of the RSS and the BJP.

The position he holds is a constitutional post, so he has to remain neutral,"" he added.The Congress leader also pointed out that governor Ravi had previously faced sharp criticism from the Supreme Court, which, he noted, had delivered a landmark ruling against the governor for acting in an unconstitutional, unlawful, and improper way by failing to act on ten bills passed by the state legislature.In a landmark ruling on Saturday, the Supreme Court approved ten state bills that had been held up without the governor’s assent. Governor Ravi had withheld the bills, reserving them for the President's consideration. The Court went a step further by setting clear timelines—giving the Governor one month and the President three months to take action on such bills.","Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi has sparked another controversy after he asked students to chant ""Jai Shri Ram"" during an event in Madurai.

Public outcry and police appeal

Investigation underway

NEW DELHI: The main accused wanted in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old girl in Karnataka's Hubballi, was killed in an encounter on Sunday while allegedly attempting to flee from the cops.Earlier in the day, a body of a girl was discovered in a tin-roofed abandoned shed, sparking outrage. Hundreds gathered outside the Ashok Nagar police station demanding justice for the child.A massive manhunt was launched and the accused was identified as 35-year-old Ritesh Kumar from Bihar's Patna.Later in the day, based on CCTV footage and inputs from local residents, police traced the accused.“This morning in Vijayanagara area, within Ashok Nagar limits, the girl’s body was found in an abandoned shed. We identified the accused as Ritesh Kumar. He tried to flee, damaged the police vehicle, assaulted our officers, and pelted stones,” said Commissioner Kumar.“In self-defence, PSI Annapurna fired warning shots and then shot at the accused, injuring him in the leg and chest,” he added. The man was later declared dead.Defending police action, Karnataka government chief whip Saleem Ahmed said, “The commissioner has given me the information that the accused tried to hit the lady inspector and in self-defence, she had to fire at him... It is not a failure of law and order. Our police are competent enough to take action, so have they…”According to Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner N Shashi Kumar, the girl’s mother had taken her along while working in nearby homes in the locality. An unidentified man took the girl away from one of these houses. After a frantic search, she was found unconscious in a bathroom inside a tin-roofed abandoned shed located directly opposite the house where she was last seen.“She was immediately shifted to the hospital where she was declared brought dead,” the Commissioner said.The victim’s family hails from Koppal district. Her mother works as a domestic help and beauty parlour assistant, while the father is a painter, officials said.While reports of sexual assault have emerged, the police have not confirmed it. “No information for now. Cause of death and whether there was any kind of assault will all be verified after medical examination,” Kumar said.Following the gruesome incident, angry residents gathered in large numbers at the Ashok Nagar police station demanding swift justice and answers. Police appealed to the public to maintain calm and let the investigation proceed.“The complaint is being taken from the girl’s parents. Necessary legal action is underway,” Kumar said.Authorities are still verifying key details. A post-mortem is expected to shed light on the cause of death and whether there was any sexual assault involved.The identity and background of the accused are also being investigated. “Once the identity is fully established, we’ll ascertain his whereabouts and any past records,” Kumar said.","The main accused wanted in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old girl in Karnataka's Hubballi, was killed in an encounter on Sunday while allegedly attempting to flee from the cops.

'A truly pathetic state of affairs'

Home secretary assures all assistance

NEW DELHI: Amid unrest in West Bengal's Murshidabad , 12 more people were arrested in connection with violence, taking the total number to over 150. No new incident of violence has been reported yet after five companies of BSF were deployed in the Muslim-dominated district. Meanwhile, BJP claimed that over 400 Hindus have been ""forced to flee"" their houses following the tension.The move came after Calcutta high court on Saturday ordered the ""immediate"" deployment of Central forces in the area. IG South Bengal Frontier Karni Singh Shekhawat, said that BSF would coordinate with state police to restore peace in the region. He added that more forces would be added if needed.""We have to work along with them in this situation. The discussions were held on this only. We have sent our five companies to help the police. We are here to help the police, not for independent action. We will act according to the demands of the state police. We hope that peace will be restored here soon. If the police need more companies, we will provide them. BSF is ready for all situations,"" he said.The violence in West Bengal's Muslim-dominated Murshidabad erupted in the wake of the amended Waqf law. At least 3 people were killed and over 150 were arrested in connection with the violence. Meanwhile, raids were conducted at several places in West Bengal.Earlier on Friday, several vehicles were set ablaze and stones were hurled at security forces. Various districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 parganas were rocked by violence.BJP leader and West Bengal Assembly's Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari claimed that over 400 people have been ""forced to flee"" their houses following the violence.Further attacking Bengal's government, he said that ""appeasement politics"" on TMC has ""emboldened radical elements.""""More than 400 Hindus from Dhulian, Murshidabad driven by fear of religiously driven bigots were forced to flee across the river & take shelter at Par Lalpur High School, Deonapur-Sovapur GP, Baisnabnagar, Malda,"" Adhikari wrote in a post on X.The BJP leader also shared pictures and videos from the area, including interviews from displaced individuals. One man claimed his house had been set on fire while alleging that police personnel present at the scene failed to act and instead fled.""I urge the Central Paramilitary Forces deployed in the District, the State Police and the district administration to ensure the safe return of these displaced Hindus & protect their lives from this jihadist terror. Bengal is burning. The social fabric is torn. Enough is enough,"" his post read.""Religious persecution in Bengal is real. Appeasement politics of TMC has emboldened radical elements. Hindus are being hunted, our people are running for their lives in their own land! Shame on the State Govt for allowing this breakdown of law & order,"" he added.Adding to the rising dissent, Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday announced a public protest meeting against the Act.“A protest public meeting is being organized by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board against the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 on 19th April from 7 pm to 10 pm in Hyderabad Darussalam. It will be presided over by the President of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Khalid Saifullah Rahmani,” Owaisi said at a press conference.Owaisi said members from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh’s Muslim Personal Law Boards and key Muslim organizations would participate.“They will tell the public through their speeches that this Waqf (Amendment) Act is not in favour of the Waqf... We are also trying to talk to the members of the Waqf Committee, and if their schedule permits, they can also come and participate.”A senior police officer said on Sunday that prohibitory orders under section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) have been imposed in affected areas.He added that internet services were also suspended and security forces are checking vehicles on the main roads and patrolling the sensitive pockets.Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Saugata Roy said that chief minster Mamata Banerjee has called a meeting to pacify the Muslim community.Saugata Roy said, ""Mamata Banerjee is the leader of the people of Bengal. She knows how to run Bengal. There is no place for BJP here. People are unhappy over Waqf Amendment Bill, so the Chief Minister has called a meeting to pacify the Muslim community. People's sentiments are agitated over the Waqf Bill. The reaction was spontaneous.""BJP Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal, Jyotirmay Singh Mahato on Sunday wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah requesting him to declare select border districts of West Bengal as 'disturbed areas' under AFSPA.Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind chief Mahmood Madani launched a scathing attack on the legislation, calling it a “politically motivated” move to enable land grabbing in the name of reform.Addressing a press conference in the national capital on Sunday, Madani alleged that the Act was not intended to strengthen the Waqf Boards, but to serve “vested interests.”“This is not an issue of Waqf but politics. In the name of Muslims, sometimes by abusing Muslims or by being the sympathisers of Muslims, this act (was implemented) with malicious intent,” Madani said.Madani claimed the government and its allies had created a false narrative to justify the amendment, portraying the previous Waqf Boards as operating without accountability.“BJP and its friends in the country and media friends told that the earlier Waqf Board was such that it could do anything... People of their choice were made in the government,” he said.He went on to accuse the government of facilitating real estate developers and land occupiers, particularly those eyeing prime properties.“You are trying to help the builders and land occupiers, so that they get the lands in prime locations... This act or amendment is not right for the country, society or Muslims. You are benefiting the occupiers,” Madani said.Amid tension, political storm erupted after BJP lashed out at state's chief minister Mamata Banerjee, saying that her government is ""incapable"" of handling the situation.""Let it be known that this was not an act of protest, rather a premeditated act of violence, an assault on Democracy and Governance by Jihadist forces who seek to spread chaos in order to assert their dominance and sow fear amongst other Communities of our Society,"" BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari said in a post on X.""Public property was destroyed, Government Officials felt threatened, and an atmosphere of fear and intimidation was created, all under the false guise of dissent. The silence of the Mamata Banerjee Government is deafening,"" he added.'A truly pathetic state of affairs'West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar alleged that Mamata has handed over the state to ""Jihadis"" for vote bank politics.""The situation is very terrible. The special bench of the High Court has given the verdict, and we welcome it. The situation has become like this because of Mamata Banerjee's incompetence. The verdict of the High Court today is a big slap on Mamata Banerjee's cheek that she is not ready to rule the state. She is not eligible to rule the state,"" he said while speaking to ANI.On Sunday, BJP's Amit Malviya targetted Banerjee, saying that the morale of the West Bengal police has hit a new low, with senior officials struggling to maintain order amid a series of violent incidents and growing political pressure. In a post on X, Malviya claimed that during the recent violence in Murshidabad, West Bengal police officers refused to enter the riot-hit areas until the BSF arrived. He further alleged that the director general of police had to be physically present to coax officers into action.""The morale of the West Bengal Police is at an all-time low, following Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s repeated capitulation to rampaging Islamist mobs. In fact, they even refused to enter the riot-affected areas of Murshidabad until the BSF arrived. The Director General of Police had to be physically present to coax his own force into action. A similar situation occurred during the Sandeshkhali unrest, where the state’s top cop had to intervene personally—though the reasons were different then,"" Malviya said.""During the RG Kar protests, it was police officers who held press conferences and planted stories to shape the narrative. Every time Mamata Banerjee finds herself cornered, she uses the police as a political shield, as if no other TMC leader is willing—or perhaps even allowed—to defend her. The rest appear to be nothing more than clerks in Mamata Banerjee’s criminal empire,"" he added.Union home secretary Govind Mohan on Saturday assured all possible help amid violence in a video conference with the chief secretary and the director general of police of the state.Mohan asked the high officials to keep a close watch on other sensitive districts also and take adequate steps.He mentioned that the ""Centre is also closely monitoring the situation and assured the state all possible assistance including deployment of additional manpower, if necessary.""",The violence in West Bengal's Muslim-dominated Murshidabad erupted in the wake of the amended Waqf law.

OP Jindal University: Girl smuggled into university hostel in suitcase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/girl-smuggled-into-university-hostel-in-suitcase/articleshow/120245456.cms,"Poll Do you think the university's disciplinary action is justified? No, it was just a harmless prank. Yes, it was a serious breach of rules.

GURGAON: A video from OP Jindal University in Sonipat - featuring a girl emerging out of a suitcase like a magician's escape - went viral on social media, with many describing it as a boy's 'Romeo-and-Juliet' style attempt to smuggle his love into his hostel. The university said it was prank gone too far and was taking action against the students.Although the video - which surfaced Saturday - does not show any boy in it, sources at the university said one had indeed sneaked into the girls' hostel.It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the suitcase incident.According to Anjoo Mohun, director of communications at the university, the video shows a group of girl students moving their friend around the hostel in a large suitcase as part of a ""light-hearted"" joke.""This was a prank, entirely confined to the premises of the girls' hostel. The suitcase was carried into a public area within the hostel, where security personnel monitoring CCTV footage noticed suspicious activity and intervened. When they opened the suitcase, they found a girl inside,"" she said.With the video spreading far and wide - and attracting a volley of reactions - the university promised disciplinary action against every student involved in the 'prank'. On Saturday evening, the students had received show-cause notices, asking them to appear before a disciplinary committee by the end of this month.The university emphasised that student safety remained a top priority. ""We're treating the matter seriously. While no one was harmed, such actions can raise security concerns and have unintended consequences,"" it said in a statement.The university also urged people to refrain from sharing ""unverified information"" and respect the ""privacy and dignity"" of the students involved.But through the day, the video drew a mix of reactions on social media.Many were quick to criticise the strict restrictions that compel couples to resort to such extreme measures. ""The length that people need to go to just to get some private time with their loved ones in this country is so dehumanising,"" one user wrote.Others took a lighter approach. ""On the bright side, he carried her alive,"" one posted. Some could not resist poking fun at the risks involved. ""Itna bada risk kaun leta hai?"" one remarked, questioning why the couple did not opt for an affordable hotel instead.",A video from OP Jindal University in Sonipat went viral on social media.

'A horrible thing'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday urged US President Donald Trump to visit his war-torn country before making any decisions on ending the conflict with Russia.In a televised interview, Zelenskyy said Trump needed to see firsthand the destruction left behind by Moscow's invasion.“Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,” Zelenskyy said during a CBS '60 Minutes' interview.He said that a visit to Ukraine would help Trump understand the nature of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “You will understand with whom you have a deal,” he added.Zelenskyy made clear that Trump would be free to visit any part of the country that has seen destruction. “If Trump chose to visit Ukraine, we will not prepare anything. It will not be theater,” he said. “You can go exactly where you want, in any city which (has) been under attacks.”Zelenskyy claimed that Putin never wants to ""end the war.""“Putin can’t be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn't working – this is why,” Zelenskyy said. “Putin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent. Putin wants to destroy us completely — our sovereignty and our people.”On the question of peace, Zelenskyy said a just resolution would be one that preserves Ukraine’s independence. “To not lose our sovereignty or our independence,” he said, vowing that Ukraine would reclaim its occupied territory. “We, no matter what, will take back what is ours because we never lost it — the Russians took it from us.”The comments come weeks after a tense exchange at the White House in February between Zelenskyy, Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Vance had accused Ukraine of organising “propaganda tours” for visiting foreign leaders — a charge Zelenskyy dismissed again in the interview.Trump has been pushing for a swift resolution to the more than three-year-old war, with the US reportedly holding direct talks with both Russia and Ukraine. While Kyiv has accepted a US-backed proposal for an unconditional ceasefire, Moscow has rejected it so far.After a Russian strike on Sunday in Ukraine's Sumy that killed at least 34 people, Trump called it “a horrible thing.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.”The White House has not blamed Moscow for the strike. However, US secretary of state Marco Rubio offered his condolences “to the victims of today’s horrifying Russian missile attack on Sumy.”The missile strike on Sumy occurred just two days after Trump’s presidential envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, aiming to advance US-led efforts toward a possible truce.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged US President Donald Trump to visit his war-torn country before making any decisions on ending the conflict.

She plays competitive golf with Charlie Woods, son of Tiger Woods, and is committed to play collegiate golf at the University of Miami. She became a more public figure during the Republican National Convention in 2024, when she delivered a speech offering a personal glimpse into life with her famous grandfather, describing him as a “normal grandpa.”Adding to that evening’s spectacle, Trump’s VIP section at the Kaseya Center where the fight was held featured a high-profile gathering of political and tech leaders.

In a lengthy Truth Social post, Trump claimed the show was guilty of “fraud” in connection with the 2024 presidential election and said CBS should face severe penalties, including losing its broadcasting license .“Almost every week, 60 Minutes, which is being sued for Billions of Dollars for the fraud they committed in the 2024 Presidential Election with their Interview of Failed Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris , mentions the name ‘TRUMP’ in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend’s ‘BROADCAST’ tops them all,” Trump wrote.The president alleged that two recent 60 Minutes segments misrepresented him—one involving the war in Ukraine and another about Greenland. “They did not one, but TWO, major stories on ‘TRUMP,’ one having to do with Ukraine, which I say is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED… the other story was having to do with Greenland, casting our Country, as led by me, falsely, inaccurately, and fraudulently,” he said.Trump further claimed that CBS and its parent company Paramount tried “everything possible to illegally elect Kamala,” referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. He added, “They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing. They should lose their license!”Calling on regulatory action, Trump wrote, “Hopefully, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ), as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”CBS and 60 Minutes have not yet responded to Trump’s claims. His post comes amid an ongoing legal battle in which Trump says he is suing the network over the Harris interview and its election coverage.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at CBS’s 60 Minutes on Sunday, accusing the long-running news programme of defamation and dishonest reporting.

He also stated that China is ""actively building a diversified market, deepening cooperation with all parties in the supply chain,"" and added, ""Importantly, China's domestic demand market is broad.""These remarks come a day after US President Donald Trump said no country would be exempt from tariffs. ""Nobody is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China, which, by far, treats us the worst!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform.Trump’s administration has been engaged in a trade conflict with China, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other’s goods. US tariffs on Chinese imports have reached 145 per cent, while China has responded with a 125 per cent tariff band on American products.On Friday, the US appeared to ease some pressure by announcing temporary tariff exemptions for products such as smartphones, laptops, and semiconductors, many of which are sourced from China. These exemptions are expected to benefit US tech firms like Nvidia, Dell, and Apple, which manufacture several of their products in China.However, President Trump and his aides clarified that these exemptions are not permanent. Trump said on Sunday that the move was being misunderstood and that his administration is working on new tariffs that could apply to items recently exempted. ""The tariffs will be in place in the not distant future,"" he said.Earlier, China’s commerce ministry responded to the exemptions by saying that the move only ""represents a small step"" and urged the US to ""completely cancel"" its entire tariff policy.Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a visit to Vietnam at the start of his Southeast Asia tour on Monday, cautioned that protectionist policies ""will lead nowhere.""In an article published in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi called on both countries to ""resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.""He also repeated China's stance that a ""trade war and tariff war will produce no winner.""","China's customs department said on Monday that while the country is under ""severe"" pressure in its export sector, the situation is not disastrous.

No injuries were reported.Governor Shapiro, a prominent Democrat who was considered a potential vice-presidential pick in 2024, credited a state trooper with alerting his sleeping family and ensuring their safe evacuation. “Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished,” he said in a statement.Speaking later outside the residence, with a charred and broken window behind him, Shapiro condemned the rise in political violence . “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other... it is not okay, and it has to stop,” he said.Authorities said Balmer scaled a fence to enter the property, carrying “homemade incendiary devices.” He reportedly spent several minutes evading law enforcement before setting the blaze.District attorney Fran Chardo confirmed Balmer is in custody and said a criminal complaint is being prepared. The charges will also include aggravated assault against an “enumerated person” — a legal term often referring to public officials or law enforcement officers.Shapiro, 51, was elected governor in 2022 after defeating a far-right candidate backed by former President Donald Trump.","Cody Balmer, 38, arrested on charges including attempted murder, terrorism, and aggravated arson.

The Trump administration confirmed on Saturday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador but did not provide the full scope of information demanded by a federal judge regarding efforts to bring him back.In a court filing submitted, US state department official Michael G Kozak said that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador, reported news agency Associated Press.“He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador,” wrote Kozak, identified in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.However, Kozak’s statement failed to address US district judge Paula Xinis’s additional directives. On Friday, the judge had ordered the administration to disclose not only Abrego Garcia’s “current physical location and custodial status” but also “what steps, if any, defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.Xinis had expressed deep frustration over the government’s lack of transparency. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here,” she said during a tense court hearing on Friday, adding, “The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”As per AP, Friday’s hearing exposed the administration’s failure to provide even basic information about Garcia's whereabouts or the plan for his return, prompting Xinis to demand daily updates from a US official with direct knowledge of the case.Garcia, 29, was deported in March despite a 2019 federal court ruling that prohibited his removal due to the likelihood he would face persecution in El Salvador. The deportation, which was later admitted by a US immigration official to be an “administrative error,” sent him to El Salvador’s CECOT prison , a high-security facility known for holding dangerous criminals.Garcia’s deportation occurred under a $6 million agreement between the Trump administration and the Salvadoran government. The deal allowed US authorities to detain and transfer migrants to Salvadoran custody.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.

A 5.5 magnitude earthquake rattled central Myanmar early Sunday, making frightened residents rush out of their homes in towns near the epicentre. This new quake in the Southeast Asian nation hit just weeks after a powerful 7.7-magnitude temblor on March 28, as one of its strongest aftershocks .The quake struck near Meiktila , a small city in Mandalay Region , according to the US geological survey . Its epicentre lay roughly between Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, and the capital Naypyitaw—both of which were heavily affected by the quake of March 28.Two residents of Wundwin township, near the epicentre, told The Associated Press by phone that Sunday’s quake was strong enough to shake buildings and damage ceilings. “People rushed out of buildings,” one said. Another resident described cracked walls and minor debris falling indoors.However, in Naypyitaw, a resident told AP that he did not feel tremor.All three people spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of angering the military authorities, who have long maintained tight control over information and restrict public criticism—especially during times of crisis.Sunday’s tremor is one of the strongest aftershocks following the March 28 disaster, which killed at least 3,649 people and injured more than 5,000, according to the military government. That quake also flattened villages, severely damaged hospitals, and disrupted farming and transport across several regions.The UN last week warned that the devastation is compounding Myanmar’s existing humanitarian crisis, worsened by ongoing conflict and the displacement of over 3 million people.The earthquake struck as the country marked the beginning of Thingyan, Myanmar’s traditional New Year holiday. Celebrations had already been canceled out of respect for the recent victims.While officials said there were no immediate reports of new casualties.","The quake struck near Meiktila, a small city in Mandalay Region.

Rubble littered a street as rescuers carried one person away from the site, which the rebels claimed was a ceramics factory in the Bani Matar neighborhood of Sanaa, the capital.The US military's Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15.The American military also hasn't been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far.Houthis claim another American drone shot down The Houthis separately claimed Sunday night they shot down an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen's Hajjah governorate, which sits to the northwest of the country on the Red Sea on the country's border with Saudi Arabia.Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, described the downing in a prerecorded video message as the fourth in two weeks by the rebels. Saree said the rebels targeted the drone with ""a locally manufactured missile."" The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles - such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 - capable of downing aircraft.Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the US military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen.Central Command said it was aware of ""reports"" of the drone being shot down, but did not elaborate.US strikes come as part of monthlong intense campaign An AP review has found the new US operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting ""Israeli"" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.The US campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.","Suspected US airstrikes around Yemen's rebel-held capital killed at least six people.

Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa , a towering figure in Latin American literature and winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, died on Sunday at the age of 89. His death was confirmed in a statement shared on social media by his son Álvaro Vargas Llosa.“It is with deep sorrow that we announce that our father, Mario Vargas Llosa , passed away peacefully in Lima today, surrounded by his family,” read the statement signed by his children Álvaro, Gonzalo and Morgana.The family said there would be no public ceremony and that his remains would be cremated. “His departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,” the statement added.Vargas Llosa was known for novels such as The Time of the Hero, Conversation in the Cathedral, and Feast of the Goat, works that explored power, corruption, and the contradictions of Peruvian society. His debut novel, The Time of the Hero (1963), based on his experience at a military academy, provoked national controversy and was partly burned by military officers who labelled him a communist.He was a leading voice of the Latin American literary “Boom” alongside Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes, gaining global recognition for his ability to intertwine personal stories with sweeping political commentary.Born Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa on March 28, 1936, in Arequipa, Peru, he spent his early childhood in Bolivia with his mother and grandmother. He later discovered that his father—previously believed to be dead—was alive, and the family reunited in Lima when Vargas Llosa was ten.He was sent to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, an experience he described as “like discovering hell,” which later served as the basis for his first novel. He studied literature and law at San Marcos University in Lima and later earned a doctorate in Madrid.His career spanned decades and continents, with residences in Paris, New York, and Madrid. He was also a political commentator and columnist, penning the influential “Piedra de Toque” column, and evolved from youthful communist affiliations to becoming a staunch critic of authoritarianism and leftist regimes in Latin America.In 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for president of Peru but lost to Alberto Fujimori, a political outsider who later became a controversial authoritarian leader. Though he never held office, his political views influenced much of his later work and public life.His novels often depicted Peru's complex social fabric, from Amazonian tribes to crumbling aristocracies. Later works, such as The Way to Paradise and The Dream of the Celt, explored historical figures like Paul Gauguin and Roger Casement .Vargas Llosa was twice married and had three children. His high-profile relationship with Spanish socialite Isabel Preysler, mother of singer Enrique Iglesias, ended in 2022.His final novel, Harsh Times (2019), tackled US intervention in Guatemala. Despite critics’ disapproval of his political shift, Vargas Llosa remained a literary force into his late 80s, his works continuing to provoke thought and admiration across the world.","Mario Vargas Llosa, winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, died on Sunday at the age of 89.

‘Tariffs don’t bring manufacturing back. They’re just a tax on Americans’: China targets US public amid escalating trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tariffs-dont-bring-manufacturing-back-theyre-just-a-tax-on-americans-china-targets-us-public-amid-escalating-trade-war/articleshow/120266278.cms,"As tensions deepen in the US-China trade war , Beijing appears to be shifting tactics by addressing the American public directly, instead of engaging solely with the Trump administration. In its latest effort, China has launched a social media campaign to counter the prevailing belief among many Americans that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump primarily hurt foreign economies.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) featuring a man portrayed as a US importer. The video targets American citizens, particularly Trump supporters, with a warning that tariffs on Chinese imports ultimately burden US consumers. “Foreign countries pay the tariffs? No – US businesses pay, then pass costs to you. Tariffs don’t bring manufacturing back. They’re just a tax on Americans,” Mao wrote in the caption.The message was timed alongside renewed hostilities in the ongoing trade dispute. On Wednesday, Trump announced an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting a retaliatory move from Beijing, which raised its own tariffs on American imports to 125% by Friday. The tit-for-tat measures have pushed bilateral trade—valued at over $650 billion in 2024—toward a potential breakdown, analysts warn.While Trump insists the tariffs are paid by foreign exporters—telling reporters on Air Force One, “We can set the tariff, and they can choose not to deal with us or they can choose to pay it”—economists and trade experts point out that the importers, not foreign suppliers, shoulder the cost. These costs are usually passed on to consumers through higher prices.Still, Trump has left the door open for negotiations. “The president made it very clear: When the United States is punched, he will punch back harder,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday, even as Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggesting a deal might be possible.Meanwhile, in a separate move, the Trump administration announced exemptions for certain electronics from the punitive tariffs, providing relief for major tech companies like Apple and Dell. The US Customs and Border Protection agency issued a notice listing 20 product categories—including computers, semiconductors, memory chips and displays—that will be excluded retroactively from April 5.The exemption also applies to Trump’s 10% “baseline” tariffs on imports from most countries, excluding China, effectively lowering costs on key tech components from Taiwan and India.","Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) featuring a man portrayed as a US importer.

A New Jersey restaurateur , previously convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, is now in the custody of US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), facing likely deportation.Ming Xi Zhang , a 61-year-old Chinese national and owner of Ya Ya Noodles in Montgomery Township , was arrested on March 24 in Newark, New Jersey, reported the New York Post.Zhang, widely known in his community as “Sushi John,” pleaded guilty in May 2021 to operating as an agent of China in 2016 without informing the US attorney general, a direct violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act .According to ICE, Zhang lawfully entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport in June 2000 but later “violated the terms of his lawful admission.”As per FAIRUS.org, Zhang admitted to meeting with Chinese security operatives in the Bahamas in 2016 and later delivering $35,000 to a person in New Jersey. He also hosted a Chinese government agent twice at his Princeton-area home. His activities remain partly shrouded in secrecy as court records are sealed.On April 30, 2024, Zhang was sentenced by a federal judge to three years of probation and fined $10,000. His release on a $150,000 bond following the 2021 plea came with the condition that he could be removed from the US.“Any illegal alien conducting activities related to espionage, sabotage or export control against the United States is subject to deportation,” said ICE Newark field office Director John Tsoukaris.He is now being held at the Elizabeth Detention Center as he awaits immigration proceedings. Despite the serious charges, Zhang’s restaurant has remained open and local support appears strong. “The whole town has been really supportive,” a staff member was quoted saying by The New York Post. “Everyone’s been coming in, offering phone numbers, talking to his family”, the member added.Zhang’s case comes amid a broader Trump administration effort to tighten immigration enforcement and remove individuals deemed national security threats. Similar recent arrests have raised concerns about a growing pattern of Chinese nationals attempting to access sensitive US sites, including military bases, according to FAIRUS.org.The department of homeland security had recently warned that Chinese-made internet-connected devices, such as surveillance cameras, could be exploited to spy on or disrupt US infrastructure.","Ming Xi Zhang, a 61-year-old Chinese national, was arrested on March 24 in Newark, New Jersey.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) for the next four years after the party's intra-party elections held at the Central Secretariat in Islamabad, The Express Tribune reported.The elections were conducted according to the PPP's constitution and finalised key leadership positions for the next four years.

The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water."" Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, ""Be it Musharraf's unilateral canal proposal, or that of the PTI founder, there is no forum where we have not taken up our struggle."" He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab. These are reservations we have had for a very long time."" He stated that he was the first to raise his voice against the canal project.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

"Shutter-down strike, road blockades grip Balochistan as Akhtar Mengal leads protest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shutter-down-strike-road-blockades-grip-balochistan-as-akhtar-mengal-leads-protest/articleshow/120080322.cms,"Pakistan's flag

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.
