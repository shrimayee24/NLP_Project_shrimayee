, cops say have to arrest man

AHMEDABAD: Happily-ever-after stories are all about leaving the trials and tribulations behind. So, imagine the incredulity on the face of a 48-year-old grandfather of two when police landed at his doorstep around a week ago to arrest him for “kidnapping” his wife of 27 years — the one he loved, eloped with, and built a home with four daughters.Turns out his wife’s parents had filed a case against him after their daughter fled with the man she wanted to spend her life with against her family’s wishes.That was in Aug 1997. The charge of kidnapping under sections 363 and 364 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code remained against the then 21-year-old native of Rajasthan's Ajmer, unbeknownst to the couple revelling in newly-wedded bliss in a village of Gujarat.Mehsana Police recently received information that a man resembling a fugitive “kidnapper” against whom a case had been filed almost three decades ago was now living in that area and making a living as an autorickshaw operator.Narendrasinh Sodha from the Mehsana police said a cops landed at the man’s doorstep, only to find the woman he is supposed to have kidnapped living with him as his wife.“We had no option but to arrest the man, although his wife said they had been happily married. She paraded their four daughters and two grandchildren as proof and said that there was no longer any animosity with her family,” Sodha said.The woman’s father died some years ago, while her brother doesn’t even remember that a case had been filed. Days after the Oct 2 arrest, a court freed the autorickshaw driver on bail. An officer blamed the confusion on the family’s failure to inform police about their “reconciliation over the years”.",A 48-year-old grandfather of two was arrested for 'kidnapping' his wife of 27 years.

The Padma Vibhushan recipient, who led the Tata Group for over two decades, had been in intensive care since Monday.But this is the story of the dark time when this national icon stood tall during devastating 26/11 terror attack.In November 2008, Mumbai witnessed a devastating terrorist attack orchestrated by the Pakistani group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Ten terrorists infiltrated the city via the sea and targeted several prime locations, including the iconic Taj Hotel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. The attack claimed 166 lives, including 33 at the Taj Hotel, and injured more than 300 people.During the attack, Ratan Tata, then 70 years old, displayed remarkable courage and leadership. He was seen standing at the Colaba end of the Taj Hotel as security forces carried out operations against the terrorists inside. In the aftermath, Tata pledged to reopen the hotel and support the families of those killed or injured in the attack.Speaking to National Geographic later, Tata recalled, ""Somebody called me and said there had been shooting at the Taj. I called up the exchange Taj and there was no reply, which was very strange. So I got in my car and came here, and the watchman stopped me from going into the lobby because there was shooting. You know, at a time like that, we had about 300 guests in the hotel. There were. Restaurants were full, the people in the various restaurants who were removed and brought to the chambers. So the staff was terrific. Without a master plan of evacuation, they moved people to safer places. But many of them got killed in the process.""""Throughout this period, he stood by the charge and stood by the management of the Taj right here outside on the pavement,"" a staff member recalled.Later in 2020, while recalling the incident, Tata wrote in an Instagram post: ""The wanton destruction that took place 12 years ago today will never be forgotten. But what is more memorable, is the way Mumbai as a diverse people came together, casting aside all differences, to vanquish the terrorism and destruction on that day. Today, we certainly can mourn the ones we lost and honour the sacrifice of the brave who helped conquer the enemy, but what we must applaud, is the unity and the acts of kindness and sensitivity which we should cherish, and which hopefully, will continue to shine in the years ahead,""The Tata Group formed The Taj Public Service Welfare Trust (TPSWT) to provide humanitarian support during disasters, and Ratan Tata personally visited the homes of victims to ensure their well-being. According to the BBC, he paid the relatives of those killed the salaries they would have earned for the rest of their lives, demonstrating his compassion and commitment to the affected families.","Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata passed away at the age of 86 in Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital.

Tuning In

WASHINGTON: Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has erased Republican rival Donald Trump 's advantage in the vast middle of American society: suburban residents and middle-income households, an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.Since President Joe Biden ended his flagging reelection bid on July 21, Vice President Harris has pulled into the lead in both of these large demographic groups, reinvigorating Democrats' prospects in the Nov 5 election, though the race remains exceptionally close.Suburbanites, who make up about half of the US electorate and are as racially diverse as the nation at large, are a key prize. Biden beat Trump in suburban counties by about six percentage points in the 2020 presidential election.Before Biden dropped out, Trump was leading 43 per cent to 40 per cent among suburbanites in Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in June and July, reflecting the Democrat's struggle to energize supporters.Harris began closing the gap when she launched her campaign in July and led Trump 47 per cent to 41 per cent among suburban voters in polling across September and October. That represents a nine-point swing in the Democrat's favor, according to the analysis of six Reuters/Ipsos polls that included responses from over 6,000 registered voters.During the same periods, Trump went from leading Biden 44 per cent to 37 per cent among voters in households that earn between $50,000 and $100,000 - roughly the middle third of the nation - to trail Harris 43 per cent to 45 per cent, also a nine-point swing away from Trump. The figures had margins of error of around 3 percentage points.Trump carried this group 52 per cent-47 per cent in 2020, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls.Reuters/Ipsos surveys have shown voters consider the economy the No. 1 issue ahead of the election and in a poll conducted in October, 46 per cent of voters said Trump was the better candidate for the economy, 8 points more than Harris' 38 per cent.The polls have also shown Trump as the more trusted candidate on immigration and crime. Trump told supporters in August he was the candidate that would keep suburbs safe and ensure that migrants coming across the border illegally are kept ""away from the suburbs.""Trump has blamed the Biden administration for inflation that has hurt middle class Americans. Harris, meanwhile, has put considerable focus in her speeches on pledges to increase the size of the middle class. She also is more often picked in polls as the better candidate for protecting democracy and taking a stand against political extremism.""Her focus on affordability has been highly effective in narrowing Trump's advantage on inflation and the economy,"" said David Wasserman , a political analyst at the Cook Political Report .Wasserman said Harris appeared to be performing well among relatively affluent suburbanites who could be growing more optimistic about the economy, while her gains among middle-income voters could be due to her campaign's regular pledges to help middle-class households.But he noted that voter turnout in Democratic-leaning urban areas and Republican-leaning rural towns could also be critical in deciding the election.Harris supporters contacted by Reuters for follow-up interviews this week also said they had not paid much attention to her before she became a presidential candidate, and that they became more supportive of her as they learned more about her.The latest of the six polls, conducted Oct 4-7, showed Harris up a marginal 3 percentage points over Trump among registered voters overall, 46 per cent to 43 per cent.Her modest edge in national polling is significant although the winner of the election will likely be determined by the results in seven battleground states - Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia - where polls have also shown a tight race.Winning the middle - whether nationally or in the election's key states - won't necessarily crown the victor. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who got nearly 3 million votes more than Trump nationwide in the 2016 election and beat him in suburban counties by about 1 percentage point, still lost the election when Trump flipped six states that had voted Democratic in 2012.Poll respondent Sheila Lester , an 83-year-old Harris supporter living in Peoria, Arizona, which mostly lies in the state's battleground Maricopa County, said in a phone interview that she had become convinced Trump would beat Biden.She said she rejoiced when the Democratic Party quickly coalesced around the candidacy of Harris, especially since she could be the first woman U.S. president.""The response that she has gotten has made me a little bit more proud of this country,"" said Lester , a retired customer service employee who considers herself part of the middle class. She said she liked Harris' toughness on abortion rights and her pledge to grow the middle class. ""I am definitely anti-Trump, but I believe I'm more pro-Harris.""Maricopa County played an important role in Biden's 2020 victory, when the county narrowly flipped Democratic after voting for Trump in 2016.Karen Davidson, 83, who lives in West Bloomfield, Michigan, a middle-class suburb of Detroit, said she had not been that familiar with Harris before she moved to the top of the ticket.""I needed to know more about her to form any kind of thought,"" Davidson said.""The way she stood up to people who were berating her, I had to respect that having been in the industrial machinery business when women didn't work in it, I know what that's like,"" Davidson continued. ""She had the strength, and that's what's needed to run our country.""In Pooler, Georgia, a suburb of Savannah, grocery store employee Kevin Garcia said he also was relieved Biden had bowed out and preferred Harris' pledges to support small businesses over Trump's promise to tax imported goods.""I just feel better about the chances,"" said Garcia, 24, who lives in a single-family home neighborhood in the state that, like Arizona, narrowly flipped Democratic in 2020.","Kamala Harris has erased Republican rival Donald Trump's advantage in the vast middle of American society.

"'Get a life, man': Biden fires back at Trump over hurricane misinformation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/get-a-life-man-biden-fires-back-at-trump-over-hurricane-misinformation/articleshow/114130576.cms,"Joe Biden and Donald Trump (Picture credit: Agencies)

President Joe Biden on Thursday told Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to ""get a life"" after the latter accused him and vice president Kamala Harris of responding slowly and ineffectively to the hurricanes. Biden also said that the federal government is working swiftly to support those affected by Hurricane Milton Biden had accused Trump of spreading misinformation about the federal hurricane response during a press briefing on Wednesday.When asked if he had communicated with Trump after his statement at the White House, Biden responded, “Are you kidding me?” He then addressed Trump directly, saying, “Mr President Trump — former President Trump — get a life, man. Help these people.”The federal government is actively countering misinformation, which started circulating after Hurricane Helene last month and has continued with Hurricane Milton this week. When asked again if he intended to speak with Trump, Biden firmly said, “No.”The president praised Florida residents for adhering to evacuation orders, stating that their actions helped save lives. However, he noted it’s still too early to assess the full damage from Hurricane Milton. “It’s too early to know the full account of the damage,” Biden said. “But we know lifesaving measures did make a difference.”Biden warned that “very dangerous conditions” still exist in the state and urged residents to follow local authorities' directives. He assured that federal support will continue for as long as needed. “Vice President Harris and I have been in constant contact with state and local officials,” he said. “We’re offering everything they need.”Biden also stressed that the public would hold Trump accountable for making false claims about FEMA 's capacity to assist storm victims. He mentioned speaking with Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, who confirmed their collaboration, saying, “I spoke with the president this morning…He said he wants to be helpful.”“Those who spread such lies are undermining confidence in the rescue and recovery efforts,” Biden said. “These lies are harmful to those who most need help. Lives are on the line, and people are in desperate situations — have the decency to tell them the truth.”Trump has heavily criticised Biden and Harris, calling their efforts “the worst response to a storm or hurricane disaster in US history.” At a campaign rally, Trump accused Harris of mismanaging the storm response in North Carolina and claimed that FEMA diverted funds to undocumented immigrants.Hurricane Milton left millions in Florida without power, while cleanup from Hurricane Helene continues across the Southeast.With less than four weeks until Election Day, Harris and Trump face a close race to succeed Biden, and disaster relief is a critical issue in key battleground states.","President Joe Biden told Donald Trump to ""get a life"" after the latter accused him and vice president Kamala Harris of responding slowly and ineffectively to the hurricanes.

The winner of this year's Fat Bear Contest has triumphed over the bear that tragically killed her cub this summer. Grazer secured her victory by defeating the formidable Chunk , receiving over 40,000 votes from fans watching live at Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve.The Fat Bear Contest invites fans to vote for their favourite bear based on winter preparedness, highlighting the fat accumulated during the summer months.Each year, 12 bears are pitted against each other in a tournament-style bracket. The bears feed on the abundant sockeye salmon that leap upstream at Brooks River, often catching them mid-air at the falls.Grazer’s cub met its fate after slipping over the waterfall, where it was killed by Chunk, the largest brown bear on the river. Grazer's attempts to save her cub were recorded on the live cameras, which have also documented other bear interactions, including a recent incident involving another bear, Bear 402, who was killed by a male bear just before the contest bracket was released.Grazer, easily recognisable by her distinctive blond ears and straight muzzle, is known for her strength and fearlessness, earning her the respect of other bears. Meanwhile, Chunk’s sheer size and aggression have allowed him to dominate the river, reportedly consuming 42 salmon in just ten hours.The annual contest, which attracted over 1.3 million votes last year, celebrates the resilience of the 2,200 brown bears inhabiting the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula. With live cameras capturing their activities, Katmai has become a popular tourist destination, offering viewing stands for visitors eager to witness these magnificent creatures in action.","Grazer defeated the formidable Chunk at Alaska’s Katmai National Park.

What to know about Hurricane Milton after it slammed Florida's Gulf Coast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-to-know-about-hurricane-milton-after-it-slammed-floridas-gulf-coast/articleshow/114134773.cms,"Contractors with the City of New Port Richey help clean debris left by Hurricane Helene in preparation for Hurricane Milton.

As Hurricane Milton barreled into and across Florida , it spawned dozens of tornadoes , knocked out power to millions, damaged homes, flooded neighborhoods and led to hundreds of rescues. But the damage wasn't as bad as had been feared.Gov. Ron DeSantis said that while the storm ""was significant,"" it ""was not the worst-case scenario."" He noted that as he flew over some of the hard-hit areas, he saw that many homes that were built in recent years fared well.""I've seen a lot of grit, I've seen a lot of determination and I'm very confident that this area is going to bounce back very, very quickly,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Sarasota , near where the storm made landfall on the Gulf CoastThe storm caused at least eight deaths in the state, where some communities were still dealing with the damage from deadly Hurricane Helene two weeks ago.Follow The Associated Press' coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes.Where did Milton make landfall, and where did it go next? Milton came ashore Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm in Siesta Key, a barrier island of white sand beaches about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of the Tampa Bay area.While the Tampa Bay area, home to over 3.3 million people, was spared a direct hit, there was still flooding and damage.By Thursday afternoon, Milton had moved off Florida's east coast and became a post-tropical cyclone that no longer had hurricane-force winds.How bad is the damage? Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding. Before Milton even made landfall, heavy rain and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida.The storm knocked out power across a large section of the state, leaving over 3 million homes and businesses without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports. By 9 p.m., that had dropped to 2.8 million.In St. Petersburg, a crane working on a 46-story building toppled and a water main break led the city to shut down service. Also the roof of Tropicana Field, home to the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team, was destroyed.Just inland from Tampa, the flooding in Plant City was ""absolutely staggering,"" according to City Manager Bill McDaniel.The National Weather Service said almost 19 inches (48 centimeters) of rain fell in the St. Petersburg area.A manufacturer of IV fluids critical to hospitals nationwide said its Daytona Beach factory and distribution center were left intact after Milton.How did people die in the hurricane? Officials were reporting at least eight deaths as of Thursday.Five people were killed when a tornado hit in the Spanish Lakes Country Club near Fort Pierce, on the Atlantic Coast, authorities said.In Volusia County, a 79-year-old woman in Ormond Beach and a 54-year-old woman in Port Orange died after trees crashed into their homes, the sheriff's office said.And in Tampa, police said the body of a woman in her 70s was found Thursday morning under a large tree branch.DeSantis said in the afternoon that search-and-rescue operations were ongoing, with at least 340 people and 49 pets rescued so far.How strong was Milton? It reached Category 5 strength with winds of 180 mph (290 kph) while still in the Gulf of Mexico, but then encountered wind shear nearing land that dropped it to Category 3 - less powerful but plenty strong. At landfall, maximum sustained winds were measured at 120 mph (about 205 kph).Storm surge - one of the most devastating elements of any hurricane - was believed to top out at 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters) in Sarasota County. That was less than feared. By comparison, Hurricane Ian's 15-foot (4.6-meter) storm surge devastated the community of Fort Myers Beach two years ago.Some might wonder if it is possible to control extreme weather events. But scientists say hurricanes are too powerful for that, and climate change is providing more fuel than ever for storms like Milton and Helene.What if I have plans to vacation in Florida? Three major theme parks in the Orlando area - Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld - all closed as Milton approached but planned to reopen on Friday.Several airports ceased operations as well. Orlando International Airport - the nation's seventh busiest and Florida's most trafficked - began receiving some domestic arrivals Thursday evening and said domestic and international departures would resume the following morning.The Orlando airport said it sustained only minor damage, including a few leaks and downed trees.Tampa's airport planned to reopen Friday morning.

WASHINGTON: Vice President Kamala Harris is as prepared for this job as any nominee for the president in the past, former president Barack Obama said on Thursday, noting that the November election will be ""tight"" between her and Republican candidate Donald Trump . ""Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been. That's who Kamala is. And in the White House, she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz,"" Obama told a cheering crowd in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, a battleground State, as the former president came out to address his first campaign rally for Harris in this election cycle.""If you elect Kamala and Tim, they won't be focused on their problems, they'll be focused on yours. They understand that too many folks here in Pennsylvania and across the country are struggling to pay the bills. Even though wages are steadily growing and inflation is finally slowing, the price of everything from health care to housing to groceries, it's still too high,"" he said.""That takes a real bite out of the paycheck. It hurts. The question is, who's really going to do something about it? That's what you should be asking yourself. Now, Donald Trump plans to do what he did last time - give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations,"" he said.Addressing thousands of his supporters in this battleground State, Obama said the election is going to be tight. ""This election is going to be tight because there are a lot of Americans who are still struggling out there. They're striving to make life better for themselves, for their families, and for their kids,"" he said.""Let's face it. As a country, we've been through a lot these last few years. We had a historic pandemic wreaking havoc on communities and businesses. Disruptions from the pandemic then caused prices to spike, and that put a strain on family budgets. In many ways, it's felt like the aspirations of working people have taken a backseat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful. So, I get why people are looking to shake things up,"" he said.Obama said he understood people's frustration and their feeling that they (President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris) could do better. ""What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you. I don't understand that. Because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself,"" he said.""Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago. You've got the tweets in all CAPS, the ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories. You've got the two-hour speeches, word salad... it's like Fidel Castro, just on and on,"" he alleged.""Constant attempts to sell you stuff. Who does that? Selling you gold sneakers and USD 100,000 watch and, most recently, a Trump Bible. He wants you to buy the Word of God, Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there next to Matthew and Luke. It's crazy. And the reason he does it is because all he cares about is his ego, money and his status,"" Obama said.""He's not thinking about you. Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to an end. He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him and his country club buddies. Doesn't care if he costs more women their reproductive freedom, because it won't make a difference in his life,"" he alleged.""Most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between real Americans who support him and the outsiders who don't. Because having people divided and angry, he figures, boosts his chances of being elected. He doesn't care who gets hurt,"" Obama said.""Think about it. Just the other day, we learned that on January 6, a couple of years ago, Donald Trump was told that Mike Pence was in the Capitol about 40 feet from an angry mob chanting, hang Mike Pence. And his response was 'So what?' If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his vice president, do you think he cares about you? We do not need four more years of that. We don't need four more years of arrogance, bumbling, bluster and division. America's ready to turn the page,"" Obama said.Eight years out of power, Obama has been one of the Democratic Party's most reliable surrogates to galvanise voters.As the nation's first Black president, Obama's appearance for Harris underscores the history-making nature of her own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month.Obama also appeared at a Harris fundraiser in California and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August.","Kamala Harris is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been, Obama says.

Referring to Trump’s alleged response to Mike Pence’s close encounter with rioters, Obama said, “If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?”He ended his speech by urging Pennsylvanians to vote. “We do not need four more years of arrogance and division,” Obama said. “We are ready for President Kamala Harris.”","Former President Barack Obama delivered a sharp critique of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.

A 59-year-old man was killed by a group of dogs on Wednesday evening in Albany, New York, in a backyard next to a house where around two dozen dogs were kept, according to police.The incident occurred at a residence on Central Avenue in Schenectady, where James Provost was fatally attacked by eight to nine mixed-breed pit bull dogs.Albany police arrived at the scene around 6 pm after receiving reports of an active dog attack.Upon arrival, officers found Provost being attacked by the dogs. One officer discharged his weapon, hitting one of the dogs and causing the others to disperse. Despite efforts to stop the attack, Provost was pronounced dead at the scene.A total of 24 dogs, including 15 puppies, were found at the residence and have been taken to the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society . The dogs' owner, who resides in Cohoes, was not present at the time of the attack.Police chief Eric Hawkins mentioned that the dogs were not kept in a traditional family setting, but their exact purpose is still unknown.“There are so many unanswered questions that we’re trying to sift through,” Hawkins said.Provost's connection to the dogs or their owner is unclear. Nearby witnesses reported hearing him shout for help during the attack.The investigation is ongoing as authorities work to understand how Provost ended up in the yard and the overall circumstances surrounding the case. They have also indicated that criminal charges against the owner may be possible.“We’re going to do everything we can to bring justice for this person who was viciously attacked,” Hawkins added.Officials had previously seized dogs from the same residence in May during a search related to drug activity, although the dogs were not the primary focus of that investigation.","A 59-year-old man was killed by a group of dogs on Wednesday evening in Albany, New York.

Ron DeSantis: Kamala Harris is trying to ‘politicize the storm’

Florida governor Ron DeSantis on Thursday criticised Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris for trying to involve herself in the response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, saying she has ""no role"" in the process.DeSantis recently refused a call from Harris about the hurricane response, while Harris accused him of being ""utterly irresponsible"" and ""selfish.""In an interview with Fox News, DeSantis said he has been collaborating with President Joe Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) for over two weeks, but claimed Harris never reached out to Florida or offered support.""Although I've worked well with the president, she has never called Florida. She has never offered any support,"" DeSantis said.He accused Harris of politicising the disaster for her campaign and reiterated that he had no time for political games amidst the recovery efforts.""I don’t have time for those games. I don’t care about her campaign. Obviously, I'm not a supporter of hers, but she has no role in this process. I'm working with the people I need to be working with,"" he added.DeSantis also mentioned that he had worked well with both Trump and Biden during previous storms.The issue was raised at the White House when a reporter asked President Biden if it was the governor's responsibility to take the vice president's calls. Biden responded, ""All I can tell you is I’ve talked to Governor DeSantis. He's been very gracious. He thanked me for all we've done. He knows what we're doing, and I think that's important."" Biden reportedly was unaware of the dispute between DeSantis and Harris over hurricane recovery efforts before describing DeSantis as ""gracious."" He remained focused solely on managing the disaster response , according to reports.Biden has had several calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began approaching the Southeast two weeks ago, followed by Hurricane Milton 's landfall on Wednesday. Biden instructed both DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if more support was needed. DeSantis confirmed that his federal requests for additional support had been met.During a broadcast warning about Hurricane Milton, which reached Category 3 status with winds up to 120 mph, Biden condemned misinformation surrounding Hurricane Helene. He specifically mentioned former President Donald Trump as spreading misinformation.",Florida governor Ron DeSantis criticised Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris for trying to involve herself in the response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil.

ISLAMABAD: The JUI-F has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition on a proposed constitutional amendment , according to a media report on Wednesday. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.

Pakistan's KP CM still missing from Islamabad; home minister denies reports of arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-kp-cm-still-missing-from-islamabad-home-minister-denies-reports-of-arrest/articleshow/113992557.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur ’s whereabouts remained unknown on Sunday, a day after he mysteriously went missing from Islamabad, where he led a massive rally of Pashtun supporters of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).Hundreds of Khan’s supporters had arrived in Islamabad from various parts of the country on Friday to participate in a protest at D-Chowk, in front of the parliament building.Gandapur’s rally joined the protesters on Saturday. He then left the party workers and moved to the nearby KP official guest house, from where he “disappeared,” sparking rumours about his arrest.The KP govt Sunday approached Peshawar high court against the disappearance of Gandapur, Geo News reported. KP advocate general Shah Faisal said that a writ petition had been prepared and the court would be requested to take it up.Home minister Mohsin Naqvi denied PTI’s allegations that the CM had been abducted by police or intelligence agencies. “Ali Amin Gandapur is neither in our ( Islamabad police ) custody nor in the custody of any other Pakistani institution,” Naqvi said, adding that police had conducted three raids at various locations on Saturday night where they suspected Gandapur might be.“He was not found there. We still have blockades at certain points in the city and are actively searching for him,” Naqvi said.He told reporters he had pictures of Gandapur fleeing from the main door of one of the locations police raided last night to apprehend him. “He himself is on the run, and I don’t know why. But if he is in Islamabad territory, police will deal with him as per the law, as they are definitely searching for him,” Naqvi said.In Peshawar, the provincial capital, a large number of PTI supporters staged a protest outside KP assembly for Gandapur’s release. Meanwhile, a fresh police case was filed against Khan and 104 of his PTI members on Sunday after a police constable, injured during last night’s protest in the federal capital, succumbed to his wounds. Charges of terrorism, attempted murder, kidnapping, interference in state affairs, and assault on police personnel were framed against them.Islamabad police reported that constable Abdul Hameed Shah passed away while receiving treatment in the hospital. “Miscreants kept torturing police constable Shah after abducting him. Protesters who had entered Islamabad with the KP CM have left. No protesters are currently in Islamabad, and the roads are partially open,” police spokesperson Muhammad Taqi Jawad said.Home minister said that 564 individuals were arrested, including 120 Afghan nationals and 11 KP police personnel. He noted that 31 Islamabad police and 75 Punjab police personnel were injured but they had not opened fire on the protesters, in line with the govt’s policy to avoid loss of life.Naqvi said he had ordered a high-level inquiry into how a provincial police force became involved in the protest and “attacked other police officers,” adding that “this has happened for the first time in Pakistan.”","KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur mysteriously went missing from Islamabad.
