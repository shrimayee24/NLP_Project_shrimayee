Charlie Kirk 'ASSASSIN' On Cam: FBI Releases Photos Of Shooting Suspect | BREAKING NEWS





Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot Thursday while speaking at Utah Valley University.As law enforcement continues its manhunt for the suspect, an odd development has added to the confusion: Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “The Shooting of Charlie Kirk: A Comprehensive Account of the Utah Valley University Attack, the Aftermath, and America’s Response,” credited to an author named Anastasia J Casey.According to the screenshots, the listed publication date was September 9—one day before the shooting. The listing was allegedly visible on Amazon briefly before being removed. The images of the cover, title, and date quickly spread across X, fueling speculation about foreknowledge or a cover-up.“Can someone investigate this perhaps? It’s now pulled from Amazon online listing. Who is Anastasia Casey? Regardless of the credibility of the 9.9 publish date, how did this book get out so quick,” one user wrote.Another post read: “But check this out, another book published today? How the hell can you get a book published and up for sale in such short time ??? @FBIDirectorKash @AGPamBondi @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr.”Some users drew comparisons to past events. “A book entitled ‘The Shooting of Charlie Kirk’ by Anastasia J Casey has appeared on Amazon with a PUBLICATION DATE OF SEPTEMBER 9TH 2025. A DAY BEFORE HE WAS ASSASSINATED,” one person commented.Others pointed out more examples. “This is like the 9/11 reporting strangeness. Something is off on how quickly these people are making these books. There are 2-3 more published yesterday about Charlie's assassination. One is 36 pages,” another user noted.Amazon in a statement said that they have taken down the title in question. “We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we remove books that do not adhere to these guidelines. The title in question is no longer available for sale. Due to a technical issue, the date of publication that had been displayed for this title, while it was briefly listed, was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells. They also seized the students' mobile phones, laptops, and other personal belongings from the room.While the exact sequence of events is unclear, police are examining the possibility of a confrontation between the two students.Bimtech did not respond to requests for a comment.",Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech) It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired.

But, despite scaling down on the political front, “we have been turned into beggars”, he said.“It is better to fight for our rights and be defeated than to resort to begging every day for every small thing,” he asserted.Mehdi, who was invited by the civil society of Anantnag to address people at the town hall, alleged that the district administration locked the building, forcing organisers to change the venue. “People were threatened and intimidated not to attend my meeting. If such tactics are adopted, where are we supposed to go?” he questioned.Referring to the arrest of AAP MLA Mehraj Malik under Public Safety Act, Mehdi said it was a warning to all political voices.Iftikhar Misgar, president of Anantnag Federation of Chambers of Industries Kashmir, said the MP was scheduled to address the gathering at the town hall, but the administration on Thursday declared the building unsafe and locked it, even though forest minister Javed Rana had addressed a gathering there just a day earlier.Reacting to Mehdi’s allegation, former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said it was “unfortunate” that a sitting MP was not allowed to hold a meeting by his own govt. “At a time when Farooq sahib and Omar sahib are rightly voicing concern over the arrest of MLA Mehraj Malik, such restrictions on their own party’s MP raise serious questions. It exposes a disturbing level of double standards and political hypocrisy,” she said.","Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi once again launched a sharp attack on his own party, National Conference.

Police Form SIT To Probe Kolkata Rape Case After Victim's Father Denies Assault

LONDON: A British-born Sikh woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted, raped and beaten in a racially motivated attack on Tuesday in Oldbury, near Birmingham, by two white men.West Midlands police confirmed to TOI they are investigating the rape which the woman claims happened between 8 am and 8.30 am, and they are treating it as a racially aggravated attack.“The woman has told us that a racist remark was made to her during the attack,” a police spokesperson said.According to Sikh Federation (UK), during the attack the rapists shouted at her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.”A West Midlands Police spokesperson said they were called just before 8.30 am on Sept 9 after the woman reported being attacked in the area around Tame Road.The two attackers are described as being white. One had a shaved head, heavy build, and was wearing a dark sweatshirt and gloves. The second was wearing a grey zipped top.MP Gurinder Singh Josan, whose constituency office is just minutes away from where the rape happened, said: “This is a truly horrific attack and my thoughts are with the victim. I am reassured Sandwell police are doing everything they possibly can to find the perpetrators. The incident is being treated as a hate crime. The police are working extremely sympathetically with the victim, who has been traumatised.”Sikh Youth UK has met and is supporting the victim and her family.Chief Superintendent Kim Madill, of Sandwell police, said: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other enquiries well under way. We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused. Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols.”The rape follows the recent unprovoked attack on two British Sikh taxi drivers, Satnam Singh (64) and Jasbir Sangha (72), on Aug 15 outside Wolverhampton station during which Singh’s turban was ripped off. British Transport Police are treating that as a racially aggravated assault. A teenager and two men were arrested and released on bail.","A British-born Sikh woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted, raped and beaten in a racially motivated attack on Tuesday in Oldbury, near Birmingham.

Is Kash Patel Hindu ?

""To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother.

In Norse mythology, it is believed that warriors who die bravely in battle are chosen by Odin and enter Valhalla.Kash Patel came under fire in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's death, as the FBI got the wrong person initially, whom they let out after they realized he was not the shooter.

The minister then called a deputy with the federal agency, and the FBI took Robinson into custody.Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump confirmed that the Charlie Kirk shooter is in custody. “I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him,” Trump told “Fox & Friends” during a live interview at the cable giant’s Manhattan studio, saying he heard just minutes before his 8 am interview. “Somebody who was very close to him turned him in,” the president said, then revealing it was the suspect’s dad who relayed it through “a minister who was involved with law enforcement.That 'somebody who was very close to him' was his father.""Matt Robinson is a good father who did the right thing.

Three unfired casings found in the chamber of the rifle reportedly used by Robinson included left-wing slogans such as “Hey fascist!

'Not that far apart on a deal'





US president Donald Trump on Friday said his decision to impose a 50% tariff on India over its purchases of Russian oil is “a big deal” that “caused a rift” between the two countries.Speaking on Fox & Friends, the US President said the move was not taken lightly but was necessary to send a message. “Look, India was their biggest customer. I put a 50 per cent tariff on India because they're buying oil from Russia. That's not an easy thing to do. That's a big deal and it causes a rift with India,” he said.Trump, who has made confronting Moscow’s energy trade a key part of his foreign policy, insisted he had already taken significant steps against Russia. “But I've already done it. I've done a lot,” he said, adding: “Remember this is a Europe problem, much more than our problem.”In the same interview, he repeated his claim that his presidency has brought an end to multiple conflicts around the world. “I solved seven wars. I did so many, including Pakistan and India, but big ones, some were unsolvable, Congo and Rwanda. I solved it. It was going on for 31 years, millions of people killed.I solve wars that was unsolvable,” he said.On August 7, the United States imposed a 25% tariff on India, along with an additional 25% punitive tariff, citing New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. India has strongly rejected the allegation, calling the tariffs ""unjustified and unreasonable.""The tariffs on India come at a sensitive time in US-India relations. Washington’s ambassador-designate to Delhi, Sergio Gor, told senators this week that India’s protectionist policies had created obstacles but emphasised the partnership remained strong. He said President Trump had a “deep friendship” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling it “incredible” given the tariffs.Gor also said a trade deal could be close. “We are not that far apart right now on a deal. In fact, they're negotiating the nitty-gritty of a deal,” he explained, suggesting an agreement could be reached within weeks.","'Not that far apart on a deal' between US and India, US ambassador-designate to Delhi says.

Neighbours shocked

Strong academic background





Tyler James Robinson , the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, had no criminal history before his arrest on Friday.Robinson, from Washington, Utah, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause statement released Friday. A judge has ordered that he be held without bail.Neither state nor federal records show any past criminal cases against him. Authorities believe he acted alone.Neighbours in Washington and nearby St George reacted with shock after the arrest, describing Robinson as quiet and reserved.Jaida Funk, 22, who lives in the same neighbourhood, said Robinson’s arrest came as a complete shock. She said news of it spread quickly among her friends. “Often, when someone is identified as a shooter, people say you could see it coming. But he wasn’t one of those people,” she said, as quoted by news agency Associated Press.Durban Mickelson, who worked at a store Robinson often visited, said he never stood out. “He wouldn’t talk unless you spoke to him first. He was always very quiet and kept to himself,” Mickelson recalled.Utah state records show Robinson is a registered voter but not linked to any political party.He is listed as inactive, meaning he did not vote in the last two general elections. The probable cause statement lists his address as his parents’ six-bedroom home, where they run a granite countertop business. Both parents are registered Republicans.His family told investigators that he had recently become “more political.” At a dinner table conversation, he mentioned Kirk’s visit to Utah Valley University and expressed dislike for his views, calling Kirk “full of hate and spreading hate.”A family member helped lead police to him after he allegedly admitted or implied involvement in the shooting, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said.Beyond the investigation, Robinson’s background shows a different picture. He had been an honour roll student in high school, scoring in the top percentile nationally on standardised tests.He briefly attended Utah State University on a scholarship before enrolling in an electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College.","Tyler James Robinson, 22, had no criminal history before his arrest on Friday.

Glitch Fuels Speculation: Trump Posted 'Fake' Video After Charlie Kirk’s Death?

The conspiracy theories

The pushback

The investigation continues





The fatal shooting of conservative youth leader Charles “Charlie” Kirk at a Utah university on Thursday has now taken a dramatic turn online, where thousands are dissecting every frame of video footage for hidden clues.In videos viewed millions of times on X, two men standing behind Kirk just moments before the bullet struck are under the scanner. One, wearing a white T-shirt and cap, can be seen fiddling with his hat, brushing his ear, and shifting his phone forward. A second man, believed by many to be Kirk’s longtime security guard, appears to adjust his shirt sleeve and make a subtle gesture with his hand.Mere seconds later, the crack of a rifle echoed through the packed tent of nearly 3,000 people. Kirk collapsed, hit in the neck, as panic tore through the crowd.The timing of the gestures has led some users to suggest the two men were signaling the shooter. “Good catch,” one user posted. Another wrote, “Real people already finding out more info than MSM.” Others even tagged FBI Director Kash Patel, demanding an investigation.Adding fuel to the frenzy, additional video angles show the man in the white cap instantly dropping to the ground as shots rang out before fleeing behind the tent with others.For some, that quick reaction looked rehearsed.But not everyone is convinced. Many called the theories reckless and disrespectful. “The guy in the black has been Charlie’s security guard for as long as I can remember,” one person wrote. Another argued simply: “These two are in the line of fire tho?”For now, federal investigators remain focused on hard evidence. The FBI has confirmed recovery of a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to have been used in the attack but has not addressed the online claims of signaling. No arrests have been made.The divide is clear: while America mourns, parts of the internet are locked in a frenzied hunt for meaning in every gesture, whether coincidence or conspiracy.","The fatal shooting of conservative youth leader Charles “Charlie’ Kirk at a Utah university on Thursday has now taken a dramatic turn online.

Utah governor Spencer Cox said Friday that while he was grateful for the quick arrest of a suspect in Charlie Kirk’s assassination, he had hoped the shooter was not from Utah or the US - a comment that drew online criticism.During a news conference, Cox said he had prayed that the shooter “wouldn’t be one of us.”“For 33 hours, I was praying that if this had to happen here that it wouldn't be one of us — that somebody drove from another state, somebody came from another country… Sadly, that prayer was not answered the way I hoped for… But it did happen here, and it was one of us,” he added.Cox called Kirk’s murder “an attack not just on an individual but on democratic principles.” He warned that political violence threatens the foundation of American society, saying, “It is an attack on the American experiment. It is an attack on our ideals. This cuts to the very foundation of who we are.”Cox’s comments prompted a wave of reactions online. One person commented, “The guy being a straight white male from a Republican household was absolutely devastating for them. They will push the mental health narrative now since they do not want it to be a gun issue.”Another called out the irony of him saying this with Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel standing behind him. “He thought it was the brown guy behind him?”“These people can't stop exposing themselves. He says he was praying it was an immigrant to justify their emotional racist view points. You can't make this up,” commented one person.Tyler Robinson is currently being held at the Utah County Jail in Spanish Fork on charges including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice, according to a jail officer.The FBI and state authorities confirmed the attack was targeted, raising concerns about the growing threat of political violence in the U.S.US Vice President JD Vance expressed gratitude to Governor Cox and law enforcement for their swift work in the case. In a post on X, Vance wrote, “I am grateful to Governor Spencer Cox, Utah law enforcement, Kash Patel, and the FBI for giving this case the time, resources, and hard work it deserved.

Brittany Mahomes, co-owner of the Kansas City Current and wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , appeared to subtly address the shocking assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk with a cryptic social media post. Her message, shared on Instagram just a day after the incident, has fueled speculation about where she stands amid the political firestorm.On Thursday, Brittany reshared a quote from author Sharon McMahon that read, “Hate will not get us out of this mess.” The post continued, “Your feelings might lie and try to tell you otherwise, but hate doesn’t know how to heal or build, only how to harm and destroy.”While Brittany never directly mentioned Kirk, the timing was notable. The 30-year-old posted it shortly after Kirk was fatally shot in the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University, an event that has shaken both political and sports circles.This isn’t the first time Brittany has been linked to political controversy. In August 2024, she came under scrutiny for “liking” a Make America Great Again post on Instagram. At the time, she defended herself, saying, “To be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood.There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.” Former President Donald Trump later praised her, calling her “beautiful. ”Kirk’s assassination has triggered strong reactions across the sports world. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker condemned the violence, while Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy admitted he increased his personal security following the shooting.On the other side, backlash emerged too. The Carolina Panthers dismissed a communications staffer for joking about the incident, and a transgender Team USA cyclist stirred controversy by celebrating Kirk’s death online.Meanwhile, authorities announced the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who is suspected of carrying out the attack.Brittany Mahomes has not clarified whether her post was aimed at Kirk’s killing or simply a broader statement.

Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe ignited controversy this week following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Known for his outspoken views, Kluwe took to social media platform BlueSky to criticize political rhetoric, sharply targeting the GOP’s role in fostering division within American society.Chris Kluwe, who was dismissed earlier this year from his high school coaching job after calling the MAGA movement a “Nazi movement,” did not hold back his anger. In a blunt post, he praised Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democrat rhetoric led to Kirk’s assassination.He wrote, “F**ing finally. Fight back against the bulls framing that tries to make Dems responsible for everything. The GOP is choosing to create this kind of societal environment. They could stop it at any time. They have agency as well. They’re not f***ing children (except when, well, you know).”This forceful statement underscores Kluwe’s belief that the political climate has been deteriorating due to the GOP’s actions.Earlier, Kluwe added that Charlie Kirk helped create “the kind of society he currently lives in.” He posted, “It is possible to hold both of these things true at the same time: 1) political violence is never an appropriate choice in a civilized society 2) Charlie Kirk’s dream is to create exactly the kind of society he currently lives in, as spoken from his own mouth.”Kluwe’s comments have drawn both criticism and support, fueling intense debate over the responsibility of public figures in shaping national discourse.Also Read: NFL’s silence on Charlie Kirk’s tragic death is sparking controversy and raising questions Currently campaigning for a California state assembly seat, Kluwe remains unyielding in his activism, even after his controversial firing and multiple public arrests protesting MAGA initiatives.

A North Carolina family reeling from unimaginable tragedy is finding unexpected support from NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal. The Ellis family of Chadbourn lost four young daughters in a devastating house fire on August 30, and O’Neal has stepped in to cover the funeral expenses in partnership with the Henry County Sheriff’s Office. The gesture comes as the community continues to grieve the loss of four lives cut short far too soon.The fire claimed the lives of Kalani Rae, Kendall Xaiya, Josephina Renee, and Sophia Nachelle, ages 2 through 7. Their father, Patrick Ellis, and eldest daughter Willow, 11, managed to escape. In the aftermath, O’Neal, who serves as the director of community relations for the Henry County Sheriff’s Office, reached out to Sheriff Reginald Scandrett to offer help.""It touches every one of us parents, neighbors and human beings,"" O’Neal said (via Fox 5).

Epstein's 'chilling' secrets exposed with bombshell personal email 'trove' on Maxwell, Trump, others





Hundreds of emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s personal Yahoo account, obtained by Bloomberg News, shed new light on Ghislaine Maxwell’s close partnership with him.The trove of more than 18,000 messages, most active between 2005 and 2008, shows Maxwell was far more involved in Epstein’s affairs than she has publicly admitted.For years, Maxwell has tried to portray herself as a distant bystander, claiming she was a former girlfriend turned property manager, unaware of Epstein’s inner workings or criminal activity. The emails now suggest otherwise, revealing her knowledge of his legal jeopardy and her participation in various financial, business, and personal matters.Although Epstein’s emails rarely mention Trump, there are a few notable references.The emails shows that their messages were usually informal and full of spelling errors.“Question,” Epstein wrote to Maxwell on May 23, 2008. “Which one do you prefer,,, lewd and lscivious conduct ,, or procuring minors for prostituion.”Maxwell’s response was, “I suppose Lewd and lecivious conduct..I would prefer lewd and lescivious conduct w/a prositute if possible”Picture source: BloombergThe reported emails also show Maxwell exchanging messages with Epstein about gifts for their wealthy friends.One email included a detailed 2007 spreadsheet from an accountant, listing $1.8 million in presents sent between 2003 and 2006. The emails also show them discussing a shared fertility treatment.In 2014, Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, accused Ghislaine Maxwell of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls. Shortly after, Maxwell emailed Epstein asking,Can you send me the file on Virginia that your lawyers have or whatever info you have on her.”On January 3, 2015, Maxwell circulated a confidential 20-page report from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. The report detailed how Giuffre, then 15, had accused two male acquaintances of rape, but the complaint was dropped due to “the victim’s lack of credibility.”Ten days later, on January 13, Maxwell forwarded Epstein an email chain between their lawyers discussing how Giuffre’s allegations could trigger a new police investigation into Maxwell in the UK. She wrote, “I guess they are fishing to see if I can have allegations against me. This would take whatever slim shred of a life I have after this mess and kill it.”“Plse review list and add or remove peeps,” Maxwell wrote on Sept. 14, 2006.“Remove Trump,” Epstein replied.The email contained a list of 51 politicians, business executives, and Wall Street figures. The purpose of the list is unclear, as there is no subject line or additional commentary.Picture source: BloombergTrump’s name appeared again in August 2007, during Epstein’s lobbying to drop federal charges. The emails suggest Maxwell expected reporters to seek information from Trump and other high-profile figures connected to Epstein’s network. ""You have to assume they went to Donald Trump then, gossman, the docs in wpb, paschow etc,"" Maxwell wrote.The US president has faced pressure to release the justice department’s full files on the sex offender. So far, he has refused and is also suing The Wall Street Journal for defamation over claims that he sent Epstein a risqué 50th birthday letter.","Hundreds of emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s personal Yahoo account, obtained by Bloomberg News, shed new light on Ghislaine Maxwell's close partnership with him.

Nepal Crisis: Gen Z Picks Country's First Female Chief Justice Sushila Karki As Interim PM

Who is Sushila Karki?

Sushila Karki





Nepal’s former Chief Justice Sushila Karki—the only woman to hold that post—has been chosen to lead the country’s interim administration, ending days of speculation over who would serve as caretaker prime minister following the collapse of the KP Sharma Oli government after youth-led protests.Nepal's Parliament has been dissolved as well.""President Ram Chandra Paudel will appoint former chief justice Sushila Karki as the prime minister,"" presidential press adviser Kiran Pokharel said in a statement, as reported by AFP.The oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for 8:45 pm local time (8:30 pm IST), according to reports.Karki, an alumna of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in India, was among four candidates before being finally selected following consultations involving President Poudel, Army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel, and representatives of the youth demonstrators, dubbed “Gen Z.”Also in the running were former Nepal Electricity Authority chief Kulman Ghising, Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, and Dharan mayor Harka Sampang.The ""Gen Z"" protests, initially sparked by a controversial social media ban, escalated into a broader rejection of corruption, nepotism and entrenched political elites. Soldiers remain deployed across Kathmandu after demonstrators torched government buildings, politicians’ residences and the parliament.Sushila Karki made history in July 2016 when she became Nepal’s first female chief justice. Her tenure, however, ended less than a year later after lawmakers filed an impeachment motion accusing her of “delivering biased verdicts” and ""interfering"" in executive jurisdiction. The move followed a Nepal Supreme Court ruling that struck down the government’s decision on police chief appointments, saying seniority had been unfairly bypassed.Although automatically suspended while the probe was pending, the impeachment failed to secure the two-thirds majority required before her retirement in June 2017.Born on June 7, 1952, in Biratnagar, the ex-jurist studied political science at BHU in 1975 and law at Tribhuvan University in 1978. Before becoming chief justice, she served as a Supreme Court justice, senior advocate and law professor. She is also an author on gender equality and has long been involved in human rights and women’s judicial organisations.Karki has been recognised with awards including the Sambhav Kanoon Puraskar (2004).",Nepal's former Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been chosen to lead the country’s interim administration.

KATHMANDU: Sushila Karki took over as Nepal's PM Friday, after two days of discussions and a public vote held by Gen Z group protesters, but the latter decided not to be a part of the interim dispensation.Residents of Kathmandu TOI spoke to said the development had brought a ""sense of relief"".

We hope for cleaner governance too.""Abiskar Chhetri, 27, said, ""We are happy a person with proven integrity like Sushila Karki will lead the nation.

It led to public anger, eventually forcing state to recall the motion.

FBI Releases Video Footage Of Charlie Kirk’s Killer; Trump Demands Death Penalty





At an emotional news conference on Friday, Erika Kirk spoke publicly for the first time since the assasination of her husband, conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.At the beginning, Erika addressed US president Donald Trump and said, “My husband loved you, and he knew you loved him too. Your friendship was amazing.”She thanked vice president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance for standing by her family. “You honoured my husband so well, bringing him home. You are tremendous,” she said, calling them “dear friends” of her husband.Erika, who fought back tears several times during her address, further said her husband “laid down his life for me, for our nation, for our children,” and prayed that “Charlie be received into the merciful arms of Jesus, our loving Saviour.”Speaking about his life, she recalled how Charlie wanted to be remembered for “his courage and his faith.” She said he loved America, nature, and sports, especially the Chicago Cubs and Oregon Ducks.But above all, “Charlie loved his children, and he loved me with all of his heart, and I knew that every day,” she added.Erika recalled how two days ago, her husband went to see ""the face of his saviour and his God."" ""One of the last conversations he had on this earth was witnessing for his lord and saviour, Jesus Christ,” she said.She also called out those responsible for his killing. “The evildoers who assassinated my husband have no idea what they have done. They killed Charlie because he preached a message of patriotism, faith, and God’s merciful love. If you thought his mission was powerful before, you have no idea what you have unleashed across this country and within this wife,” she said.“In a world filled with chaos, doubt and uncertainty, my husband’s voice will remain and it will ring out louder and more clearly than ever and his wisdom will endure,” she said.Erika also spoke directly to her late husband, saying, “Charlie, baby. Charlie, I promise, I will never let your legacy die. I won’t. I’ll make TPUSA the biggest thing this nation has ever seen. I promise. Charlie, I love you. I love you, baby. Rest in the arms of our lord.”Erika also shared the painful moment of telling her three-year-old daughter why her father was not coming home. “Where’s daddy?” What do you tell a 3-year-old? I said, “Baby, daddy loves you so much. He’s on a work trip with Jesus,"" Erika said.Erika praised local, state and federal authorities for moving quickly to capture the suspect in Kirk’s killing. “They worked tirelessly to capture my husband’s assassin so that he could be brought to justice,” she said.Charlie Kirk, co-founder of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon.","Erika Kirk spoke publicly for the first time since the assasination of her husband, conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.

Charlie Kirk: How One Assassination Broke America; Trump's Response Changes Everything





The White House on Friday shared a tribute video for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed earlier this week in Utah.The post was captioned, “In loving memory of Charlie Kirk, a fearless patriot and man of unwavering faith who dedicated his life to America. ‘It’s bigger than you, I want you to remember that… It’s bigger than me – you are here to make somebody else’s life better, the pursuit of liberty and freedom. ’”The video played clips of Kirk along with audio from his earlier speeches. He said, “Only in America is it possible to say, you know what, I don’t like the way the country is going, and to do something about it. Take that risk, take that leap of faith, stay involved, trust God, and act obediently.”He said that God uses all things for good for those who love him. He added, “It’s bigger than you. I want you to remember, it is bigger than you. It’s bigger than me. You are here to make somebody else’s life better, the pursuit of liberty and freedom.”Kirk spoke about drawing strength from the “hundreds of thousands” who supported him. ""You are here to make somebody else's life better, the pursuit of liberty and freedom.You know what gives me strength? The hundreds of thousands of you that say, Charlie, keep going.He also pointed to what he called “evidence” of Jesus Christ. ""So that's all pretty amazing evidence, not just intra-biblical evidence, but extra-biblical evidence that Jesus Christ was a real person. He lived a perfect life. He was crucified, died, and rose on the third day, and he is Lord and God of all.Kirk was shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University in what officials called a targeted attack.

FBI Releases Video Footage Of Charlie Kirk’s Killer; Trump Demands Death Penalty





Police evacuated the neighborhood around Tyler Robinson’s family home in Utah on Friday, just hours after the 22-year-old was identified as the suspect accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a college event.According to Fox News, officers received “concerning information” from the residence, though investigators did not specify what triggered the response. Videos from the scene showed dozens of police cars, officers on the ground, and a helicopter circling overhead.The evacuation came the same day Robinson was taken into custody. He faces multiple felony charges, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and discharging a firearm causing serious injury, according to a probable cause affidavit.Authorities say Robinson shot and killed Kirk, 31, co-founder of Turning Point USA, while Kirk was speaking to students at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Kirk was rushed to a hospital and later died. The FBI and state officials said the attack was targeted, fueling concerns about political violence.Governor Spencer Cox confirmed Robinson “acted alone” and said the suspect had grown more political and increasingly hostile toward conservative figures in recent years.At the time of his arrest, he was wearing clothing that matched surveillance images released earlier in the week. Ammunition recovered at the scene carried engravings linked to internet meme culture and references to fascism, according to Cox.State and federal records show Robinson is registered to vote in Utah with no party affiliation. He was listed as inactive after missing the last two general elections and had no prior criminal history.Robinson grew up in a suburb of St George, about three and a half hours from the Utah Valley University campus. He was raised in a close household by parents who have been married for about 25 years, run a granite countertop business, and are registered Republicans. Robinson has two younger brothers, reported AP.","Police evacuated the neighborhood around Tyler Robinson's family home on Friday.

US condemns decision, warns of response



Divided Brazil, inflamed politics



Bolsonaro’s future







Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Thursday after the country’s Supreme Court convicted him of attempting a coup to remain in power following his 2022 electoral defeat to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.The unprecedented ruling handed down by a panel of five justices, four of whom voted to convict, makes Bolsonaro the first former Brazilian leader found guilty of trying to overturn a democratic election. He was convicted on five counts, including plotting to abolish the rule of law, belonging to an armed criminal organisation, and inciting violence.Bolsonaro, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, remains under house arrest in Brasilia. He can still appeal the decision. The court now has 60 days to publish the ruling, after which his lawyers will have five days to file motions for clarification. Legal experts say such appeals rarely change outcomes.The ruling immediately sparked international backlash, most notably from Washington. US President Donald Trump said he was “very unhappy” with the conviction, calling Bolsonaro “outstanding.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio denounced the ruling as a “witch hunt” in a post on X, vowing the Trump administration would “respond accordingly.”The United States had already slapped a 50 per cent tariff on Brazilian goods earlier this year, citing the case against Bolsonaro — a move analysts say foreshadowed further sanctions.In Brazil, the trial has inflamed political tensions. Supporters of the far-right leader have taken to the streets, claiming the case is political persecution. His eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict a “supreme persecution,” insisting history would vindicate his father.Justice Cármen Lúcia, siding with the majority, said she was persuaded by evidence from the Attorney General’s Office. “He is the instigator, the leader of an organisation that orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power,” she said. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case, branded Bolsonaro the head of a criminal coup plot.President Lula said Thursday that “hundreds of pieces of evidence” showed Bolsonaro attempted a coup against Brazil’s democracy.Bolsonaro is already barred from running for office until 2030 in a separate case, but he remains an influential figure in Brazilian politics. Observers expect him to back a political heir to challenge Lula in the next election.Despite Thursday’s ruling, Bolsonaro will not immediately go to prison. But with appeals unlikely to succeed and diplomatic tensions rising, Brazil now faces a volatile period of political and international fallout.","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison.
