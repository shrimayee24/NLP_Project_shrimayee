Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: The prospect of disruption looms over an already truncated winter session of Parliament as a united opposition on Sunday pressed for a discussion on SIR, an issue that had all but washed out the previous session, as govt remained non-committal to its demand.At an all-party meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Congress and a host of other opposition parties also sought debate on several other issues, including national security following the Delhi blast, and rising air pollution, but the nationwide Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls emerged as their rallying point.Ram Gopal Yadav of SP, whose contingent of 37 Lok Sabha members is the second largest in the opposition, sent out an ominous message as the 19-day session covering 15 sitting begins Monday. “We will not allow Parliament to function if a discussion is not held on SIR,” he said, alleging the review of rolls is marred by irregularities and that some booth-level officers ended their lives due to stress. Many SP lawmakers, including him, have been put on “C category” (requiring more documentation), as a targeted segment of voters is being deleted from rolls, he claimed.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told the opposition that he would get back to them on their demand after consulting key govt functionaries, but gave no assurance.Rijiju had in the last session cited a ruling by then LS Speaker Balram Jakhar in 1988, when Congress was in office, that the House could not debate decisions and functioning of Election Commission to reject opposition’s demand for a discussion on SIR.The opposition’s protest had washed out LS and Rajya Sabha proceedings, except for a discussion on Operation Sindoor, in that session.At Sunday’s meeting, BJP ally and JDU working president Sanjay Jha made light of the opposition's case against SIR by highlighting that its strident stand cut little ice with people in Bihar, the first state where it was carried out, and no voter or political party came forward with any official complaint.In the meeting attended by 50 representatives from 36 parties, govt shared 14 items, including 13 bills, of its tentative agenda and sought the opposition’s support. Rijiju conveyed govt’s keenness on a discussion of Vande Mataram, the national song whose 150th anniversary was observed with much fervour recently by BJP-led NDA.Congress later held a strategy meet of its key leaders with sources saying the party was veering to the stand that the demand for a SIR discussion was non-negotiable.In business advisory meetings of LS and RS, in which govt and opposition functionaries work out Parliament’s agenda, the deadlock remained. Some opposition members, including CPM’s John Brittas, suggested a short-duration discussion on electoral reforms to get around govt’s unwillingness to discuss SIR as the issue can also cover the ongoing exercise in 12 states and UTs.",Opposition pressed for a discussion on Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls.

"Assam's land a magnet for illegals, says report 'suppressed' for 41 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assams-land-a-magnet-for-illegals-says-report-suppressed-for-41-years-junks-narrative-that-83-nellie-killings-were-communal/articleshow/125682292.cms,"The report had made recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, defining ‘Assamese’ identity and safeguarding it

GUWAHATI: Successive govts in Assam allowed the state's ""land and identity crisis"" to fester for four decades while they kept under wraps a report that had flagged it as a ticking time bomb that led to the 1983 Nellie massacre, among other disturbances.The Tribhuvan Prasad Tewary Commission, tasked by the then Congress govt to investigate the Jan-April 1983 cycle of violence accompanying the anti-foreigner movement of the time, made multiple recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, evicting infiltrators, defining ""Assamese"" identity, and safeguarding it.The first AGP ministry tabled the report in the assembly in 1987, but its contents were never revealed, much less discussed for implementation. The BJP-led govt made the report public this week, 41 years after it was signed, sealed and delivered.Contrary to decades of narratives framing the disturbances of 1983 as communal, the Tewary report notes that any such interpretation would be ""a very superficial view"". It also points out that ""all sections of society suffered as a result of the senseless violence"" and that the victims ""were not confined to one religious, ethnic or linguistic group"".""Many perceptive witnesses have gone into this historical aspect and interpreted the disturbances as clashes of economic interests. In many cases, they arose out of land disputes,"" the former judge writes, describing illegal occupation of land by immigrants as ""one of the greatest irritants"" for the Assamese people.""Land has been the main attraction for illegal immigrants,"" the report says, seeking to drive home the point that fears of the indigenous population being overrun were ""not imaginary"".The report cites census figures and testimonies of responsible witnesses, including erstwhile British administrators and census commissioners ""who did not suffer either from pride or prejudice, nor had any personal or group interest in the matter"".Tewary notes in the 1984 report that ""ejectment of encroachment stopped in 1979"". He mentions that infiltrator detection and encroacher removal are ""inseparably linked"", suggesting that both must be carried out by a multi-disciplinary task force led by magistrates and backed by armed police rather than leaving the task to junior officials.The report warns that immovable property should not be transferred into the hands of non-Assamese, recommending ""reasonable restrictions"" even on Indian citizens from outside the state. ""While defining who is an Assamese for this purpose, a reference to the National Register of Citizens or a minimum period of domicile in Assam or/and such other conditions, as might be found reasonable, may be examined.""On immigrants, the report distinguishes between two categories - refugees fleeing persecution in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and those who migrated primarily in search of land and economic opportunities.""Those who have been victims of persecution deserve all sympathy and support which has been the consistent national policy. Some of them have already been admitted as Indian citizens and granted citizenship certificates. The remaining should be deemed to be the citizens of India,"" the report says.This distinction between migrants from Bangladesh is similar to what was outlined later in CAA.","Tribhuvan Prasad Tewary Commission made recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, defining ‘Assamese’ identity and safeguarding it.

‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Saturday unanimously elected Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as the opposition coalition’s leader in the Bihar assembly, a decision taken at the alliance's first meeting since its drubbing in the recent state polls.The meeting was convened by Yadav ahead of the five-day assembly session beginning Monday.RJD MLA Bhai Virendra told reporters, “Tejashwi Yadav has been elected leader of the Mahagathbandhan in the state legislature. Naturally, he will also lead our party in the assembly.”Congress MLC Samir Kumar Singh, a working president of the grand old party’s state unit, noted that the choice was unanimous. “We have sufficient numbers, and he (Tejashwi) will also be the Leader of the Opposition,” he remarked.The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats. The RJD-led alliance, which had won 110 seats against the NDA’s 125 in 2020, managed just 35 seats this time — 25 of them from the RJD.Singh added that members of both Houses voiced “concern” over how the elections were conducted. “These were anything but free and fair. The SIR, first carried out in Bihar, remains questionable. It’s no surprise there’s so much political friction in a state like West Bengal,” he observed.He further noted that the alliance would “continue to raise its voice inside the House on issues concerning the people and confront the BJP-led coalition if it backtracks on promises made during the elections.”","The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats.

Unseen Footage Of DC Attack: Guard’s Split-Second Move in DC Shooting Goes Viral





Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed that the suspect accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, DC, may have been radicalised after arriving in the United States and was inadequately vetted under the Biden administration. Noem made the comments during an interview on ABC News’ This Week with Jonathan Karl.The suspect, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is accused of opening fire on two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week. Lakanwal, an Afghan national who previously worked with the CIA during the US war in Afghanistan, arrived in the US in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum in April this year.Noem argued that the Biden administration had allowed Lakanwal into the country without proper screening. She claimed that all information used in his asylum process was gathered under the previous administration and that officials had “not done well” in vetting those brought in through the Afghan evacuation programme. She repeatedly described the suspect as “unvetted” and said responsibility for any oversight “lies with them.” According to Noem, vetting procedures have since been strengthened under President Trump.Noem also claimed that authorities believe Lakanwal “could have been radicalised in his home community and in his home state” after arriving in the US. She did not provide evidence or describe how this alleged radicalisation may have taken place.Current and former security officials have rejected the accusation that the Afghan evacuee population was brought in without proper screening. Those familiar with Operation Allies Welcome said evacuees were vetted using biometric and biographical checks.The investigation into the shooting is still ongoing, and officials have not publicly detailed what may have influenced the suspect’s actions. Noem’s remarks have placed renewed attention on vetting standards and how they are applied.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the comments during an interview on ABC News’ This Week with Jonathan Karl.

The group said he spent his final years looking for new ways to help people make their own choices about the end of life.“Right up to the end of his life, he continued to search for further ways to help people to exercise their right to freedom of choice and self-determination in their ‘final matters’ – and he often found them.”Dignitas said it would continue his work and run the association in the spirit he set, as an organisation focused on self-determination and freedom of choice.Assisted dying laws have changed widely since Dignitas began. France recently approved assisted dying for some people with terminal illnesses. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have also legalised assisted dying since 2015. In the US, it is allowed in 10 states.In the UK, the assisted dying bill is still being debated. MPs backed it in June, but it is now under scrutiny in the House of Lords.Minelli, a journalist who later became a lawyer, faced several legal battles over the years.He won cases in the Swiss supreme court and at the European Court of Human Rights.Dignitas said Minelli had a lasting impact on Swiss law, noting a 2011 European court ruling that supported a person’s right to choose how and when to end their life.Switzerland does not allow euthanasia, where another person gives a lethal drug. But assisted dying, where a person takes the final action themselves after expressing the wish to die, has been legal for decades.Dignitas, which has over 10,000 members, also accepts people from outside Switzerland. By 2024, it had assisted more than 4,000 deaths, including 571 people from the UK. About 1,900 Britons are members, among them is TV presenter and campaigner Esther Rantzen.In a 2023 interview with the Financial Times, Minelli said he was still working long hours at the age of 90 and believed assisted dying should be available to almost everyone.","Ludwig Minelli, who founded Dignitas in 1998, died on Saturday.

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: An 18-year-old woman in Nanded accused her father and brothers of murdering her 25-year-old boyfriend over their inter-caste relationship, and demanded they be awarded capital punishment. She also performed symbolic wedding rituals before the deceased youth's funeral rites on Friday evening.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Aanchal Mamilwad said her family violently opposed the relationship solely because Saksham Tate belonged to a Buddhist community, while her family identified as Hindu.""My father kept telling me to end the relationship because he was a Buddhist. He even offered to let me marry any other man of my choice — but not Saksham. They killed him brutally, but they lost. My lover won, even in death. I want my father and brothers to be hanged,"" she said crying uncontrollably. She added that the couple planned to marry in a month and had already begun informal preparations.According to police, Tate was allegedly called to the Juna Ganj locality on Thursday evening, where he was attacked by the girl's brothers Himesh and Sahil Mamilwad, her father Gajanan Mamilwad, and three others who fired gunshots at him and later smashed his head with a stone slab, killing him on the spot.The other accused have been identified as Jayashri Thakur, Somash Lakhe and Vedant. Police said all the accused have been arrested while a minor was produced before the child welfare committee, which remanded him to a correctional home.The police also added that both the accused and the victim are criminals on police records. Nanded sub divisional police office (SDPO) Prashant Shinde said, an FIR against the accused has been registered at the Itwara police station under sections 103, 61(2), 189, 190(1), 191(2), 191(3) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, sections 3(2)(v), 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and section 3/25 of the Indian Arms Act.Sources said Tate was recently released from jail, and Aanchal claimed that her family had been plotting to eliminate him for weeks. ""They were threatening him continuously. As soon as he came out of jail, they decided to finish him. They murdered him like an animal,"" she alleged.Eyewitnesses at the funeral said the atmosphere turned emotionally overwhelming when Aanchal entered the home where Tate's body was kept and broke down beside it. She reportedly applied haldi and kumkum as part of symbolic wedding rites, and relatives said Tate too was ceremonially applied turmeric in accordance with traditional rituals.Aanchal further said she had severed all ties with her family and would live permanently with Saksham's mother. ""I will stay with his mother for the rest of my life. They cannot separate us anymore,"" she said.Senior police officers said additional force had been deployed in the locality to avoid caste-based tensions. The investigation was ongoing to determine the exact sequence of events, recover the weapon used and examine whether more individuals were involved in the conspiracy.Police said they would also record Aanchal's detailed statement.","Aanchal Mamilwad, 18, accused her father and brothers of murdering her 25-year- old boyfriend over their inter-caste relationship.

This was just after the Lakanwal family came to the US in 2021 and had no place to live.The Creightons even started a fundraiser for the Afghan family and called them truly genuine and kind people.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio made it clear that the United States’ visa policy does not automatically entitle a student to a visa.Speaking in detail to Ben Shapiro, Rubio said, “No one. It’s not a constitutional right. It’s not guaranteed by law. Every day, consular officers deny visas for all kinds of reasons, suspicion of overstaying, criminal associations, whatever it may be. Visas are denied worldwide daily. No one is entitled to one.”Rubio explained that there is a common misconception that applicants are automatically allowed entry unless a reason to deny the visa is found. “That’s not true. The burden of proof is the other way around,” he said.Rubio weighed in on national security concerns, saying, if a student visa applicant openly supports terrorist organisations like Hamas, or anything that goes against the principles of American policies, they would likely be denied entry. “We probably wouldn’t let them in — and we shouldn’t,” Rubio added. He clarified that if such support becomes evident after someone has already entered the US, the visa should still be revoked, even though it may take extra formalities.“If we later discover information that would have led to denial in the first place, that’s grounds for revocation,” he said.Rubio focused on Trump's 'America First' stance in his brief explanation. “It’s not in the national interest, or our foreign policy or national security interest, to bring people onto our campuses who aren’t just studying but are also promoting or excusing terrorist organisations committed to violence and destruction.”The secretary concluded and reaffirmed that the government’s authority is supreme: “So we have the right to deny visas before entry and revoke them after entry if someone’s presence undermines our national security or interests. That’s exactly what we intend to do.”His comments come as US President Donald Trump took a softer stance on H1-B visas. In a Fox News interview earlier this month, the MAGA chief said that the United States lacks talent and needs foreign skilled workers from abroad to fill critical roles such as tech and defence. The conservative Republican base grew angry and accused Trump of betraying the GOP’s hardline immigration principles.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio made it clear that the United States’ visa policy does not automatically entitle a student to a visa.

'Red Fort To Kashmir’: Pak Leader's SHAMEFUL Comment on Delhi Blast; Terror a Badge of Honour?

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), along with Jammu and Kashmir police, on Monday carried out raids at eight locations in Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam districts of Kashmir in connection with the Delhi terror blast case, including a major search at the house of key suspect Jasir Bilal Wani.As per news agency PTI ,the operation is linked to what investigators describe as a “white collar terror” network, with multiple teams carrying out searches simultaneously.The raid at Wani’s house is currently underway.Jasir Bilal Wani, also known by the alias Danish, emerged as one of the key co-conspirators in the November 10 Red Fort car blast.A political science graduate from Qazigund in Anantnag district,. According to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Wani worked closely with Nabi — a 28-year-old doctor from Pulwama — in planning Hamas-style drone attacks and developing small, crude rockets for coordinated blasts.Investigators say Wani was the technical backbone of the module. He modified drones, upgraded their batteries and camera systems, and attempted to integrate small explosive payloads designed for deployment in crowded public areas.The designs, NIA says, closely mirrored tactics used by Hamas and ISIS in conflict zones across the Middle East.Wani met Nabi in October last year at a mosque in Kulgam, where he was allegedly drawn into the group. Initially, other operatives wanted him to serve as an over-ground worker for Jaish-e-Mohammed. But Nabi allegedly indoctrinated him into becoming a suicide bomber, pushing him toward a more radical role.By April 2025, Wani backed out, citing financial strain and religious prohibitions against suicide — though the NIA believes his involvement in technical preparations continued.His arrest follows the detention of another key associate, Amir Rashid Ali, in whose name the blast vehicle — an i20 — was registered. Ali allegedly arranged a safe house and provided logistical support to Nabi.","Jasir Bilal Wani, also known by the alias Danish, emerged as one of the key co- conspirators in the November 10 Red Fort car blast.

'How God made us': Oklahoma graduate assistant rejects idea of multiple genders; placed on leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-god-made-us-oklahoma-graduate-assistant-rejects-idea-of-multiple-genders-placed-on-leave/articleshow/125682932.cms,".





A graduate assistant at the University of Oklahoma has been placed on administrative leave after a student filed a discrimination complaint over a graded essay in a psychology course.The essay, written by student Samantha Fulnecky, repeatedly referenced the Bible while responding to an article on gender stereotypes in a course taught by a transgender instructor.The assignment asked students to discuss “how people are perceived based on societal expectations of gender.” In her essay, Fulnecky rejected the idea of multiple genders.“Society pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth,” Fulnecky wrote, as quoted by New York Post.Fulnecky said that gender roles are “how God made us,” and argued that belief in multiple genders harms children. She cited very little of the article she was meant to analyse, except a vague reference to teasing as a way of enforcing gender norms.The graduate assistant, Mel Curth, who uses “she/they” pronouns, gave Fulnecky a failing grade, noting that the essay relied on personal ideology rather than empirical evidence and failed to address the assignment prompt.Curth also said parts of the essay were “offensive,” particularly language describing a group of people as “demonic.”“To call an entire group of people ‘demonic’ is highly offensive, especially a minoritized population,” Curth wrote.Curth encouraged Fulnecky to bring more “perspective and empathy” to her work and suggested criticisms should follow the methods of empirical psychology.Another instructor for the course, Megan Waldron, supported the grade and added that she found it “concerning” that Fulnecky did not see bullying or teasing as harmful.“Your paper directly and harshly criticises your peers and their opinions, which are just as valuable as yours. Disagreeing with others is fine, but there is a respectful way to go about it,” Waldron added.In response to the complaint, the University of Oklahoma wrote on X that a “graduate student instructor” was placed on administrative leave while it probed a student’s allegations that she was illegally discriminated against “based on religious beliefs.”","Samantha Fulnecky, a student at the University of Oklahoma, wrote an essay rejecting the idea of multiple genders.

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch





When Zohran Mamdani , the mayor-elect, announced that he would retain New York City's police commissioner, Jessica S Tisch, it meant he would be holding onto one of the architects of the department's pervasive surveillance network.The network developed by Tisch, called the Domain Awareness System, is used to track crime and help identify suspects by synthesising vast amounts of data from video, license plate readers, audio gunshot detectors, 911 call logs, criminal histories, summonses, arrests, warrants and more. It stores feeds from thousands of cameras across the city that record New Yorkers. Law enforcement officials say it is a tool to help solve crimes and defuse terrorist threats. Civil libertarians see it as an unconstitutional panopticon. Now it belongs to Mamdani.The mayor-elect, whose views were shaped by the department's heavy-handed spying on Muslim communities after the 9/11 attacks, has made it clear that he is generally wary of police surveillance. During the Democratic mayoral primary, Mamdani sounded warnings, and in 2023 he co-wrote an opinion article for city & state promoting laws to prohibit the police from creating fake social media accounts.""With every 'friend' and 'follow' request you accept, you risk a covert cop invading your privacy,"" it said.But surveillance is not mentioned in Mamdani's 17-page public safety plan, which proposes a department of community safety that would have mental health teams respond to some 911 calls and would expand street-level programs to stop violence. The police department's surveillance system presents him with fundamental questions about privacy and civil liberties.Mamdani may soon find himself defending a system that many of his supporters abhor, said Kenneth Corey, a former chief of department who worked in the intelligence unit. ""Could you realistically expect to fight 21st-century crimes without using 21st-century tools?"" he said. ""It's one thing when you're standing on the outside. Then you get inside and see that things aren't quite what you thought that they were.""In a response to questions about his plans for police surveillance, a spokeswoman for Mamdani, Dora Pekec, said only that he ""looks forward to working closely with Commissioner Tisch to deliver both public safety and justice to New Yorkers and continue to ensure their constitutional rights are protected at every corner.""Elizabeth Glazer, founder of the urban policy think tank Vital City a former federal prosecutor, said that the daily challenges of keeping New Yorkers and the police safe may force Mamdani to reconsider his previous stances. ""He has to address some of the realities that the police department face in how to democratically police the city,"" Glazer said. ""I think there will be some serious conversations between the mayor-elect and Tisch - that some of the rhetoric of the past will be moderated in the actual activity that the police department has to conduct.

Arrest of Rahmanullah Lakanwal in DC shooting





A second Afghan national brought to the United States under Operation Allies Welcome was arrested on Saturday, only days after a separate case of a shooting in Washington DC.This latest arrest involves a man accused of posting a TikTok video that appeared to show him constructing a bomb and naming the Fort Worth area in Texas as his target, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).According to Fox News, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was taken into custody. Court records show he has been charged at the state level with making a terroristic threat.DHS confirmed that Alokozay entered the country through Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era resettlement effort launched after the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, when the Taliban took over. Alokozay was admitted on September 7, 2022, as a lawful permanent resident. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now issued a detainer following his arrest.Texas authorities worked with the FBI in a Joint Terrorism Task Force and detained Alokozay on Tuesday.His arrest came only one day before a separate shooting in Washington DC involving another Afghan named Rahmanullah Lakanwal.Lakanwal is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House, in which one died, and one remains in critical condition.Lakanwal also arrived in the US under Operation Allies Welcome. He lived in Washington state and, according to a Trump administration official, applied for asylum in December last year and received approval in April. Investigators said he had no known criminal history before the attack.Later, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that the Lakanwal had previously worked “with the US Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”These back-to-back incidents have raised questions about the Operation Allies Welcome.A report from the DHS Inspector General last year found serious data errors in the Biden-era programme, saying some arrivals were issued multiple identification numbers or had names recorded incorrectly. The review warned that such problems made it harder to track “biographic or criminal history data” and said DHS did not have a clear system to monitor when parole for evacuees expired.In the aftermath of the DC shooting, President Trump said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who entered the country during Biden’s presidency. The MAGA chief said the attack exposed “lax migration policies” and announced a sweeping freeze on immigration: all immigration requests from Afghan nationals have been suspended indefinitely. The US has also paused issuing visas to individuals travelling on Afghan passports.The POTUS also ordered a sweeping pause on immigration from “Third World countries,” a category that includes several nations in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This aligns with his hardline stance on foreigners, supported by his MAGA base.Earlier this month, Trump also signalled a softening stance on H1-B visas.",Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was arrested in Texas on Tuesday.

Walz Destroys Trump With Brutal MRI Comeback After President Targets Him With R-Word Insult





US president Donald Trump on Sunday said he is ready to release the results of the MRI scan he took in October.Speaking to reporters while flying back to Washington from Florida, Trump said, “If you want to have it released, I’ll release it.” He described the results as “perfect.”Trump further told reporters he has “no idea” which part of his body the MRI covered. “It was just an MRI,” he said. ""What part of the body? It wasn’t the brain because I took a cognitive test and I aced it.”The MRI was done during Trump’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in October.The debate over releasing the report began after Minnesota governor Tim Walz replied to Trump’s post saying, “Release the MRI results.” Trump had earlier used an offensive term for Walz while claiming that Somali immigrants were “taking over” Minnesota and criticising the governor for not acting.The White House has not explained why the MRI was done or which part of Trump’s body was scanned.

Russia Evacuates Citizens From Venezuela Ahead Of Potential US Attack Amid Maduro-Trump Tensions

Is Trump about to start a new war in Venezuela?





US president Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The comment came at a time when the US has sent major military assets to the Caribbean, adding to its tense standoff with Caracas.Reports said the call touched on a possible meeting or even amnesty terms if Maduro agreed to step down. Trump refused to give details. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly. It was a phone call,” he told reporters.The US government says its strikes target drug cartels, some of which it claims are linked to Maduro. Trump is also weighing possible strikes inside Venezuela.On Saturday, Trump said all airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered “closed in its entirety”. Maduro’s government accused him of issuing a “colonial threat” and attacking Venezuela’s sovereignty.Venezuela’s foreign ministry said Trump’s comments were a “hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act”. It also said US authorities had halted deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants, though more than 13,000 had been returned this year after negotiations.The US has carried out bomber flights near Venezuela and deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, adding to what officials describe as the largest US military presence in the region in decades.More than 80 people have been killed in US strikes on suspected drug-running boats since early September.Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties said they support congressional reviews of US military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific. This followed a Washington Post report claiming that defence secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill all crew members during a 2 September strike.Members of Congress said they did not know if the report was correct. Some Republicans expressed doubts, but agreed that attacking survivors of an initial strike raises serious legal concerns.“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.","Donald Trump confirms he spoke with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

White House ‘Terror Attack’: Shocking Details Emerge After Afghan ‘AMBUSHES’ National Guard

What is the ‘Zero Unit’?



Eight years on the frontlines



Entry through Operation Allies Welcome







Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, has been arrested in connection with a brazen daylight shooting in Washington, DC, just blocks away from the White House. In response to the shooting, the Trump administration announced a pause on all asylum decisions and a suspension of visa issuance for Afghan nationals.Lakanwal, who previously served with the US military and the CIA in Afghanistan, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and the wounding of Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, both West Virginia National Guardsmen deployed to the city as part of US President Donald Trump’s anti-crime initiative.An image of an identification badge circulating online appears to link the suspect to the “Kandahar Strike Force” or “03” unit, one of several “Zero Units” that operated alongside US and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan.However, little is publicly known about the unit or the nature of its operations.Lakanwal was among the thousands of Afghans who served alongside US forces during the nearly two-decade war against the Taliban.Lakanwal’s “03” unit, as identified on his badge, operated in and around Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province. Images of the badge circulating on social media after the attack also featured the words “Firebase Gecko”, the former CIA and US Special Forces base in the region, which once served as the compound of Taliban founder and Afghanistan’s first supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, as cited by The Time.These units operated as Afghan intelligence and paramilitary forces, supporting US troops throughout the long campaign against the Taliban. Trained by American special operations personnel, they conducted high-risk missions, including frequent night raids.Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused the units of carrying out extrajudicial killings, indiscriminate airstrikes, and multiple violations of international humanitarian law during the 2010s. Known for their covert operations, the units were described by diplomats as “death squads,” according to HRW.Both the CIA and the US government have rejected these allegations.Lt Gen Sami Sadat, former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, said that Lakanwal served in the “03” unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the US-backed government added that the “03” unit, also known as the Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), “was under the special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.” Sadat said Lakanwal was part of the unit’s operations team.“He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,” Sadat was quoted as saying by CBS News.Lakanwal’s family faced serious threats from the Taliban, prompting him to move them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the US, Sadat noted, Lakanwal “was generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.”As a member of a Zero Unit, Lakanwal would have been virtually guaranteed asylum in the US, as members of these elite forces were prime targets for Taliban retaliation after the group regained control. Many of these unit members also played crucial roles in the August 2021 evacuation from Kabul, securing guaranteed spots on flights out of Afghanistan for themselves and their families.A federal program established under former president Joe Biden is under scrutiny after officials confirmed that Lakanwal entered the US through it.Known as Operation Allies Welcome, the initiative was created to assist Afghans fleeing Taliban reprisals after Kabul’s fall in August 2021. Reports suggest the program had significant flaws, potentially allowing individuals to enter the country with minimal oversight, according to the New York Post.Under Operation Allies Welcome, later renamed Enduring Welcome, nearly 200,000 Afghans were admitted to the United States, with about 40 percent granted Special Immigrant Visas.The Department of Homeland Security’s archived page for the program states that all arrivals underwent a “rigorous screening and vetting process,” which was “multi-layered and ongoing,” involving checks by the DHS, Department of Defence, FBI, National Counterterrorism Center, and other agencies.","Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, has been arrested in connection with a brazen daylight shooting in Washington, DC, just blocks away from the White House.

'Used FBI Jet, But...': Kash Patel Under Fire Over Use Of FBI's Aircraft To Meet GF Alexis Wilkins

Patel pushes back at ‘smears’





FBI Director Kash Patel has pushed back against allegations that he misused a government-owned jet to travel to events linked to his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins . The claims, which surfaced after flight logs were circulated online, accuse Patel of taking taxpayer-funded flights to attend Wilkins’ performances while federal employees went unpaid during the recent government shutdown. “In a recent interview with The Epoch Times, Patel dismissed the accusations as politically motivated, saying the FBI has publicly released all flight records and that he uses the aircraft less than his predecessors.”The controversy began after former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin alleged on his podcast that Patel used the Bureau’s aircraft for personal trips, including travel to Wilkins’ wrestling and music events. The allegations gained traction as social media users and commentators highlighted flight-tracking data allegedly linked to Patel’s movements.In response, the FBI clarified that its director is prohibited from flying commercially for security reasons and must use Bureau aircraft for all official travel. Bureau officials also said Patel reimburses the government for any portions of trips deemed personal, as required under federal regulations.Patel reiterated this in his own statements, adding that he mandated the use of government airfields instead of Reagan National Airport — a change he says has saved taxpayers millions.The scrutiny widened after reports claimed Patel authorised FBI SWAT-qualified agents to provide security for Wilkins at public events. Critics argued that deploying such elite personnel for the protection of a director’s partner risked diverting resources from high-risk operations.Patel’s office countered that all security decisions were made by career agents based on credible threats to Wilkins’ safety, not personal preference, and stressed that the protocols followed were consistent with standard protective assessments.Reports also indicated that an FBI aviation official resigned after details of Patel’s flight logs were leaked, though the Bureau has not publicly confirmed the circumstances of the departure. Critics have pointed to the development as evidence of internal concern, while others argue it reflects the sensitivity of disclosing protected travel information involving the Bureau’s director.Patel has aggressively defended himself online, calling the allegations “fake news” and attacks by “internet anarchists” designed to undermine the FBI’s work. He criticised unnamed allies for failing to speak up in his defence, saying their silence “is louder than clickbait hate.” Supporters have framed the controversy as a politically charged effort to weaken Patel, while critics maintain that the episode highlights legitimate questions about judgement, oversight, and the use of federal resources at the agency’s highest levels.","FBI Director Kash Patel has pushed back against allegations that he misused a government-owned jet to travel to events linked to his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins.

New York's 'ICE Out' Street Standoff Explodes After DC National Guard Ambush | Clashes, Chaos On Cam





A social media influencer stirred controversy after distributing 18-inch machetes and bottles of alcohol to homeless people in several US cities. He says he intends to bring the stunt to New York City in January.Keith Castillo, 29, who goes by the handle “povwolfy,” posted videos on TikTok and Instagram over Thanksgiving showing him distributing the weapons and liquor in Austin, New Orleans, and Little Rock. One clip, featuring background music including Drake’s hit God’s Plan, has garnered over 14 million views. In the video, Castillo offers a machete to a man who responds: “Hell yeah, man.”The Corpus Christi native told the New York Post that he bought the stainless steel Gordon-brand machetes in bulk online for under $5 each and insisted the stunt was intended to “keep homeless folks safe.” He said he consulted local police in the cities he visited, who allegedly confirmed the actions were not illegal. Castillo also plans to distribute small bottles of 66-proof Cinnamon whisky in addition to the machetes in Las Vegas, Los Angeles’ Skid Row, and New York.Critics were quick to condemn the giveaway. An Instagram user commented: “Keeping them safe [no], making them dangerous [yes].” Retired NYPD Sergeant and John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Joseph Giacalone called the combination of alcohol and machetes a “cocktail for disaster,” though he noted that mere possession of a machete is not illegal.Castillo, however, defended his actions, saying the blades are intended as tools and denying any immoral intent. “Honestly I really don’t care bro, it’s good for the clicks and views, you know,” he told the NY Post.","Keith Castillo, 29, posted videos on TikTok and Instagram showing him distributing the weapons and liquor in Austin, New Orleans, and Little Rock.

Trump War Secy’s Heartfelt Tribute With US Troops For National Guard Trooper Killed By Ex-CIA Asset





US secretary of war Pete Hegseth has sharply rejected allegations that he illegally ordered troops to 'kill everybody' on an alleged 'narco-boat' targeted in a Caribbean missile strike, denouncing the reports as “fake news” and defending the Trump administration’s maritime campaign as both lawful and necessary.In a post on X on Saturday, Hegseth accused the report of waging a “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory” campaign, saying: “As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.” He added that the operations had always been described as “lethal, kinetic strikes,” with the stated aim of halting drug flows, destroying “narco-boats,” and killing “narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. ” “As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” Hegseth added.Hegseth also used the statement to contrast the Trump administration’s approach to border and narcotics enforcement with that of Joe Biden, claiming the previous government “preferred the kid gloves approach”.According to him, the current actions are “lawful under both U.S. and international law”, comply fully with the law of armed conflict, and have been approved by “the best military and civilian lawyers”. He said personnel in US Southern Command risked their lives daily and vowed: “I will ALWAYS have their back.”His remarks followed a Washington Post report alleging that, during a September 2 surveillance operation involving 11 people aboard a suspected narcotics vessel, Hegseth gave a spoken directive to “kill everybody”, as recounted by two people with direct knowledge of the mission. The Post reported that after an initial missile strike, two survivors were seen clinging to the debris; a second strike was then reportedly ordered to comply with the directive.According to The Guardian, that strike was the first of many in a sustained offensive that has killed more than 80 people and targeted at least 22 boats since September.USA Today has similarly reported that 83 people have been killed in at least 21 attacks. The Trump administration has argued that those on the vessels were drug traffickers linked to groups such as Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, which Washington has designated a terrorist organisation.However, both outlets note that no detailed public evidence has been provided, and some narcotics experts quoted by the Associated Press say many of those killed were neither “narco-terrorists” nor cartel leaders.Senate armed services committee leaders Roger Wicker and Jack Reed have announced an inquiry into the strikes, while lawmakers including Republicans and Democrats cited by USA Today have questioned whether the operations amount to unlawful or extrajudicial killings.",US secretary of war Pete Hegseth rejects claims he ordered troops to 'kill everybody' on an alleged 'narco-boat' targeted in a Caribbean missile strike.

New York's 'ICE Out' Street Standoff Explodes After DC National Guard Ambush | Clashes, Chaos On Cam





Heury Gomez, a 43-year-old Manhattan green card holder, was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on November 22 after more than three months of detention, reuniting with his 18-year-old disabled son just in time for Thanksgiving.Gomez is the sole caretaker of Noah, who suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, is nonverbal, cannot walk, and depends on a tracheostomy tube. He said his first priority after release was seeing his family and having a proper meal.“Noah was really happy. He was smiling and laughing a lot,” Gómez said in Spanish, as quoted by the New York Daily News. His cousin, Carolina Zapata, described the reunion as a “beautiful moment” that brought her to tears.Gómez had been detained at Newark International Airport on August 6 upon returning from a five-day birthday trip to Mexico City, which he took as a brief respite before starting intensive home medical training to care for Noah, according to CNN. He had been awarded full custody of his son a few months earlier and was preparing to devote himself to his care upon returning from the trip.Homeland Security officials cited prior convictions for two misdemeanours assault with intent to cause physical injury and petty larceny from nearly a decade ago as grounds for detention.Gómez served 20 days in jail, completed probation, and paid fines for the 2015 convictions, which Zapata said stemmed from a “petty argument” over an EBT card.The NY Daily News quoted Zapata saying, “This has been a traumatizing experience for him… it doesn’t erase the injustice and the scars left behind from this ordeal.””During a cancellation of removal hearing on November 12, a government attorney did not contest Gómez’s defence. Judge Ian Simons ordered his release from North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan, citing the “extraordinary hardship his son would face if he was deported,” Gómez’s lawyer, Brian Pu-Folkes, told the New York Daily News.While in detention, Gómez said he felt unsafe, sometimes lacked adequate food, and noted tensions among detainees. He and Zapata have since resumed the medical training necessary to bring Noah home to their Hell’s Kitchen apartment for round-the-clock care.According to CNN Gómez’s case reflects a broader expansion of immigration enforcement under US President Donald Trump, with green card holders and others facing removal proceedings even for minor or decade-old offences.","Heury Gomez, a 43-year-old Manhattan green card holder, was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on November 22.

"'Irresponsible, dangerous': FDA memo links Covid shots to children deaths; proposes new vaccine rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/irresponsible-dangerous-fda-memo-links-covid-shots-to-children-deaths-proposes-new-vaccine-rules/articleshow/125668221.cms,"Representative image (Photo credit: ANI)





Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr Vinay Prasad , told agency staff in a memo that at least ten children died ‘after and because of receiving’ the Covid-19 vaccine.The 3,000-word memo, obtained by NBC News, was authored by Dr Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. It claims that agency staff determined “no fewer than 10” of 96 child deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) between 2021 and 2024 were linked to Covid vaccines. Prasad suggested myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, as a possible cause but provided no supporting evidence.""For the first time, the US FDA will acknowledge that COVID-19 vaccines have killed American children. Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death. In many cases, such mandates were harmful. It is difficult to read cases where kids aged 7 to 16 may be dead as a result of covid vaccines"", he wrote.The memo did not detail the children’s ages, medical histories, timelines, or the vaccine manufacturer, and the findings have not been peer-reviewed.Dr Paul Offit, a paediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told NBC News: “This is sort of science by press release,” calling the memo “irresponsible” and “dangerous.”Dr Peter Marks, former FDA vaccine chief, criticised the agency’s handling of the data, saying the claims were drawn from what he described as the “anti-vaccine playbook.” Marks told The Guardian that the memo’s “clearly political tone” was alarming and noted that establishing causation in child deaths is complex. He added that VAERS is intended to detect early safety signals, not to confirm vaccine-related deaths.Dr Kathryn Edwards, professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University, said determining whether a vaccine caused death requires autopsies and careful review of other causes. She stressed that Covid itself has caused far more child deaths than those cited in the memo.Prasad’s memo also proposes sweeping changes to FDA vaccine evaluation, including revisiting flu shot assessments, requiring post-market proof of pneumonia vaccine effectiveness, and reconsidering co-administration of multiple vaccines. Experts warn these changes could slow approvals, delay product launches, and disrupt established immunisation schedules.The memo comes after the FDA and CDC limited Covid vaccine eligibility this winter to adults over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions.Previous research supports vaccine safety: a 2023 JAMA Pediatrics study of over 10 million children aged 5–11 found vaccination reduced infection and hospitalisation risk, while a 2024 Nature Communications study reported no rise in serious adverse events, noting only a very small risk of myocarditis in teen boys.","The 3,000-word memo, obtained by NBC News, was authored by Dr Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.
