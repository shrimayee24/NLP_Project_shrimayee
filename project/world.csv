BLA claims mass execution of 214 Pakistan train hijack hostages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bla-claims-mass-execution-of-214-pakistan-train-hijack-hostages/articleshow/119060439.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has issued a statement in connection with the train hijack incident, claiming responsibility for executing 214 hostages, alleging that Pakistan's refusal to negotiate led to their deaths. The BLA said the Pakistani forces ignored a 48-hour ultimatum for a prisoner exchange, resulting in the mass execution of only Pakistan security forces personnel.This is in sharp contrast to claims by the Pak army which claimed on Friday that 26 hostages were killed by the Baloch rebels who ambushed a train in Balochistan. The army acknowledged that only 18 of the slain hostages were army and paramilitary soldiers. However, this comes as no surprise, sources said, as ISI has been known to hide casualties on its side.In their statement, the BLA also acknowledged the death of 12 of its Mujahideen including five Fidayeen of the Majeed Brigade aka the suicide squad in the incident which it named as ""Operation Darra-e-Bolan "".The Baloch rebels accused the Pakistani military of attempting to misrepresent the situation and give details of its operation.""When the Zarar Company of Pakistani SSG commandos arrived to rescue the hostages locked in the bogies of the Jaffar Express, Fidayeen surrounded and attacked them fiercely. In this battle which lasted for several hours SSG commandos suffered heavy casualties while the hostages were also executed,"" the BLA said.","The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has issued a statement in connection with the train hijack incident, claiming responsibility for executing 214 hostages.

Accused denies drunk driving, claims innocence

Legal proceedings and further investigation

NEW DELHI: Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia , the 23-year-old prime accused in the fatal Vadodara car crash that claimed the life of a woman and left eight others injured, was brought back to the accident site for a crime scene recreation. In a video shared by ANI, Chaurasia appeared visibly uncomfortable, limping and clutching his ears as he was escorted by the police.The dramatic scene unfolded as investigators attempted to piece together the events of the early hours of March 14, when a speeding car driven by Chaurasia allegedly rammed into a two-wheeler. The impact proved fatal for one woman, while several others sustained serious injuries.Vadodara Police Commissioner Narasimha Komar disclosed new details, stating that more than three vehicles were linked to the incident, including two active vehicles and one electric vehicle (EV). While Chaurasia is currently in custody, police are scrutinizing all angles, including possible intoxication at the time of the crash.“We have registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, apart from invoking sections under the Motor Vehicle Acts. Our forensic teams are compiling physical and material evidence,"" the police said in a statement.Chaurasia, however, has refuted allegations of drunk driving. He claimed that he had attended a Holika Dahan celebration but did not consume alcohol or attend any post-event parties. According to him, he was driving at a speed of 50 km/h at the time of the crash.“I was not drunk. I went to the Holika Dahan event but did not drink or party. I want to meet the victim’s family and take responsibility for the accident,” Chaurasia reportedly told police.Authorities, however, are not taking his statement at face value. “Blood samples have been collected from Chaurasia and his co-passenger Pranshu Chauhan to determine whether alcohol or other intoxicants were involved. The investigation will proceed based on forensic findings,” Commissioner Komar said.Police continue to track the movements of the accused’s co-passenger and are in the process of recovering crucial digital and physical evidence from the scene. The forensic report will play a key role in determining whether Chaurasia was indeed sober at the time of the accident.With mounting evidence and a growing legal case, the Vadodara hit-and-run is quickly turning into a high-profile investigation. The next steps will depend on forensic reports and the police’s final charge sheet.","Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia, 23, is the prime accused in the fatal Vadodara car crash that claimed the life of a woman and left eight others injured.

He was driving the car,"" while pointing at Chaurasia. Chaurasia, a fourth-year law student at M.S. University, then stepped out of the car and began shouting ""another round,"" ""uncle,"" and ""Om Namah Shivay"" at the top of his voice.Passersby chased him down, preventing his escape.

BENGALURU: With the gold smuggling racket involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao getting murkier by the day as three central investigation agencies keep digging deeper, Karnataka government on Saturday ordered DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, her father, to go on 'compulsory leave'.Ranya was reportedly being escorted by a police constable deployed for protocol services extended to IPS officers when she was intercepted by DRI sleuths at Bengaluru airport while trying to smuggle in 14.2 kg gold from Dubai on March 3.

In the five-page letter, dated March 6, she alleged she was roughed up and threatened. ""I was apprehended from inside the aircraft and arrested without being given an opportunity to explain. From the time of my apprehension to being produced in court, I was hit and slapped on the face at least 10-15 times by officials whom I can identify. One of them said if I didn't sign the documents prepared by them, they would expose my father's name and identity, despite knowing he was not involved,"" the letter stated.Ranya further said owing to immense pressure and physical assault, she was forced to sign 50-60 typed pages and around 40 blank pages, and that no mahazar was ever conducted, unlike what was claimed. ""Some persons from Delhi, said to be officers, clearly wanted to shield some other passengers and falsely implicated me,"" her letter said.","Karnataka government orders DGP Ramachandra Rao, her father, to go on 'compulsory leave' Ranya was intercepted by DRI sleuths at Bengaluru airport while trying to smuggle in 14.2 kg gold from Dubai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119059425,imgsize-741756,width-400,resizemode-4/119059425.jpg"

No injuries were reported.The attack follows a series of similar explosions in Punjab's border areas.

SpaceX launched a fresh crew to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday night, setting the stage for Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.The new team—Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov—blasted off from Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX capsule as part of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program. Their arrival, expected late Saturday, will allow them to replace the existing crew, including Williams, Wilmore, Nasa’s Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The transition will enable Wilmore and Williams to hand over operations before their scheduled departure next week, pending weather conditions.Wilmore and Williams originally launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner capsule in June for what was meant to be a short test mission. However, technical issues, including helium leaks and thruster failures, forced Nasa to delay their return, eventually deciding to bring them back on a SpaceX mission. Their homecoming was further postponed due to battery repairs on a new SpaceX capsule, prompting the agency to use a refurbished one to speed up the process.During their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams continued ISS maintenance, including fixing a toilet, watering plants, and conducting experiments. Williams also set a record for the most spacewalking time by a female astronaut.The delay became politically charged when President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed the previous administration had stalled the astronauts' return. However, Wilmore and Williams have consistently backed Nasa’s decision-making.With their return now imminent, both astronauts expressed excitement about reuniting with their families. Wilmore, a church elder, looks forward to resuming in-person ministry, while Williams is eager to walk her Labrador retrievers.“We appreciate all the love and support from everybody,” Williams said earlier this week. “This mission has brought a little attention … but I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we’re doing” with space exploration.","Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.

At least 21 people were killed after US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Houthi-held areas in Yemen, reported news agency AFP.Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.The aerial strikes against the Yemeni rebel group came after Trump vowed to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" in the back of the Houthis' operations in the Red Sea.The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January amid the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict.Before the strike Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective"", citing the Houthis' threats to Red Sea shipping.The Houthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes ""will not pass without response"".""This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,"" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television.Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran ""axis of resistance"" groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa.The US has conducted multiple strikes on Houthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Houthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory.Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. ""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" he said.""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"" he added.The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, are a Zaidi Shia rebel group from northern Yemen, primarily based in Saada province. They emerged in the 1990s as a religious-political movement opposing Saudi-backed Sunni influence and Western interference in Yemen.The group was founded by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004 by Yemeni government forces, triggering an ongoing conflict. Though Zaidi Shia Islam is distinct from the Twelver Shia Islam of Iran, the Houthis have received military and financial support from Iran, leading to accusations that they serve as an Iranian proxy.The group gained global attention in 2014 when they took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile and sparking a war with the Saudi-led coalition in 2015. Since then, they have engaged in missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and recently, international shipping vessels in the Red Sea.Their attacks, particularly on Israel-linked ships, have drawn US and UK airstrikes in retaliation. The Houthis claim these actions are in support of Palestine, but their increasing aggression in the region has led to fears of wider conflict.Currently, they control much of northern Yemen, running a parallel government while continuing their fight against Yemeni government forces, Saudi Arabia, and UAE-backed militias.The Houthis primarily receive support from Iran, which provides them with weapons, military training, and financial assistance. Iran sees the Houthis as a useful ally in its broader strategy to counter Saudi Arabia and expand its influence in the region. The Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed group, has also reportedly provided military training and strategic guidance to the Houthis.In addition to Iran and Hezbollah, the Houthis have received support from various local tribes in Yemen, particularly those opposed to Saudi influence. Some reports suggest that North Korea has also secretly supplied them with weapons, though this is less confirmed.The Houthis claim to be fighting against Western imperialism, and in recent conflicts, they have aligned themselves with the Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"", which includes groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and various militias in Iraq and Syria.The Houthis have carried out several major attacks, disrupting global security and trade. In September 2019, they launched drone and missile strikes on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halving Saudi oil production. In January 2022, they attacked Abu Dhabi with drones and missiles, killing three people and targeting an oil facility and the international airport.Throughout 2021-2022, they launched ballistic missiles at Saudi cities, including a strike on a Jeddah oil depot during a Formula 1 race. Since late 2023, they have attacked Red Sea shipping, claiming to target Israel-linked vessels, leading to US and UK airstrikes on Houthi positions.In November 2023, they hijacked the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked ship, escalating tensions further. Their increasing use of advanced drones and missiles has turned them into a key regional threat.","Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday. The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119062835,imgsize-4890408,width-400,resizemode-4/119062835.jpg"

The administration plans to move around 300 alleged gang members to detention facilities in El Salvador, raising human rights concerns. Broader immigration crackdown: This move signals Trump’s intent to aggressively pursue stricter immigration policies, potentially setting the stage for broader crackdowns in a second term.

President Donald Trump on Saturday, invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, claiming the US was facing an invasion by a Venezuelan gang. The law, originally meant for wartime, gives the president broad powers, allowing him to speed up mass deportations of undocumented immigrants—potentially escalating his immigration crackdown.The declaration specifically addresses Tren de Aragua , which Trump alleges is operating as a hostile entity under Venezuelan government direction.""Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,"" Trump's statement read, the Associated Press reported.""The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,"" it added.This came the same day, a federal judge in Washington prohibited the administration from deporting five Venezuelans under the anticipated order, indicating potential legal challenges ahead.The federal judge's intervention to prevent the deportation of five Venezuelans using the Alien Enemies Act sparked immediate legal confrontations, even before the president's formal announcement.Trump had previously indicated his intention to utilise the 1798 Act, which was last implemented during World War 2 to authorise Japanese-American civilian internment.The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward submitted an urgent lawsuit in Washington's federal court. They argued that the order would classify Tren de Aragua as a ""predatory incursion"" by a foreign government, potentially leading to indiscriminate deportation of Venezuelans.DC Circuit Chief Judge James E Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order, valid for 14 days, to protect five Venezuelans in immigration custody who were believed to face imminent deportation under the act.Boasberg implemented the order to maintain current circumstances and scheduled a subsequent hearing to consider extending protection to all Venezuelans in the United States.The Trump administration subsequently challenged the initial restraining order, arguing that preventing presidential action before its announcement would severely restrict executive branch operations.The Justice Department's appeal warned that allowing such orders could enable district courts to obstruct crucial national security actions upon receiving complaints. They suggested this could affect operations like drone strikes, intelligence activities, or terrorist apprehensions, urging the court to prevent such precedent.The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, is a law designed for use during wartime or when the US faces an imminent threat of invasion by a foreign nation.The act grants the President the authority to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during periods of conflict, particularly targeting recent immigrants who could be perceived as aligning with US adversaries.According to CNN, legal experts argue that invoking the act outside of wartime—such as citing threats from gangs or cartels—would be legally challenging unless the US is under direct attack by a foreign government.The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history, each during wartime, as noted by the Brennan Center. During World War I and World War II, it was used to detain and deport German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, and Japanese immigrants.The act also played a role in the forced internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, a controversial chapter in US history.","The President can detain or deport any male over the age of 14 from an enemy nation if deemed a potential threat.

AHMEDABAD: Authorities on Saturday demolished ""illegally constructed"" houses of six of 14 accused arrested for attacking commuters and rioting in the Vastral area of the city, police said.Fourteen persons, one of them a minor, were apprehended after a mob attacked some passersby with sticks and swords, leaving three injured and as many vehicles damaged, inspector S B Chaudhari of Ramol police station said.Ramol Police arrested 14 accused, including a juvenile, for their involvement in the incident following a complaint lodged by Alap Soni, a resident of the area. A mob of 20 men armed with sticks, swords and knives created terror by vandalising vehicles and beating up people in Vastral on Thursday night.Chaudhari said the houses of six of the arrested accused were found to be constructed illegally and were demolished in the Amraiwadi and Khokhar localities.Family members of the accused created a ruckus, but the police brought them under control and prevented them from hindering the demolition work.Soni, in his complaint, stated that he and his family were celebrating his parents' marriage anniversary. ""Around 9pm, I along with my uncle Kashyapbhai and other family members left in a car to for CTM,"" he stated in the complaint.The complainant stated that while they were passing through Nirant Crossroads, a group of about 20 people armed with sticks, swords, and pipes blocked their car and attacked them. They were stopping passersby and damaging vehicles with their weapons.""We got out of the car to plead with them not to damage our vehicle. However, the group attacked us, threatening to kill us if we resisted. A person stabbed me in the back and on my right hand, while my uncle was hit on the head with a pipe,"" he stated in the FIR.""The FIR has been lodged against Pankaj, Khatu, Govind, Ashil, Vishesh, Ravi, Mayur, Shyam and 12 others,"" said a police official.Bystanders gathered around, but the attackers continued shouting and causing damage. ""They later fled on two-wheelers, leaving us injured,"" said Soni.Purported videos of police publicly flogging some of these accused also surfaced. Later, another video went viral where the 13 accused were paraded in the area, and they were seen pleading and demanding an apology for the incident.On Thursday, a video purportedly of the group attacking passersby and a car also went viral.Krunal Desai, assistant commissioner of police I-Division, said, ""While we were checking their details, it was established that six of the 13 accused were staying in illegally constructed houses. The report was sent to the corporation, and a corporation team, based on the report, carried out the demolition.""The cops registered a case under BNS section 109(1) (attempt to murder), 118(1) (voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 189(2) (unlawful assembly), 189(4) (unlawful assembly being armed with deadly weapons), 190 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 191(2) (rioting), 191(3) (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 126(2) (wrongful restraint), 324(6) (mischief), 351(3) (criminal intimidation) among others.Cops said that the attack on Thursday night was to establish supremacy in the area by two gangs operating in the area. ""The gang members were roaming in the area to target members of the rival gang,"" said a senior police official. ""During this time, the group gathered and moved towards Mahadev Nagar Nirant Crossroads, vandalising vehicles and attacking anyone in their path. The accused caused chaos by throwing stones and brandishing swords, assaulting passersby while hurling abusive language at them,"" the official added.","Authorities on Saturday demolished ""illegally constructed"" houses of six of 14 accused arrested for attacking commuters and rioting.

Belgrade Serbia Protests: Serbia sees one of the largest anti-government protests over President Aleksandar Vucic’s 11-year rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-serbia-sees-one-of-the-largest-anti-government-protests-over-president-aleksandar-vucics-11-year-rule/articleshow/119062964.cms,".

A huge protest took place in Belgrade, marking the peak of more than four months of student-led demonstrations against President Aleksandar Vučić . It is the biggest challenge to his 11-year rule, which is accused of becoming increasingly autocratic.Hundreds of Vučić supporters, many dressed in black with matching backpacks, gathered in Pionirski Park, near the Serbian parliament. Local reports suggest that among them were members of organised football hooligan groups and veterans of the Red Berets, a special forces unit linked to the 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjić.A large police presence separated the two groups. Near the state broadcasting headquarters, officers warned protesters to move, citing threats of an attack by pro-government groups.The protests began on 1 November after a newly renovated railway station in Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people. The incident exposed corruption and unsafe construction in a Chinese-led project, sparking public anger. The government was accused of covering up the disaster. Since then, students have led the movement, demanding honest governance and functional state institutions without corruption. They refuse to align with opposition parties, which they blame for enabling Serbia’s failing public sector.Ahead of the rally, Vučić escalated tensions, claiming that foreign intelligence agencies were behind an attempted coup.Vučić has also sought favour from Donald Trump. A Trump hotel is planned for Belgrade, and last week, Vučić gave an interview with Trump’s son, Don Jr. The younger Trump repeated the Serbian government’s claims that the protests were influenced by foreign money, calling them a “weaponised” movement aimed at causing a revolution.Authorities took steps that appeared aimed at limiting the protest’s size. Intercity trains were cancelled, officially for ""passenger safety,"" and some public transport services were suspended. But that didn’t stop people from coming. Convoys of cars, waving national flags and banners, flooded into Belgrade from all over Serbia. Farmers joined in with tractors, and hundreds of bikers rode into the city together, showing their support.The European Union and United Nations urged the Serbian government to respect the right to protest. Western governments have been cautious in addressing the demonstrations, as they seek to maintain ties with Vučić, hoping to pull him away from Russia’s influence.","Hundreds of Vučić supporters gathered in Pionirski Park, near the Serbian parliament.

Missouri tornadoes: Threat of tornadoes and wildfires wreak havoc leaving at least 17 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-monster-storm-threat-of-tornadoes-and-wildfires-wreak-havoc-leaving-at-least-17-dead/articleshow/119053825.cms,"'It's the worst I've ever seen'



Cross-country storm brings tornado threats, fire conditions to multiple states

'Electricity off for an unknown period of time'



Severe weather systems, high-risk alerts



Southern Plains fire emergency



Weather service announced blizzard warnings



Tornadoes tore through parts of the US, leaving a trail of destruction as powerful storms moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday. At least 17 people have died, with Missouri experiencing the highest toll, as officials confirmed 11 fatalities from overnight twisters.The Missouri State Highway Patrol confirmed multiple injuries alongside the fatalities. ""It was unrecognisable as a home. Just a debris field,"" said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived, according to the Associated Press.""The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls,"" he added.According to Akers, rescuers successfully saved a woman from the residence. Officials in Arkansas reported three death in Independence County and 29 injuries across eight counties following overnight storms.""We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,"" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a post on X. Both Sanders and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency.The severe weather system brought destructive winds to the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday. The Missouri State Highway Patrol reported two adult deaths in Bakersfield, Ozark County, with multiple injuries.Coroner Jim Akers reported one death early Saturday after a tornado destroyed a home approximately 177 kilometres east of Bakersfield. These casualties occurred as a substantial weather system crossed the country, generating winds that caused fatal dust storms and intensified over 100 wildfires.Severe weather conditions, including hurricane-force winds, were expected to affect regions inhabited by more than 100 million people. Forecasts predicted winds reaching 130 kph from Canada to Texas, bringing blizzard conditions to northern regions and increased wildfire risks to southern areas.Three people lost their lives on Friday in vehicular accidents during an Amarillo County dust storm in Texas, according to Sgt Cindy Barkley. One incident involved approximately 38 vehicles.""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" Barkley said, describing the near-zero visibility as a nightmare. ""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled,"" he added.Cave City, Arkansas reported five injuries, prompting Mayor Jonas Anderson to declare a state of emergency early Saturday. ""Electricity infrastructure has been decimated and will remain off for an unknown period of time,"" he said.Oklahoma authorities ordered evacuations in certain areas as over 130 fires were reported statewide. The State Patrol noted winds strong enough to overturn several lorries, the Associated Press reported.Weather specialists noted that March typically experiences such extreme conditions. ""What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,"" said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre in Norman, Oklahoma.""And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area,"" he added.The Storm Prediction Centre issued warnings about rapidly moving storms capable of producing tornadoes and large hailstones comparable to baseballs. The primary concern centred on straight-line winds, potentially reaching hurricane strength with speeds up to 160 kph.High-risk alerts were issued for Mississippi regions, including Jackson and Hattiesburg, alongside Alabama areas encompassing Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The severe weather system threatened eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle with potential storms and tornadoes.Multiple wildfires emerged across the Southern Plains amidst dry conditions and powerful winds. Authorities ordered evacuations in various communities across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.In Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, a fire expanded dramatically from 2 square kilometres to approximately 85 square kilometres, according to the Texas A&M University Forest Service on X.Emergency crews contained its progression by evening. Another fire, situated 90 kilometres southward, spread to 10 square kilometres before containment.Strong winds disrupted power supply to over 2,60,000 homes and businesses across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, as reported by poweroutage.us.The National Weather Service announced blizzard warnings for specific areas in western Minnesota and eastern South Dakota, effective early Saturday. Expected snowfall ranged between 7.6 to 15.2 centimetres, with possibilities of reaching 30 centimetres.Forecasts indicated wind speeds reaching 97 kph, likely to create whiteout conditions.","At least 17 people have died, with Missouri experiencing the highest toll, as officials confirmed 11 fatalities from overnight twisters.

Who is Ranjani Srinivasan?



The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced that an Indian doctoral student from Columbia University , whose visa was revoked for allegedly supporting Hamas , has voluntarily left the United States. The student, Ranjani Srinivasan , used the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11, 2025, after the Department of State cancelled her visa on March 5 due to security concerns.Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem confirmed the self-deportation and issued a statement saying, “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home App to self-deport.”Srinivasan’s case comes amid increased scrutiny of foreign students in the US following pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. Another Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested by ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers in Newark for overstaying her F-1 student visa, which had expired on January 26, 2022. Kordia had previously been arrested in April 2024 for participating in pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University.Also read: Who is Ranjani Srinivasan? Why did the US revoke the Indian scholar's visa? The DHS has not released further details about Srinivasan’s alleged activities but confirmed that video footage of her departure using the CBP Home App had been obtained.Ranjani Srinivasan is an Indian national who was pursuing a doctoral degree in Urban Planning at Columbia University. A Fulbright recipient, she holds an M.Phil in Urban Planning from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP), a Master’s in Design from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design, and a Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) from CEPT University in India.According to Srinivasan’s bio on NYU Wagner’s official website, her research focuses on “the evolving nature of land-labour relations in peri-urban statutory towns in India,” with broader interests in “the political economy of development, the spatial politics of land, and the sociology of labour.”The US government has not disclosed additional details regarding the specific reasons behind the visa revocation beyond allegations of supporting Hamas.","Ranjani Srinivasan used the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11, 2025.

Returns from Lebanon; detained

'She's being treated like a terrorist'



Family and friends of a Rhode Island physician have alleged authorities wanted to deport her at all costs, after her plane was allowed to depart even as a federal court issued a directive aimed at preventing her immediate deportation from the United States.The order was issued on Friday. At the same time, an aircraft with Dr. Rasha Alaweih waited on the tarmac at Boston's Logan International Airport, and was given permission to take-off.""They (authorities) did not do anything to stop the plane. So, clearly, they wanted to deport her regardless of if there was a judge's order or not. She didn't do anything wrong,"" Dr. Basma Merhi, a family friend and associate of the deported physician, told The Providence Journal.For six years, Alawieh had pursued studies and work in the US, and since July 2024, she had been employed at Brown Medicine's Division of Kidney Disease & Hypertension in Rhode Island.There, she used to assess potential transplant candidates and monitored their post-procedure progress, according to Dr. George Bayliss, the transplant division's medical director.At Boston's Logan airport, customs officials detained Alawieh, 34, on Thursday as she returned after a fortnight-long family visit to Lebanon, according to family friend Merhi and solicitor Thomas Brown, who manages immigration and visa matters for Brown Medicine-affiliated doctors.Brown indicated that Alawieh was travelling on a recently obtained H-1B visa from the American consulate in Lebanon.The H-1B classification is a temporary permit enabling employers to sponsor highly-qualified foreign professionals for 'specialty occupations.'Brown stated that the visa authorised Alaweih stay through mid-2027.He mentioned that during Alawieh's airport detention, a minor visa application issue came up, but had been 'relatively easy' to resolve.""They did issue the visa, so whatever is going on is not the consequence of the actions at the American consulate, as far as I know. She was clear to return. She had the visa, she had the right passport. Everything was looking good,"" he said.The following day, Alawieh's supporters acted swiftly to halt her deportation, with Yara Chehab, her cousin, submitting a complaint in US District Court, Massachusetts, against the Department of Homeland Security and the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.Chebab's complaint accused federal authorities of 'unlawful' detention of her cousin and not allowing attorneys to talk to Alaweih.""Despite repeated requests from Dr. Alawieh's family members and a volunteer attorney, CBP refuses to provide any justification for their detention, refuses to allow the attorneys to talk to Dr. Alawieh, and refuses to provide assurances that Dr. Alawieh will not be deported to Lebanon,"" the complaint stated.Later that day, US District Judge Leo Sorokin passed an order preventing Alawieh from leaving Massachusetts without 48 hours' notice to allow court consideration.The timing of the order's receipt by immigration officials remains uncertain. CBP Ryan Brissette did not respond to enquiries in this regard.Alawieh is currently in detention at the Paris airport and has a flight to Lebanon on Sunday, her family friend said.""Alaweih received a brief phone call upon landing in Paris and contacted her mother with reassurances. She is being treated like a terrorist. It is ridiculous. She is an accomplished doctor and treats patients. And she is following all the rules. She is not doing anything wrong. And her Visa is valid,"" the friend added.","Dr. Rasha Alawieh, 34, was detained at Boston's Logan airport on Thursday.

Trump's 18th century law for speedy deportations blocked by district judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-18th-century-law-for-speedy-deportations-blocked-by-district-judge/articleshow/119063973.cms,"Legal challenges for Trump

A federal judge gave a huge blow to the Trump administration’s deportation of Venezuelan gang members from the country, blocking the use of a centuries-old law to fast-track the crackdown.US district judge James E Boasberg issued the emergency ruling on Saturday evening, just hours after President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify immediate deportations. The law, which has historically only been used during wartime, would have allowed the administration to bypass standard immigration proceedings.Boasberg intervened after learning that the government had already begun flying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador and Honduras under the order. El Salvador had agreed earlier in the week to accept up to 300 migrants deemed gang members by US authoritiesss.“I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” Boasberg said in court. He added, “a brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm.”The ruling came shortly after the president’s claim that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was mounting an ""invasion"" of the United States, posing a direct national security threat. His proclamation, issued just over an hour before the hearing, described the country as a “hybrid criminal state” that had lost control to transnational crime syndicates, including Tren de Aragua.The order, if enforced, would have given the administration unprecedented power to remove individuals it identified as gang members without court review. It also threatened to strip certain legal protections normally available to those facing deportation.The administration’s move triggered legal challenges, as the ACLU and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan migrants who feared imminent deportation.In response, Boasberg issued a temporary order on Saturday morning to halt their removal. The government appealed, arguing that preventing a president from acting before an order is even publicly announced would paralyse executive power.The justice department appealed that if the order were allowed to stand, ""district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint.”Boasberg later expanded his ruling to cover all migrants affected by Trump’s order, pausing deportations for up to 14 days and scheduling a follow-up hearing on Friday.During the hearing, deputy assistant attorney general Drew Ensign defended the order, arguing that Trump had the authority to use the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua. He also referred a 1948 Supreme Court decision that allowed the US to continue holding a German national as an enemy alien years after World War II had ended.Tren de Aragua originated in a Venezuelan prison and expanded across South America as millions fled economic collapse in the country. While Trump made the gang a focus point of his immigration policy, formally designating it as a terrorist organisation last month, Venezuelan authorities claim that the group has been dismantled.","US district judge James E Boasberg issued the emergency ruling on Saturday evening, just hours after President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify immediate deportations.

'Germany will kill itself': Europe at risk of 'engaging in civilisational suicide' warns JD Vance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/germany-will-kill-itself-europe-at-risk-of-engaging-in-civilisational-suicide-warns-jd-vance/articleshow/119058866.cms,"Europe is ‘At Risk’ of ‘Engaging in Civilizational Suicide’: A Dire Warning from JD Vance

US Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks “civilisational suicide” if it fails to tighten border controls , further stating that, “If migrants come from other countries who are incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself.”“Too many countries are unable or unwilling to control their borders,” said Vance during a Thursday interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle with host Laura Ingraham, highlighting the increasing challenges European nations face in managing migration.He further expressed concern about European authorities limiting citizens' freedom of expression, particularly when they protest against immigration-related issues stating that: ""Europe is threatened with civilisational suicide. They are either unable or unwilling to control their borders. What we're seeing now, their attempts to resist that, that's good, that's the right thing to do.""“But you also see them beginning to restrict the free speech of their own citizens, even as those citizens protest things like invasions across borders. [It was such protests] that led to the election of Donald Trump and a number of European leaders,” Vance added.The Vice President also voiced serious concerns regarding Europe's immigration policies and increasing restrictions on citizens' rights, describing it as a critical issue for the continent's future.“If you have a country like Germany and billions migrants come from other countries that are totally culturally incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself,” he said,“I hope that doesn’t happen, as I love Germany and want it to thrive,” he added.The situation Vance discusses originated in autumn 2015, when the EU experienced a substantial increase in refugees and unauthorised immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA) data shows that Germany received 25% of all EU asylum applications in the first half of 2024.Vance further reaffirmed the administration's commitment to enforcing Trump's immigration policies, emphasising its dedication to stricter border control measures.He reported significant achievements in border security, citing a reduction exceeding 95% in border crossings since Trump's January inauguration. With border matters largely addressed, the administration is now prioritising deportations, stating ""We're building that capacity up.""Vance criticised former President Biden's administration for inadequate funding of detention facilities and weakening Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), creating operational challenges for Trump's team.He commended Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and ""border czar"" Tom Homan for implementing voluntary departure initiatives.“We’re going to encourage a lot of people to self-deport. We don’t have to knock on your door. Before that happens, why don’t you get on a plane and go home yourself?” Vance added.","US Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks ‘civilisational suicide’ if it fails to tighten border controls. “Too many countries are unable or unwilling to control their borders,” said Vance during a Thursday interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119059574,imgsize-411529,width-400,resizemode-4/119059574.jpg"

The Trump administration on Friday withdrew lawsuits filed by the Biden-era Department of Justice (DOJ) against Iowa and Oklahoma over their immigration laws. These laws made it a state crime for anyone to remain in the state if they were in the US illegally.Republican leaders in Iowa and Oklahoma argued that their states had to take action because the Biden administration had failed to control the southern border. Their laws allowed state and local officials to arrest people with outstanding deportation orders or those previously denied entry into the US. The laws were modeled after a similar measure in Texas.The Biden administration sued Texas, Iowa, and Oklahoma, claiming that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. Texas’ law was briefly in effect before being halted by a federal court, while the Iowa and Oklahoma laws had been on hold pending legal review.Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond welcomed the dismissal, blaming the Biden administration for failing on border security. ""The White House's negligence made our state law necessary,"" Drummond said.Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird called the decision a ""major victory"" for Iowa. ""President Trump once again proved he has Iowa’s back by dropping Biden’s ridiculous lawsuit,"" she said.Despite the DOJ’s withdrawal, immigrant rights groups continue to fight the Iowa law. The Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice filed a lawsuit against the state, but a recent federal appeals court ruling complicated their case. The court argued that the Biden administration’s lawsuit against Iowa had made the separate immigrant rights lawsuit moot.Rita Bettis Austen of the ACLU of Iowa vowed to keep fighting the law. ""We remain committed to preventing this harmful law from taking effect,"" she said.Trump campaigned on a promise to tighten immigration laws and deport those in the US illegally.

When they arrived at an abandoned ranch outside La Estanzuela, a small rural village outside Guadalajara, they discovered three underground cremation ovens, burned human remains, hundreds of bone shards and discarded personal items, and figurines of Santa Muerte - the Holy Death.The Mexican authorities, who were notified of the grisly discovery, said in several statements that they later found 96 shell casings of various calibers and metal gripping rings at the ranch. By last Friday, the discovery was dominating local newspapers and TV reports, and the search group was referring to the site as an ""extermination camp.""It is unclear how many people died on the site, and none of remains have been identified. The authorities have yet to say who operated the camp, what crimes were committed there and for how long. But this week, the attorney general's office took over the investigation at the request of President Claudia Sheinbaum.Photos taken by authorities and by the volunteer group, Searching Warriors of Jalisco, at the abandoned ranch showed over 200 shoes piled together and heaps of other personal items: a blue summer dress, a small pink backpack, notebooks, pieces of underwear. The more than 700 personal items were a chilling hint about the number of people who may have died there.In a country seemingly inured to episodes of brutal violence from drug cartels, where clandestine graves emerge every month, the images shocked Mexicans and prompted outraged human rights groups to demand that the govt put an end to the violence.Over 120,000 people have been forcibly disappeared in Mexico since record-keeping began in 1962. Human rights groups and collectives of volunteers in search of missing relatives have warned that the number could be higher.The discovery at the ranch comes at a time where Sheinbaum faces intense pressure from President Donald Trump to crack down on organised crime. Partly because of his threats, Sheinbaum has shifted security issues back to centrestage on her agenda. But her govt faces significant challenges. One of the most violent criminal organisations in Mexico, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel , which emerged in the early 2010s, is now a major producer and trafficker of synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl and methamphetamine. The group, which operates in the state of Jalisco and across the country, has diversified into other criminal activities like illegal logging, human trafficking and extortion.","Volunteers searching for missing relatives find mass grave in western Mexico.

We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,” he said, further adding that, “The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt.”The Houthis reported multiple explosions in their territory, with images online showing plumes of black smoke over the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a military facility.

Trump Cuts Voice Of America Funding: Trump signs order to cut staff at Voice of America and other US-funded media organizations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-to-cut-staff-at-voice-of-america-and-other-us-funded-media-organizations/articleshow/119053023.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming as the president continued his campaign to restructure government without congressional approval.On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the US Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.On Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and US Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior advisor to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.The agency also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia.Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend US power and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.The latest reductions are especially provocative because the Agency for Global Media is an independent agency chartered by Congress, which passed a law in 2020 limiting the power of the agency's presidentially appointed executives. Trump has already taken several moves to gut congressionally-mandated programs, setting up a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of presidential power.Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.The Trump administration has already made several controversial moves regarding Voice of America, including suspending a respected journalist who noted criticism of Trump and canceling contracts with outside news organizations, including the Associated Press.","The US Agency for Global Media houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

The bomber first shot police personnel at the mosque’s entrance before detonating himself inside the hall where a large congregation was offering Friday prayers, reported Dawn.Security officials in South Waziristan have begun examining the blast site to determine who was responsible for planting the IED inside the mosque. While no group has claimed responsibility yet, authorities remain concerned about the rising attacks on religious places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","A bomb explosion during Friday prayers at a mosque in South Waziristan injured four worshippers, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem.
