Ginza Vualzong, the organisation's secretary of information and publicity, clarified that a recent appeal to residents of Kangpokpi to cooperate with central security forces was only meant to ensure no fingers were pointed at them for anything untoward occurring on that stretch.KZC said the appeal shouldn't be interpreted as a call for unrestricted movement across buffer zones separating Meitei and Kuki-Zo territories, the two communities involved in the ethnic conflict that flared up in April 2023.Vualzong said it was solely the Union govt's responsibility to keep NH-2 safe for traffic by deploying ""neutral"" central forces.The response came soon after the MHA hailed what it termed a ""significant decision"" by KZC to reopen the highway.The ministry's statement mentioned that the breakthrough was the outcome of a series of meetings in Delhi with the Kuki leadership over the past few days to get them to lift the blockade.On MHA stressing on ""free movement"" of civilian and goods traffic on NH-2, the Kuki leadership said it the community wasn't accountable beyond cooperating with forces deployed for security.

The ""Axis of Upheaval""

A 'Multipolar' world?

Trump’s provocative response

A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media. The image, showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing and exchanging pleasantries, has been hailed as a symbol of a rapidly shifting global order, one that some are now calling a ""new world order"" dominated by Asia.Captured in Tianjin, the photograph depicts three of the most powerful figures in the world today standing shoulder to shoulder, sending a clear message about the growing unity among countries that have faced increasing tensions with the United States.The image, taken during the summit's final moments, has sparked significant commentary from US political analysts, with some expressing alarm over the growing influence of a multi-polar world and the decline of American dominance.US political commentator Van Jones, speaking on CNN, did not mince words when analyzing the significance of the image. “That image of Xi Jinping with Putin, with Modi, with the leader of Iran, and the leader of North Korea, should send a chill down the spine of every American,” he said. Jones warned that the photograph marked a pivotal moment in global relations, suggesting that the traditional US-centric order was under threat.“We’re going to look back on today historically as a very big deal,” Jones continued, adding that the formation of this grouping signified that ""the West is now in a box."" He argued that the US is now ""on the bad end of the triangle"" as global powers realign themselves, particularly those who have found themselves on the receiving end of US tariffs and foreign policy pressures.Jones's reaction echoes a broader anxiety within the US media regarding the rise of non-Western powers, and the perceived collapse of traditional alliances that have long underpinned US influence. In the wake of the photograph's circulation, many commentators in Washington warned that this increasingly multipolar world could leave America increasingly isolated.The timing of the summit, and the leaders’ visible camaraderie, has fueled concerns among US analysts about the formation of a bloc of countries that could challenge American dominance.The Washington Post was quick to label the gathering as the first formal meeting of an ""anti-American axis of upheaval,"" with the leaders of Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia at the helm. This grouping, the paper argued, represents a new coalition of powers that is actively resisting US influence in global affairs.The New York Times also took note of the significance of the photograph, suggesting that the bond between Xi and Putin, both of whom have long been at odds with Washington, was now central to a broader challenge to the US-led world order.The article highlighted that PM Modi’s presence underscored India’s growing diplomatic pivot toward these countries, even in the face of unresolved border disputes with China.As US media dissected the photograph, many commentators, including Jones, drew attention to what they saw as the emergence of a new “multipolar” world.The idea of a multipolar world suggests a global order with multiple power centers, challenging the traditional dominance of the United States and its allies. At the SCO summit, President Xi emphasized the need for countries to reject Cold War thinking, warning against rival power blocs and bullying.Xi's call for a more just and balanced global governance system struck a chord with those critical of US hegemony. The Chinese president's message resonated with many at the summit, who viewed it as a direct rebuke to the West's attempts to impose its values on other regions. “We need to reject the law of the jungle, where the strong prey on the weak,” Xi stated, signaling a firm stance against what he and others see as Western coercion.For many in the US, these remarks reinforced the notion that Washington’s influence was waning. The growing cooperation between China, Russia, and India, despite their differences, has been interpreted as a direct response to what they view as America's increasingly unilateral approach to global affairs.The US reaction to the SCO summit was not limited to political analysts and commentators. US President Donald Trump, never shy about expressing his views on global affairs, took to his social media platform Truth Social to comment on the summit's outcome. Trump’s post, which sarcastically wished President Xi and his counterparts a “great and lasting day of celebration,” reflected his deep concern about the growing solidarity between these leaders.""Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,"" Trump wrote, reflecting his view that the gathering represented a collective challenge to US interests.","A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media.

Neighbours had told her even digital records must be ""updated"". Only after officials assured her that Asif's certificate was valid did she leave.Khatun's anxiety mirrors a wave of panic sweeping Murshidabad and beyond in Bengal. For two weeks now, villagers have been lining up from before dawn until late evening to supplement manual certificates with digital ones, fearing Bengal could face a Bihar-style revision of voter rolls before the 2026 assembly polls. In Bihar, lakhs of names vanished - a purge echoing across Bengal's villages, especially among minorities.The panic driven by rumours and social media has two more triggers: dread of a possible NRC count that could strip citizenship if documents don't match, and reports of migrant workers from Bengal being expelled as ""Bangladeshis"" for lack of papers. Parents don't want their children to become collateral during crackdowns on illegal immigrants.Numbers tell the story. Till mid-Aug, Behrampore issued 50-60 digital certificates daily. Now demand is 10-20 times higher. On Sept 2 alone, staff handed out 1,000. Lines still snaked outside.Municipal chairperson Naru Gopal Mukherjee said the rush has overwhelmed the office. Twenty extra staff and camps have been deployed ""but the crowd is relentless"". Nearly 98% of applicants are from minority families, more than 99% from rural areas.Many arrive before sunrise. Sahabuddin Biswas of Durlavpur village set out at 3.30am, reaching the counter by 5.30. ""I have two daughters. The elder has a Madhyamik admit card, authentic proof. I am worried about my younger daughter, Tuhina. She has only a manual certificate. If SIR or NRC happens, she must be safe.""Farmer Asibur Rahaman came with his son and daughter after hearing ""manual certificates could be scrapped"". Safikul Islam, a teacher from Basantapur, said: ""Even driving licences are digital now. I wanted my children's certificates updated for the future.""Jyotsna Bibi of Dadpur worried mismatched surnames could create trouble. ""Our children's certificates say their father's surname is Ali. But on his documents, the surname is Sheikh.""Registrar of births and deaths Partha Sarathi Roy said the surge has pushed staff beyond capacity. ""We are unable to convince people that if anyone has an errorless certificate - even if it is manual - it is not mandatory to make them digital. We are ready to provide them in emergency cases like passport or job verification.""But the rush has spread. In Lalbag, Murshidabad municipality chairperson Indrajit Dhar reported a 30% spike in applications. ""Crowd for digital birth certificates has increased due to the SIR/NRC panic. Even the subdivision hospital counter is feeling it,"" he said.Officials insist the fears are baseless. ""There is no govt order that manual certificates are invalid. People may apply for digital ones, but it should not be fuelled by rumours or anxiety,"" district magistrate Rajarshi Mitra said.

Jaishankar Urges Stronger India-EU Ties As Trump’s Tariffs Shake Global Strategic Landscape

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said predictability has a huge premium in global politics, a remark made as India looks to readjust its relations with China while manoeuvring through US tariffs.The foreign minister also said the world is witnessing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. ""Changes we see in the world today do influence our policy and do influence the manner we approach other countries,"" he said.Speaking at a press briefing with German counterpart Johann Wadephul, Jaishankar further said: ""We are seeing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape.

He said that Russia has ""not been willing"" to sit down at the negotiating table despite ""enormous efforts"" by Trump.""We have right from the outset been pursuing a policy that has the objective of Russia and Ukraine following the path of negotiations. However, what we have noticed of late is that despite the enormous efforts that the American president has invested, Russia has not been willing to sit down at the negotiating table, whereas the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed his immediate readiness to negotiate and sit down at the negotiation table,"" the German foreign minister said.He further said that Ukraine has been attacked ""without having done anything"" to trigger the Russian attack, while choosing to skip Moscow's apprehension of Kyiv joining the US-led Nato alliance, which is argued as a key reason Russian President Putin decided to invade Ukraine.""In a way, it has taken a first step. We're talking about a country that has been attacked without having done anything to trigger that attack. The only demand is that weapons fall silent. No more than that... The German approach and the European approach are that we want to do whatever we can to make President Putin sit down at the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said.On Friday, Jaishankar said India should not be ""unfairly targeted"" in the context of the Ukraine war, as New Delhi continues to face pressure over its oil trade with Russia.""Had a telecon today with Finnish Foreign Minister,"" Jaishankar posted on X. ""Our discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and its ramifications. India should not be unfairly targeted in that context. We have always advocated dialogue and diplomacy.""The remarks come as India is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the United States for purchasing Russian oil. The US administration has accused New Delhi of ""funding the war"" by continuing trade with Moscow.India has strongly criticised Washington’s decision, calling the tariffs ""unjustified and unreasonable"". The Trump administration recently raised duties on Indian goods to over 50 per cent as a penalty for India’s oil imports from Russia.Last week in Moscow, Jaishankar defended India’s position during a joint press briefing with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.

Poll Should local authorities improve drainage systems to prevent future flooding? Yes, it is essential. No, it's not a priority.





NEW DELHI: Water swallowed Jharoda Kalan and parts of Gitanjali Colony in southwest Delhi, turning what were once narrow village lanes into swirling, muddy rivers. People took shelter on a nearby flyover, from where they recorded videos of what were once their homes.Jharoda Kalan, a village near the Delhi-Haryana border, is known for its agricultural fields and traditional settlements but has seen rapid urbanization and is, therefore, a mix of old and developing Delhi. It houses the Delhi Police Training College and is linked by rural roads, along which Gitanjali Colony got deluged.SEE ALSO: Delhi-NCR Rains Live Updates In the lanes, bolting the doors proved useless as torrents of brown water smashed through courtyards and climbed the walls inch by inch. Families stumbled out, the water reaching beyond their knees, mothers balancing toddlers on one hip while carrying sacks of clothes and utensils on the other. ""Paani bahut zyada hai,"" was the painful plaint everywhere.Further afield, Mungeshpur was in particular distress. ""This isn't rainwater. This is the water of negligence,"" muttered an angry Shivnath, 35, who waded to safety with his children on Tuesday night.""The Mungeshpur drain broke on Haryana's side, but nobody repaired it in time. By afternoon, the water had reached our waist; by evening, it was up to our chest. We left everything behind and ran.""The breach, caused by pressure from the Yamuna, was reported on Tuesday afternoon. By nightfall, the lowest-lying areas were submerged in 8ft of water. The colony, home to around 5,000 people, saw some 2,000 residents affected and displaced. By Wednesday, a municipal school nearby had been converted into a shelter. On the classroom floors, mats were spread out like patchwork; bags, wet clothes and pots lined the corners. Volunteers moved through the crowd distributing puri-sabzi and bottled water.Municipal officials clarified that they had initiated rescue operations after flooding was reported in an unauthorised colony adjacent to Urban Extension Road II. ""By evening 3,000 people had been shifted to the relief camp in a school. We have also made preparations at two community halls to accommodate more people,"" an MCD official said.Rinku Devi, who shifted here with her family of five, fought back tears. ""There was so much water we couldn't think of anything except getting out of the house. All our furniture, clothes and utensils are gone,"" she mumbled. Her neighbour, Abhay, summed up the loss bitterly: ""Poora grihasti kharaab ho gaya."" Standing beside him, Shanti added, ""It wasn't just the drain breaking. The potholes accumulated water too. This is civic negligence as much as nature. ""Local municipal councillor Amit Kharkhari said officials responded as soon as the breach was reported. ""We evacuated people and set up the relief camp within hours. We are in touch with the Haryana govt, but the water flow is very heavy. Containing it will take time,"" he said.""The damaged portion of Mungeshpur drain is being repaired under the supervision of Nasib Kumar, the sub-divisional magistrate of Bahadurgarh. The State Disaster Relief Force and the irrigation departments of Haryana and Delhi are also involved,"" said Swapnil Ravindra Patil, deputy commissioner, Jhajjar. ""The repair work is now complete. Currently, work to strengthen the drain is going on.""The MCD official confirmed this. ""There was flooding in Mungeshpur after leakage in the drain on the Haryana side and municipal staff extended all support to the authorities there until the drain was repaired,"" the official said.Back in Jharoda Kalan, on the bigger street, tractors stood like floating lifeboats, loaded with important items ripped from the homes in great hurry. Police stood in the ankle-deep swirling water, trying to keep order. Boats of the National Disaster Response Force sliced through the lanes to reach families trapped on terraces. In one boat, a rescued pet dog sat placidly amid the chaos. Another struggle - the painstaking rebuilding of lives washed away overnight - will only begin once the waters recede.","Jharoda Kalan, a village near the Delhi-Haryana border, is known for its agricultural fields and traditional settlements.

Marco Rubio Makes Big Charge Against Venezuela As Trump Orders War On Drug Cartels

‘It won’t stop with just this strike’

Maduro deploys troops in response





Defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday issued a stern warning after a US military strike destroyed a Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean, killing 11 suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang.“It's a new day. It's a different day, and… this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said on Fox & Friends.He described the operation as a direct hit against a “narco-terrorist organization” seeking to “poison” the United States with illicit drugs.“We knew exactly who was in that boat. We know exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented,” he said.Hegseth stressed that the action was carried out with “precision” and said more operations will follow. “It won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters, who we know is a designated narco-terrorist, will face the same fate, and it's important for the American people to protect our homeland and protect our hemisphere,” he said.Venezuelan minister of communication and information Freddy Nanez dismissed video of the fiery explosion as AI-generated, but Hegseth rejected the claim.“I can tell you that was definitely not artificial intelligence. I watched it live,” he said, as qupted by Fox News.US President Donald Trump confirmed the attack early Wednesday, releasing footage of the explosion and calling it a warning to cartels.“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.He added, “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America.”Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responded to the strike by deploying troops along the coast and border with Colombia, while urging citizens to join a civilian militia.Maduro has long argued that the US exaggerates Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to push for regime change. He and other officials have pointed to a United Nations report suggesting only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine moves through Venezuelan territory.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth issued a stern warning after a US military strike destroyed a Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean. “It's a new day.

‘Offering her something to keep her quiet’: Pro-MAGA activist drops bombshell video; exposes Trump DOJ official’s claims on Maxwell’s prison move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/offering-her-something-to-keep-her-quiet-pro-maga-activist-drops-bombshell-video-exposes-trump-doj-officials-claims-on-maxwells-prison-move/articleshow/123706477.cms,"A surprising allegation

DOJ's response: A denial of knowledge

Maxwell’s controversial move

A personal connection?





James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas and a prominent figure in conservative media, dropped a bombshell on Thursday with the release of a video clip that’s raising eyebrows across the political spectrum.The video features an off-the-record conversation with Joseph Schnitt, an acting deputy chief in the US Department of Justice, in which he discusses the transfer of Ghislaine Maxwell - woman at the heart of Epstein’s dark web - to a minimum-security prison and raises allegations of possible “special treatment” to keep her quiet.The conversation took place in an undercover setting, with a woman questioning Schnitt about his thoughts on the infamous Epstein files and Maxwell’s highly controversial transfer, Mediaite reported.Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in connection with financier Jeffrey Epstein, has remained a lightning rod for conspiracy theories and political backlash.The video begins with a question about the Epstein files, which have long been shrouded in secrecy. The woman in the clip asks, ""But those files do exist?"" to which Schnitt confirms, saying that ""thousands and thousands"" of pages are involved, with a significant number of them expected to be redacted.But it’s what Schnitt says next that sent shockwaves through both the political and media landscapes.He claims, ""I think they visited that Maxwell person. Kind of also involved… Transferred to a minimum-security prison too recently, which is against BOP policy because she’s a convicted sex offender. They’re offering her something to keep her quiet.""The bombshell comment sent O’Keefe into action, sharing the tape with his audience and explaining that Schnitt’s remarks reveal troubling inconsistencies and raise questions about Maxwell’s treatment by the Department of Justice (DOJ). O'Keefe then doubled down, discussing Schnitt's position as an acting deputy chief within the DOJ and the potential implications of his statements regarding the handling of the Epstein files, reported Mediaite.""That was the acting deputy chief of the Office of Enforcement Operations, Joseph Schnitt, telling a stranger about the FBI and DOJ’s handling of the Epstein files,"" O’Keefe remarked. ""It’s a rare glimpse into how some high-ranking officials might view the situation—and it raises significant concerns about transparency and accountability.""In a statement provided to Project Veritas, the DOJ swiftly responded to the video, asserting that Schnitt had no involvement in the department’s internal review of the Epstein materials. ""Joseph Schnitt has confirmed as much to leadership,"" the statement read, adding that his comments were based solely on ""what he learned in the media"" and were ""not reflective of the DOJ’s review process.""The DOJ continued, clarifying that the remarks Schnitt made about Maxwell’s treatment and the handling of the Epstein files were ""baseless"" and ""had absolutely zero bearing on reality."" They also noted that the department remains committed to transparency and is fully complying with requests for documents from the House Oversight Committee.Despite the DOJ's denial, O’Keefe and his supporters argue that the video sheds light on a potential cover-up, with O’Keefe further alleging that Maxwell’s move from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security facility in Texas could be part of a larger effort to suppress crucial information.Maxwell’s recent transfer has already been a source of considerable controversy. She was moved to a federal prison camp in Texas, which is known for offering more lenient conditions compared to high-security facilities.Critics have pointed to the fact that the transfer came shortly after a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney. This connection has only fueled conspiracy theories, particularly among those who believe that the Trump administration may have been trying to distance itself from the fallout of the Epstein scandal.Following the move, Democrats were quick to accuse the DOJ of witness tampering. In a letter to the department, House Democrats raised alarms, writing, “These actions raise substantial concerns that the Administration may now be attempting to tamper with a crucial witness, conceal President Trump’s relationship with convicted sex offenders, and coax Maxwell into providing false or misleading testimony in order to protect the President. ”Adding another layer of intrigue, the DOJ issued an email purportedly from Schnitt, claiming that he met the woman in the video on a dating app and that he was unaware of Maxwell’s transfer. The email further stated that Schnitt’s remarks about the Epstein files were entirely based on public reports and that he had no personal knowledge of the situation.This new development has led to even more questions, with some critics alleging that the DOJ's response might be an attempt to downplay the significance of Schnitt’s comments.","James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, released a video of an off-the- record conversation with Joseph Schnitt, an acting deputy chief in the US Department of Justice.

Destiny Jones’s early life and professional background

A relationship built on privacy and longevity

Las Vegas Raiders star receiver Amari Cooper has been rumored to be dating Destiny Jones, and fans and the media are starting to pay attention. The affair has slowly trickled into the public sphere over the past several years, providing insight into Jones's remarkable past and the seemingly long-standing relationship between the two individuals, which is said to date back to a time in Cooper's career when he was much younger.Originating from Westland, Michigan, Destiny De Monica Jones has continually had a love for dance. National championships followed, then a tenure with the Stingettes, the prestigious Alabama State University dance squad, where she was also president of Pinky Promise, a faith-based empowerment group. She also founded My Sisters Keepsake, a program in Montgomery, Alabama, that helped young women contribute to their communities by working with organizations such as the Salvation Army.Jones was determined in her studies, earning her undergraduate degree in psychiatry at ASU, before going on to get her Master′s in Marriage and Family Counseling from Holy Names University. Afterwards, she started her career as a therapist with the Family Service Counseling and Community Resource Center in San Francisco. In addition, she is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.Also Read: Mitch Marner faces backlash after Criticism of Toronto Maple Leafs fans Amari Cooper and Destiny Jones have maintained a surprisingly low-key relationship despite both of them having public profiles.There are hints that their relationship has deep roots, with Jones seen by Cooper’s side during the 2015 NFL Draft as he celebrated being selected fourth overall.Also adding to the intrigue, neither has yet publicly announced the relationship on social media, nor gone “Instagram-official. The two were so happy to make such glowing comments about each other despite that lack of public exposure; it just goes to show that both mother and son would rather have their private life be just that, private, even as Cooper’s NFL career transitioned from the Raiders to the Cowboys to the Browns and, now, the Bills.While their relationship has been kept very out of the public eye, fans are meeting on forums and social media to work out what they do know, and the conclusion they seem to have made is that while their relationship life are private, it's not completely invisible.","Amari Cooper and Destiny Jones have been rumored to be dating for several years.

"Mumbai don-turned neta Gawli walks free after 17 years, wants to reunite with family",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mumbai-don-turned-neta-gawli-walks-free-after-17-years-wants-to-reunite-with-family/articleshow/123684521.cms,"



NAGPUR: Notorious Mumbai don-turned-neta Arun Gawli also called ‘Daddy' stepped out of Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday after Supreme Court granted him bail in the 2007 murder case of Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar. After serving over 17 years in a high-security cell, including nine-and-half years in Nagpur Central Jail, the 76-year-old gangster shared a poignant wish with a senior jailor to reconnect with his family and play with his grandchildren, a stark contrast to his fearsome reputation in Mumbai's criminal underbelly.Gawli confided to one of the senior prison officials, his voice heavy with regret, that he missed watching his children grow and now wanted to spend time grandchildren. The emotional confession revealed a softer side of a man, who once ruled Dagdi Chawl in Byculla, offering a glimpse into his longing to reclaim a life lost to incarceration.The release was steeped in drama with Nagpur Police and prison guards orchestrating a fortified security to ensure Gawli's safe exit. Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) personnel and various intelligence units were present to pick up concealed clues.Dodging a throng of media waiting at the jail gates, Gawli was whisked away to Nagpur airport under heavy escort, arriving three hours early for his Mumbai-bound flight.Intelligence sources cited ongoing threats from Dawood Ibrahim 's D-Company, a feud rooted in the violent gang wars of the Eighties and Nineties, as the reason for his cautious departure. Surveillance was ramped up with police videographing the scene.Gawli's conviction in 2012 for Jamsandekar's murder, under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), marked a significant blow to his empire. Sentenced to life, he challenged the Bombay High Court's 2019 ruling upholding his conviction. On August 28, the Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his age and the 17 years already served, pending his appeal.Inside Nagpur Central Jail, Gawli was a model prisoner, adhering to protocols and earning commendations for discipline. He was granted 14–15 paroles and furloughs without incident. ""We recalled seeing Gawli spending time with religious scriptures,"" said a senior prison official. In 2018, he grabbed headlines by taking an exam on Gandhian philosophy, scoring 74 out of 80 marks, earning a certificate and khadi clothes — a surprising twist for a man synonymous with Mumbai's underworld.Gawli's release sparked speculation about his next move. Once a formidable figure who transitioned from crime to politics, serving as an MLA from Chinchpokli (2004–2009) under his Akhil Bharatiya Sena, Gawli's legacy is a complex tapestry of power, crime, and redemption. As he returns to Mumbai, questions swirl about whether ‘Daddy' will revive his political ambitions or embrace the quiet family life he craves.With security concerns looming, particularly from D-Company, his homecoming is anything but ordinary. Mumbai watches closely as the aging don steps into an uncertain future, balancing personal dreams with a past that refuses to fade.","Arun Gawli, 76, was released from Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","Donald Trump says Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday laughed off wild social media speculation about his health, and even his supposed death, after several days away from the cameras.The 79-year-old Republican, famous for his love of publicity, had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.The unusual silence, paired with his age and recent images showing a bruised hand and swollen ankles, sent rumor mills into overdrive. Some users on X even claimed the White House was hiding his death.“I didn’t see that,” Trump said when Fox News’ Peter Doocy jokingly asked him, “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Trump smirked, replying: “That’s fake news. I didn’t do anything for two days and they say, ‘there must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn’t do anything for months…”The White House has previously addressed Trump’s health concerns.In July, officials said discoloration on his hand came from “tissue irritation from frequent handshaking” and aspirin use for cardiovascular care.His swollen ankles were linked to chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition caused by weakened leg veins. His physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, reassured in a letter that Trump “remains in excellent health.”Trump has long bragged about his stamina, even once sharing a meme portraying himself as Superman. But with the two oldest presidents in US history, Biden at 82 when he left office and Trump now 79, health rumors are under heavier scrutiny than ever.","The 79-year-old Republican had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.

Trump TAKES A SWIPE at Biden’s Stumbles; Troops Burst Out Laughing During Visit





US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Public approval stood at 49% for Joe Biden in August 2021, 36% for Donald Trump in August 2017, 53% for Barack Obama in August 2009, and 56% for George W Bush in August 2001. The highest in the list was George HW Bush, who recorded a massive 69% in August 1989.Public opinion has also been negative on key policy areas. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 38% of Americans supported his move to deploy the National Guard in Washington, while 46% opposed it. His immigration policies had 43% approval, and only 37% supported his handling of the economy.Trade has been another sticking point.

Maduro Warns Trump: ‘Rubio Leading U.S. To Bloodbath’ In Venezuela Power Showdown

Venezuelan government responds







President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs. Trump alleged the gang was controlled by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.""Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, while sharing footage of the attack.""The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” he said.The strike is part of broader US counter-narcotics efforts to strengthen maritime operations off Venezuela and combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. While thousands of US personnel are being deployed, officials have not indicated any plans for a land incursion into Venezuela.“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump added.Earlier on Wednesday while speaking at the Oval Office, Trump described the operation as part of ongoing counter-narcotics efforts in the southern Caribbean.“The US forces shot out a boat… a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat,” he said. “So we took it out.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio also addressed the operation on X, calling it a lethal strike and noting that the vessel was operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organisation.” Rubio made the comments shortly before departing for Mexico and Ecuador to discuss drug cartels, regional security, and trade issues.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro responded by deploying troops along the coast and the border with Colombia and urged citizens to join a civilian militia. Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the US is exaggerating Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to remove him from power.He and other government officials have cited a United Nations report indicating that traffickers move only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine through Venezuela.On Monday, Maduro told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean.The Venezuelan government’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s announcement, and the Pentagon also declined to provide a statement.The latest UN World Drug Report shows that South American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, reported increased cocaine seizures in 2022 compared with 2021, but Venezuela is not highlighted as a central hub of trafficking.","US President Donald Trump announced that US forces killed 11 ""narcoterrorists"" while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs.

A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles.

Exposed: What Detainees Are Saying from Inside Trump’s ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ Detention Disaster

Judge blocks order to close 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention facility





A federal appeals court on Thursday allowed Florida’s immigration detention centre in the Everglades 'Alligator Alcatraz' to stay open, reversing a lower court order that had blocked new detainees and ordered the site to be dismantled.The 11th US circuit court of appeals in Atlanta granted state and federal authorities’ request to pause last month’s ruling by a Miami judge that had halted operations at the centre.Florida opened the facility in July, becoming the first state to run an immigration detention centre, a role usually handled by the federal government. The department of homeland security told the court it was not running the site.The appeals judges said the lower court had misapplied environmental law. They ruled that the national environmental policy Act did not cover the project because Florida had fully funded and operated it. Even if the federal government reimbursed costs later, it would not qualify as a federal project.Governor Ron DeSantis welcomed the decision, saying the detention centre was “open for business.” Environmental groups opposing the project vowed to continue their legal challenge, calling it harmful to the Everglades ecosystem.","Florida opened the facility in July, becoming the first state to run an immigration detention centre.

Chinese cyberattackers may've stolen data from almost every American,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinese-cyberattackers-mayve-stolen-data-from-almost-every-american/articleshow/123708878.cms,"



China has hacked into American power grids and companies for decades, stealing sensitive files and intellectual property such as chip designs.But a sweeping cyberattack by a group known as Salt Typhoon is China's most ambitious yet, experts and officials have concluded after a year of investigation. It targeted more than 80 countries and may have stolen information from nearly every American, officials said. They see it as evidence that China's capabilities rival those of the US and its allies.The attack was a years- long, coordinated assault that infiltrated major telecommunications firms and others, investigators said in a joint statement last week. The range of the attack was far greater than originally understood, and officials warned that the stolen data could allow Chinese intelligence services to exploit global communication networks to track targets including politicians, spies and activists.Hackers sponsored by the Chinese govt ""are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, govt, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure networks,"" the statement said.British and American officials have described the attack as ""unrestrained"" and ""indiscriminate"". Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain were also signatories to the statement, which was part of a name-and-shame effort directed at the Chinese govt.""I can't imagine any American was spared given the breadth of the campaign,"" said Cynthia Kaiser, a former top official in FBI's cyber division who oversaw investigations into the hacking. It was unclear whether the Salt Typhoon hack was intended to store ordinary people's data or if that data was incidentally swept up in the attack. But its scope was broader than previous hacks, in which China more narrowly targeted Westerners working on security or other sensitive govt issues, Kaiser said.The Salt Typhoon hack could signal a new era of Chinese cyber capabilities that will test its strategic rivals, including the US, security experts said. It highlights China's ambitions for global influence, which were on display on Wednesday at an elaborate military parade in Beijing.The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to a message seeking comment. The statement from Western allies gave the fullest accounting yet of what FBI has called China's ""cyberespionage campaign"".Investigators linked the Salt Typhoon attack to at least three China-based technology companies that have been operating since at least 2019, but the operation was uncovered only last year.The hackers' goal was to give Chinese officials the ""capability to identify and track their targets' communications and movements around the world,"" the statement said.Among the targets were phones used by prominent politicians, including President Donald Trump and Vice-President J D Vance, during their campaign last year. The effort also took aim at Democrats.The attackers stole data from telecommunications and internet service companies, penetrating more than half a dozen US telecommunications companies alone. The hackers were able to listen in on telephone conversations and read unencrypted text messages, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has said.It is not clear how Western countries have responded to Salt Typhoon. nyt","Salt Typhoon targeted more than 80 countries and may have stolen information from nearly every American, officials say.

Cuomo's call for five debates





NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has thrown down a challenge to US President Donald Trump , daring him to face off in a televised debate amid escalating tensions in the mayoral race.The Democratic Socialist candidate issued the dare after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged him on Thursday to take part in five debates, one in each borough.“Let’s cut out the middle man,” Mamdani told The New York Post. “Why should I debate Donald Trump’s puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?”Mamdani, who defeated Cuomo in June’s Democratic primary, accused Trump of trying to interfere in the mayoral contest, citing reported phone conversations between them. He insisted Trump should defend his record directly.“If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he’s cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,” Mamdani said..Cuomo, still a strong contender in the crowded November field, blasted Mamdani for declining debate invitations from PIX11 and CBS News.“New Yorkers deserve answers. I challenge him to five debates, one in every borough where we speak about the issues in that borough,” Cuomo said at a press conference.Mamdani, however, has said he will only take part in the two debates scheduled by the city’s campaign finance board in October. “In the meantime, I won’t be at this televised circus,” he told voters in a video message.Meanwhile, sources told The New York Post that administration officials had considered offering jobs to mayor Eric Adams and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa in a bid to persuade them to exit the race—an outcome that could strengthen Cuomo’s chances against Mamdani.","NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has thrown down a challenge to US President Donald Trump.

Washington, DC, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the Donald Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops to the US capital, arguing the move violates both the Constitution and federal law.“President Donald Trump has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy—that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement,” DC attorney general Brian Schwalb wrote in the filing.“These unprecedented, unlawful actions have subjected the District to serious and irreparable harm,” he added, as quoted by CNBC News.The lawsuit names Trump and the leaders of the Pentagon, department of justice, Army, and US marshals service as defendants. It seeks a permanent injunction blocking Trump’s order.Trump on August 11 placed the DC police department under federal control and deployed hundreds of national guard troops under the city’s Home Rule Act.The statute allows temporary presidential control in emergencies but limits it to 30 days unless Congress authorises an extension. Since then, the Guard presence has swelled to about 2,200 troops, according to the lawsuit.Officials have said they could remain through the end of the year.The White House defended the deployment, saying Trump acted lawfully. “The lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.She added, as reported by CNBC News, that Trump “is well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington D.C. to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement with specific tasks.”Trump’s efforts to send the military into US cities have already faced legal challenges.Earlier this week, US District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco blocked him from deploying the Guard to enforce law in California. The decision is limited to California and stayed until September 12, but it marked a setback for Trump’s broader push.Trump has signaled he is considering similar deployments in other cities, including Chicago. “We’re going in. I didn’t say when, but we’re going in,” he told reporters at the White House.","Washington, DC, filed a federal lawsuit against the Donald Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops to the US capital.

Tensions over energy and trade

Limited progress on mediation

A divided Europe





US President Donald Trump called on European nations to take stronger economic action against China on Friday, urging them to stop purchasing Russian oil due to Beijing’s support for Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The remarks were made during a video conference with European leaders gathered in Paris, according to a senior White House official who spoke to AFP on the condition of anonymity.Trump’s call for European nations to halt oil purchases from Russia comes as part of ongoing international efforts to isolate Moscow economically following its invasion of Ukraine. ""Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,"" Trump emphasized during the virtual meeting, the official said.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also participated in the call, echoed concerns about European nations continuing to buy Russian oil. Zelenskyy pointed out that Hungary and Slovakia were particularly active in these purchases, despite the ongoing war and international sanctions aimed at punishing Russia.The Ukrainian leader also mentioned that the discussion included topics like further sanctions on Russia and ways to protect Ukraine’s airspace from Russian attacks.Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, Zelenskyy noted that Trump remains ""very dissatisfied"" with Europe's reliance on Russian energy.While Trump has made it clear that he believes the US should take a tougher stance on China’s role in the Ukraine conflict, the US has yet to impose similar sanctions on Beijing as it has on countries like India. India has faced sanctions for purchasing Russian oil, but Trump has refrained from taking similar action against China, which is one of the largest importers of Russian energy.In recent weeks, Trump has also turned up the rhetorical heat on China, accusing President Xi Jinping of conspiring with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. This accusation came after the three leaders gathered in Beijing to observe a military parade commemorating the end of World War II. Trump’s words have added fuel to the fire of US-China tensions, particularly over China’s strategic partnership with Russia.Trump’s call for Europe to take more decisive action comes as his previous attempts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine have yielded little success. Despite claiming to be seeking an end to the war, Trump has remained largely silent on what his next steps will be in the quest for a resolution. His efforts at diplomacy, including his outreach to Russian and Ukrainian officials, have failed to result in any significant breakthroughs.The US president’s tough stance on Russia and China contrasts with his earlier position of focusing on economic pressure and diplomatic solutions. But as the war in Ukraine stretches into its second year, Trump’s frustration with both Europe’s energy dependency and China’s ongoing support for Russia seems to be growing.While Trump’s call for a unified European response to Russia’s war in Ukraine may find support among some leaders, the continent remains divided on how best to address Russia’s influence. Countries like Hungary and Slovakia, which rely heavily on Russian energy supplies, have been reluctant to implement tougher sanctions or reduce energy imports. This has been a key point of contention for European leaders who are more committed to sanctions against Russia but are also mindful of the economic repercussions on their own energy markets.As the international community continues to grapple with the geopolitical fallout from the war, Trump’s remarks further underscore the growing rift between Europe and the US over how to manage both the Russian threat and the broader international landscape, particularly in relation to China’s growing alignment with Moscow.With the situation continuing to evolve, Trump’s insistence on more aggressive action against China and his growing frustration with Europe’s energy dependency could signal more tension in transatlantic relations as the war in Ukraine shows few signs of resolution.",US President Donald Trump called on European nations to take stronger economic action against China on Friday.

Former US national security adviser John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified U.S. defense documents, following raids on his Maryland home and Washington, DC, office last month.According to court records, Bolton is under investigation for violating two sections of the Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibit the unauthorized possession or removal of national defense information, as well as a statute against hoarding classified files.If convicted on all counts, the 76-year-old could face up to 25 years in prison. He has not been arrested or formally charged.The warrant revealed that Bolton is being investigated for allegedly emailing classified files to family members using a private server during Trump’s first term.On August 22, federal agents searched his Bethesda residence and DC office, seizing three computers, two iPhones, two USB drives, a hard drive, and several boxes of documents. The seized materials included “typed documents in folders labeled ‘Trump I–IV’” and a binder titled “statements and reflections to allied strikes,"" reported The New York Post.The case had been shelved under the Biden administration but was revived by current FBI director Kash Patel shortly after he took office in February.“The [Biden administration] had probable cause to know that he had taken material that was detrimental to the national security of the United States, and they made no effort to retrieve it,” a senior FBI official told The Post.The Justice Department is now reviewing whether the earlier decision not to pursue charges was politically motivated.Despite the investigation, Bolton has continued to speak out against Trump’s policies.“The White House has set US-India relations back decades, pushing Modi closer to Russia and China,” Bolton posted on X Wednesday. “Beijing has cast itself as an alternative to the US and Donald Trump.”Bolton, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under George W Bush, was Trump’s national security adviser from 2018 to 2019.","Bolton is under investigation for violating two sections of the Espionage Act of 1917.

IuM-Pakistan claims suicide bomb attack on army convoy in KP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ium-pakistan-claims-suicide-bomb-attack-on-army-convoy-in-kp/articleshow/123688414.cms,"



A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.
