Poonch is part of Anantnag-Rajouri parliamentary constituency which is going to polls in the sixth phase on May 25.The vehicles were moving towards nearby Sanai Top in the district's Surankote area, they said, suspecting the involvement of the same group of terrorists who carried out an ambush on the troops in adjoining Bufliaz on December 21 last year, that left four soldiers dead and three others injured.The Army truck bore the major brunt of the firing by the terrorists who were armed with AK assault rifles and are believed to have fled into the nearby forests, the officials said.Additional forces from the army and police have been deployed to the region and cordon operation has been launched to track down and neutralise the terrorists.A comprehensive search and cordon operation is currently underway to locate and neutralize the terrorists responsible for the attack, as per the officials.Police assisted by paramilitary forces carried out searches in Poonch town since Friday following inputs about movement of suspected persons. However, no one was arrested during the operation, the officials said.The latest incident in the Pir Panjal region followed the killing of a government employee Mohd Razaq, brother of an Army personnel, by terrorists at village Kunda Top in Rajouri's Shahdra area on April 22 and a village defence guard Mohd Sharief in Basantgarh area of Udhampur on April 28.Police have released pictures of two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists, including suspected Pakistani national Abu Hamza, involved in the murder of Razaq and announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head.The Bufliaz ambush in December last year came weeks after a major gunfight in the Dharmsal belt of Bajimaal forest in Rajouri that left five Army personnel, including two captains, dead a month earlier.Two terrorists, including a top commander of LeT identified as Quari, were also killed in the two-day long gunfight. Quari was said to be the mastermind behind several attacks, including the killing of 10 civilians and five Army personnel in the district.The stretch between Dhera Ki Gali and Bufliaz on the boundary of Rajouri and Poonch is densely forested and leads to Chamrer forest and then Bhata Dhurian forest, where five soldiers were killed in an ambush on an Army vehicle on April 20 last year.In May last year, five more Army personnel were killed and a major-rank officer was injured in Chamrer forest during an anti-terrorist operation. A foreign terrorist was also killed in the operation.In 2022, five Army personnel were killed when terrorists carried out a suicide attack on their camp at Pargal in Darhal area of Rajouri district. Both the terrorists involved in the attack were eliminated.In 2021, nine soldiers were killed in two separate attacks by terrorists in the forested region.

"Jaishankar on Nijjar plot: Canada blames us, but shows no evidence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-on-nijjar-plot-canada-blames-us-but-shows-no-evidence/articleshow/109846407.cms,"Suspects in relation to the murder in Canada of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. (Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday that Canada never provides any evidence but blames India for crimes committed there, while a Canadian govt report — “Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions” — claimed Indian officials and proxies engage in a range of activities to influence Canadian communities and politicians, and that “India directed foreign interference activities” during the 2019 and 2021 general elections in Canada.Jaishankar’s remarks come after Canadian police said they were looking at possible Indian links following the arrests of three Indian nationals for the killing of pro-Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , designated a terrorist by India.Canada has “allowed organised crime, specifically from Punjab, to operate from there”, the foreign minister said at a press conference in Bhubaneswar.“I just saw before coming in that three people have been arrested. They apparently are Indians with some kind of a gang background. We will wait for the police to tell us more. But normally, if you don’t have a political agenda, if I say I suspect you, I will produce the proof,” he said at a press conference. “We have never been given anything by Canada which involves the govt of India. In fact, we have repeatedly told you (the Canadian govt), if you have something, please give it to us,” Jaishankar added.The Canadian report by commissioner Marie-Josée Hogue refers to Indian officials, including Canada-based proxies, engaging to influence Canadian communities and politicians. The report said their aim is to “align Canada’s position with India’s interests on key issues, particularly how the Indian govt perceives Canada-based supporters of an independent Sikh homeland”. The World Sikh Organization (WSO) of Canada, which put the report in the public domain, is a hardline group advocating for the creation of a separate nation of Khalistan.Blaming “vote bank” politics in Canada for problems there, Jaishankar said the situation has turned worse because the governing party has no majority. The party they depend on is pro-Khalistani , he said, adding that India has been consistently urging Canada against giving space to separatists and against giving them political legitimacy because the same will create problems for both India and Canada and in their relations.“There are 25 examples I have with me, who are either known pro-Khalistani individuals or part of gangs involved in crimes. We have given them extradition requests, they did nothing. There is a gang war going on there. They shift blame to India every time. But investigative agencies there never give any proof. What I feel is that it’s a political game,” he said.Jaishankar also dismissed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan’s accusation in a column in a UK daily that India is carrying out killings in Pakistan. The foreign minister said there is no dearth of terrorists to commit such crimes in Pakistan. Khan had claimed that “India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile...”Responding to Khan’s article, Jaishankar said, “Now, from what we can see, there are reports that some people who have a background in terrorism, some of them died in pretty unusual circumstances. That is something they need to investigate.”“Terrorists are not very nice people. They could be doing things to each other. I am not entirely aware of the Khan article. But I do know (that) rather than saying why these people are dying, I would first ask why there are so many terrorists in Pakistan. And why is Pakistan so protective of them? That is the question which should be answered,” Jaishankar said.The Canadian report, meanwhile, said, “India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism… Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India’s foreign influence activities,” the report claims.About the alleged interference in the 2019 and 2021 general elections, it claims: “A body of intelligence indicates that Indian proxy agents may have attempted to interfere in democratic processes, reportedly through the clandestine provision of illicit financial support to various Canadian politicians as a means of attempting to secure the election of pro-India candidates or gaining influence over candidates who take office.”In another section, titled “Suspected Foreign Interference by the Government of India”, it has mentioned that during Canada's federal election, Indian officials were observed “expressing interest in individual electoral contests” and likely hoped “pro-India candidates would prevail”.","S Jaishankar says Canada never provides any evidence but blames India for crimes committed there.

BENGALURU: Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna has been accused of raping a 44-year-old former panchayat member after threatening to shoot her and her husband dead with a gun, according to her complaint lodged with Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on May 1.The woman's complaint is the first in which Prajwal has been charged with rape under IPC Section 376.He and his father HD Revanna were accused of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation in an FIR registered on April 28 by Holenarispura Town police on the basis of a complaint from a former employee of their household.The woman politician told police she often took up people's issues with MLAs and MPs. In 2021, she approached Prajwal Revanna at his MP's quarters, Hassan, regarding obtaining hostel seats for college students.

He asked her to warn her husband to talk less and threatened her with dire consequences.Later, he asked her to obey him and meet his physical needs if her husband was to grow politically. “As I refused, he threatened me, saying he had a gun and would not spare me and my hus band. Then he raped me. While abusing me, he recorded the act on his mobile phone and threatened to leak the videos if I revealed the incident. He forced me to meet his physical needs whenever he required,” she stated.By threatening to eliminate her husband, who would often be with him, Prajwal allegedly made her strip, made multiple videos and raped her many times.The case has been registered un der IPC Sections 376 (2) (N) (raping the same woman repeatedly), 354 A (1) (sexual harassment), 354 B (assault or use of criminal force to a woman with intent to disrobe), 354 C (voyeurism), and under the Information Technology Act.","Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna has been accused of raping a 44-year-old former panchayat member.

"Pro-Palestine protests: Fresh stir in US college campuses, over 2,300 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestine-protests-fresh-stir-in-us-college-campuses-over-2000-arrested/articleshow/109801954.cms,"NEW DELHI: Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday, following weeks of demonstrations and police crackdowns at college campuses nationwide that have resulted in more than 2,300 arrests.About a dozen protesters who refused police orders to leave were arrested and about 30 more left voluntarily, according to NYU spokesperson John Beckman.The school asked the New York Police Department to intervene “to minimize the likelihood of injury"" and disruption, Beckman said.Classes will proceed as scheduled on Friday, he said. A larger NYU encampment was dismantled on April 22, when more than 130 protesters were arrested.The protests and arrests have taken place in nearly every part of the country, but in the last 24 hours, the University of California, Los Angeles has been the center of attention, where tumultuous scenes unfolded early Thursday as officers in riot gear clashed with protesters.At UCLA, hundreds of demonstrators refused to comply with orders to disperse, with some creating human chains as police used flash-bangs to disperse the crowds.Later on Thursday morning, workers cleared the protesters' fortified encampment, removing barricades and using bulldozers to collect trash and tents. Some buildings were covered with graffiti.The protests began at Columbia University on April 17, with students demanding an end to the Israel-Hamas conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the health ministry there. Israel initiated its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed approximately 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and took around 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel on Oct 7.UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated on Thursday that the encampment had become ""a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption,"" endangering people on campus, preventing students from attending classes, forcing building closures, and leading to class cancellations.California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the UCLA campus in large numbers early Thursday, wearing protective gear and using batons to separate themselves from protesters, who were equipped with helmets and gas masks and chanted, ""You want peace. We want justice.""Officers warned protesters for hours that they would be arrested if they did not disperse, and there were scuffles and shoving between protesters and police. Police helicopters circled overhead, and the sound of flash-bangs filled the air. As arrests were made, police removed protesters' helmets and goggles.The law enforcement response and ongoing warnings contrasted with the events of Tuesday night, when counter-demonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing objects, using pepper spray, and tearing down barriers. The fighting continued for hours before police intervened, resulting in no arrests but at least 15 injured protesters. The lukewarm response from authorities drew criticism from various groups and leaders.By Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, with hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set, while others chanted “we’re not leaving” or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas.Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers — some of whom are Jewish — call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.US President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the students’ right to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.Meanwhile, a Police officer fired the gun while clearing protesters from Columbia University administration building earlier this week.More than 100 protesters were taken into custody during Columbia's crackdown on Tuesday. They are part of more than 2,000 people who have been arrested during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks.Columbia's demonstrators had seized Hamilton Hall early on Tuesday, ramping up their presence on the campus from a tent encampment that had been there since April 17. The encampment was one of the earliest on college campuses.Despite more than 100 arrests on April 18 and the clearing of the tents, the protesters defied threats of suspension to return to the encampment. Then they escalated their demonstration by occupying Hamilton Hall, an administration building that was similarly seized in 1968 by students protesting racism and the Vietnam War.(With inputs from agencies)","Police ordered pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon a tent encampment at New York University early Friday.

NEW DELHI: Anti-war demonstrations stopped this week at a few US universities after university officials made agreements with pro-Palestinian protesters to prevent any disruptions of final exams and graduation ceremonies.The agreements at schools such as Brown, Northwestern, and Rutgers are among the few universities that witnessed over 2,400 arrests on 46 campuses across the country since April 17.Deals include commitments made by universities to review their investments in Israel or even consider calls to stop doing business with the long-time US ally.""I think for some universities, it might be just a delaying tactic to diffuse the protests,"" AP quoted Ralph Young, a history professor who studies American dissent at Temple University in Philadelphia.""The end of the semester is happening now. And maybe by the time the next semester begins, there is a cease-fire in Gaza.""Protesters at the University of Vermont achieved success when the university administration declared on Friday that the commencement speaker, the US ambassador to the United Nations, would no longer deliver a speech to the graduating students at the end of this month.The demonstrators, who set up a camp on Sunday, had requested that Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's speech be excluded from the upcoming ceremony due to her involvement in the US vetoing several UN cease-fire resolutions.Israel has accused the protests of being anti-Semitic; critics claim that the country employs such accusations to suppress dissent. While a few demonstrators were reported making anti-Semitic comments or threats of violence, the organizers of the protest - including some who are Jewish - have described it as a peaceful campaign to support Palestinian rights and oppose the war.Administrators at the University of California, Riverside, made an announcement on Friday that they reached an agreement with protesters to shut down their campus encampment. The deal included the formation of a task force to explore removing Riverside's endowment from the broader UC system's management and investing those funds ""in a manner that will be financially and ethically sound for the university with consideration to the companies involved in arms manufacturing and delivery.""The announcement marked an apparent split with the policy of the 10-campus UC system, which last week said it opposes ""calls for boycott against and divestment from Israel.""""While the University affirms the right of our community members to express diverse viewpoints, a boycott of this sort impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses,"" the system said in a statement.""UC tuition and fees are the primary funding sources for the University's core operations. None of these funds are used for investment purposes.""Demonstrators at Rutgers University, where finals were paused due to the protests on its New Brunswick campus, also packed up their tents on Thursday afternoon. The state university agreed to establish an Arab Cultural Center and not to retaliate against any students involved in the camp.Chancellor Francine Conway mentioned the protesters' demand to stop investing in companies that have business dealings with Israel and to end Rutgers' connections with Tel Aviv University. She said the the request is under review, but ""such decisions fall outside of our administrative scope.""Protesters at Brown University in Rhode Island agreed to take down their camp on Tuesday. School officials mentioned that students have the opportunity to make a case for removing Brown's investment from companies involved in and benefiting from the conflict in Gaza.In addition, President Christina Paxson of Brown University will request an advisory committee to provide a suggestion on divestment by September 30. This recommendation will then be presented to the university's governing corporation for a vote in October.Northwestern's Deering Meadow in suburban Chicago also became quiet after reaching an agreement on Monday. The agreement reduced protest actions in exchange for bringing back an advisory committee on university investments and other obligations.The arrangement received criticism from both sides. Some pro-Palestinian protesters condemned it as a failure to stick to their original demands, while some supporters of Israel said it represented ""cowardly' capitulation.Seven of 18 members subsequently resigned from a university committee that advises the administration on addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia and expressions of hatred on campus, saying they couldn't continue to serve ""with antisemitism so present at Northwestern in public view for the past week.""Michael Simon, who is the executive director of an organization for Jewish students called Northwestern Hillel, mentioned that he resigned because he believed that the committee would not be able to reach its objectives.Faculty at Pomona College in California voted in favor of divesting from companies they said are funding Israel's war in Gaza, a group of faculty and students said Friday.The vote on Thursday does not have a binding effect on the liberal arts school, which has almost 1,800 students located to the east of Los Angeles. However, supporters expressed their hope that this vote would motivate the board to cease investing in these companies and to begin disclosing the locations of its investments.""This nonbinding faculty statement does not represent any official position of Pomona College,"" the school said in a statement. ""We will continue to encourage further dialogue within in our community, including consideration of counterarguments.""The movement started on April 17 at Columbia, where student protesters constructed a camp to demand an end to the Israel-Hamas conflict.Late Tuesday, the police arrested over 100 individuals when they disbanded the Columbia encampment. According to the NYPD, an officer unintentionally fired his weapon inside Hamilton Hall during the operation on late Thursday.According to the health ministry in Gaza Strip, more than 34,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in the conflict. Following the incident on October 7, where Hamas militants caused the death of approximately 1,200 individuals, mainly civilians, and held around 250 hostages in southern Israel, Israel initiated its offensive.","Protesters at Brown, Northwestern, and Rutgers are among the few universities that witnessed over 2,400 arrests on 46 campuses across the country since April 17.

You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi. PTI leader Shehryar Afridi said that his party will hold ""dialogue with the chief of army staff (COAS) and the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI) soon"" instead of speaking to ""rejected people"" who reached parliament through Form 47.Chaudhry expressed skepticism about Khan's likelihood of striking such a deal, asserting that Shehbaz Sharif's current threats originate not from within his party but from external forces.","Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has accused Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa of bias against his party.

They are constructed in cubic shape, often weigh no more than a few kg, and are deployed in space for various purposes.Weighing around 7 kg, the iCUBE-Q orbiter carries two cameras to take images of the lunar surface and has other sensors and apparatus for deep-space communication, altitude control, and other functions.The primary criteria for mission success, officials said, will be achieved with the successful separation of the iCUBE-Q from the Chang’e-6 Orbiter. Following separation, the secondary criteria will involve the satellite receiving a beacon signal that will confirm that the orbiter is working satisfactorily.Finally, the orbiter will take pictures of the Earth, and Moon and try to take pictures of at least two objects together (Earth, Moon, and the orbiter).As part of data collection, authorities said, iCUBE-Q will also collect data on the lunar magnetic field, establish a lunar magnetic field model, and lay the groundwork for future missions and international lunar cooperation.Dr Khurram Khurshid, a senior member associated with Pakistan’s space programme, said the satellite will reach the lunar orbit in five days and will circle the moon for three to six months.He added that different pictures of the surface of the moon will be taken with the orbiter’s help, after which Pakistan will have its own satellite images of the Moon for research.","Pakistan launched its first-ever lunar mission, iCube-Qamar, on Friday.

All that is left for Pak Army is to 'murder me': Imran Khan writes from prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/all-that-is-left-for-pak-army-is-to-murder-me-imran-khan-writes-from-prison/articleshow/109821286.cms,"LONDON/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country where political leaders like him languish in jail and said all that is left for the powerful military leadership was to ""murder"" him.In a column for the UK's ‘Daily Telegraph' newspaper, penned from the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where he is being held for disputed corruption charges, the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician reiterated his previous assertion that if anything happens to him or his wife, General Asim Munir – the Chief of Army Staff, will be responsible.The founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the cash-strapped country was at a “dangerous crossroads”, with the government a “laughing stock”.“The military establishment has done all they could against me. All that is left for them is to now murder me,” writes Khan.“I have stated publicly that if anything happens to me or my wife (Bushra Bibi), Gen. Asim Munir will be responsible. But I am not afraid because my faith is strong. I would prefer death over slavery,” he says.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy. However, the military has denied meddling in the country's politics.Khan warned that the state was treading the same path it trod in 1971, when it lost East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.“At the same time, it is seeing an upsurge in terrorism and a growing alienation in Balochistan where the issue of enforced disappearances is growing in severity. On Pakistan's borders, India has already admitted to undertaking assassinations inside of Pakistan and the international border with Afghanistan remains volatile,” he notes.Khan notes the military establishment's expectation of “unquestioning support” from the US, in return for the provision of access to airspace and related facilities to the US for military purposes, has been punctured after the publication of the latest US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which highlights the many human rights violations in Pakistan.“With an economy in crisis, spiralling prices and a people politically angry at having their electoral mandate stolen and being economically beleaguered, the state stands isolated,” he writes.Khan hailed the “democratic revenge” of the February 8 general election, during which people came out and “voted overwhelmingly” for candidates supported by his party.“Unfortunately, instead of accepting the people's mandate, the military establishment went into a fit of rage and electoral results were manipulated to bring into power the losers. The same vote tampering was seen in the recent by-elections,” he notes.The PTI founder also praised the six “brave judges” of the Islamabad High Court who have written a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan highlighting instances of harassment and blackmail including of their families by intelligence agencies.“This is unprecedented in our history – although, informally, many knew what was happening to the senior judiciary but for such a letter to have come from these judges shows the level of despair, anger and frustration,” he writes.","Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lamented the sorry state of affairs in the country.

Zay Yar Tun fills his truck with water for delivery to refugees in the parched hills of war-ravaged eastern Myanmar, where a heatwave is adding to the misery of life in displacement camps.Under a roof of plastic sheets in one of the camps in Kayah state, Augusta waits for the 10 gallons that must cover her family's drinking, cooking and washing needs for the next three days.More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah by the conflict unleashed by the military's 2021 coup, according to the United Nations .Now, a heatwave that has sent the mercury in Myanmar to 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in some places has added to uncertainties of life in the camps.""Last year, we got water from a spring nearby,"" Augusta told AFP.""But now we can't get water from that place as there is no water left there.""We have to be frugal...

Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem.""

'Change course'

LONDON: London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan on Saturday secured a record third term, as the party swept a host of mayoral races and local elections to trounce the ruling Conservatives just months before an expected general election.Khan, 53, beat Tory challenger Susan Hall by 11 points to scupper largely forlorn Tory hopes that they could prise the UK capital away from Labour for the first time since 2016.The first Muslim mayor of a Western capital when initially elected then, he had been widely expected to win as the opposition party surges nationally and the Tories struggle to revive their fortunes.Hours later in the West Midlands, Conservative mayor Andy Street -- bidding for his own third term -- unexpectedly lost to Labour's Richard Parker, dealing a hammer blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.That narrow loss left the beleaguered leader with only one notable success in Thursday's votes across England, after Tory mayor Ben Houchen won in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.In a dismal set of results, Sunak's party finished a humiliating third in local council tallies after losing nearly 500 seats.""People across the country have had enough of Conservative chaos and decline and voted for change with Labour,"" its leader Keir Starmer said shortly after confirmation of Parker's victory.He called the result ""phenomenal"" and ""beyond our expectations"".Writing earlier in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak had conceded ""voters are frustrated"" but tried to argue Labour was ""not winning in places they admit they need for a majority"".""We Conservatives have everything to fight for,"" Sunak insisted.Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, also emphatically snatched a parliamentary seat from the Tories.Starmer has seized on winning the Blackpool South constituency and other successes to demand a general election.Sunak must order a national vote be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of his 18 months in charge, as previous Tory scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent his party's standing.On Thursday, it was defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when it led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.In the end, they lost close to half and finished third behind the smaller centrist opposition Liberal Democrats.Meanwhile Labour swept crunch mayoral races across England, from Yorkshire, Manchester and Liverpool in the north to contests across the Midlands.In London, Khan netted 44 percent of the vote and saw his margin of victory increase compared to the last contest in 2021.""It's truly an honour to be re-elected for a third term,"" he told supporters, accusing his Tory opponent of ""fearmongering"".""We ran a campaign that was in keeping with the spirit and values of this great city, a city that regards our diversity not as a weakness, but as an almighty strength -- and one that rejects right hard-wing populism,"" he added.If replicated in a nationwide contest, the council tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.Speculation has been rife in Westminster that restive Tory lawmakers could use dire local election results to try to replace Sunak.Despite the returns being at the worst end of estimates, that prospect has not so far materialised.Ex-interior minister and Sunak critic Suella Braverman warned in the Sunday Telegraph that Sunak's plan ""is not working and he needs to change course"", urging a more muscular conservatism.But she cautioned against trying to replace him, warning ""changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went"".Meanwhile, polling expert John Curtice assessed there were some concerning signs for Labour, which lost control of one local authority and some councillors elsewhere reportedly over its stance on the Israel-Hamas war.""These were more elections in which the impetus to defeat the Conservatives was greater than the level of enthusiasm for Labour,"" Curtice noted in the i newspaper.""Electorally, it is still far from clear that Sir Keir Starmer is the heir to (Tony) Blair.""","London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan secures a record third term.

Voters swing to labour in English local elections: Key takeaways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/voters-swing-to-labour-in-english-local-elections-key-takeaways/articleshow/109830470.cms,"The Conservatives could be in serious trouble.

Labour's 'red wall' is returning to the fold

The election showed how Reform UK may siphon votes from the Conservatives

New voting regulations went well. (Just not for Johnson.)

While the votes in local elections in England and Wales were still being counted Friday, a picture has begun to emerge of significant losses for the governing Conservative Party .The voting Thursday to elect councilors, mayors and police commissioners in local elections, seen as a last test of public opinion before a general election expected later this year, portends a difficult road ahead for the party.Here are four takeaways.Leading up to the local elections, the question was not whether the Conservatives would suffer, but just how bad the blow might be. The party has trailed Labour, the main opposition party, in opinion polls for some time, after a series of scandals, the implosion of Boris Johnson 's administration and the embarrassment of the 45-day prime ministership of Liz Truss, leading many Britons to look elsewhere for leadership.By midday Friday, the early results suggested that the party might have fared even more poorly than its leaders had feared. When all is said and done, some analysts think the Conservatives could lose as many as 500 council seats, a signal of serious trouble ahead for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's beleaguered Conservative Party.About one-third of England's council seats were contested, along with 11 mayoral seats in major English metro areas. Although these elections were about local leadership, the results of Thursday's vote serve as an important barometer of overall public opinion, and ultimately a test of whether the Conservative Party can retain power in a general election expected this fall.Labour won control of a number of key councils, including Hartlepool, Thurrock, Rushmoor and Redditch, all of which were seen as battleground races that could gauge broader public sentiment.However, the Conservatives had some notable wins to cling to, including the Tees Valley mayoral race, where incumbent Ben Houchen received the majority of the vote, albeit with a much smaller percentage than in his last election.The election made clear that the opposition Labour Party was succeeding in winning back its longtime supporters in the working-class areas of northern England -- often called the ""red wall"" for their entrenched support for Labour, whose party color is red -- who had defected over Brexit and immigration.After Labour won control of the council in Hartlepool, a party representative said, ""Making gains here shows that the party is on track to win a general election and is firmly back in the service of working people.""In Blackpool South, a deprived seaside district, the Labour Party easily took a parliamentary by-election held Thursday after a Conservative lawmaker stepped down. The seat had long been held by Labour, but it was won by the Conservatives in 2019.Keir Starmer , the Labour Party leader, said the win was a message sent directly by the public to Sunak ""to say we're fed up with your decline, your chaos, your division, and we want change.""But Labour also faced some pushback, possibly as an effect of its staunch support for Israel in the war in the Gaza Strip and a delay in calling for a cease-fire, that could dampen the party's gains in some northern places, a senior Labour figure, Pat McFadden, acknowledged to Sky News. Notably, the party lost control of the Oldham Council, where a large Muslim population seemed to shift its votes to independent candidates, he added.Reform UK, a right-wing party founded by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, ran relatively few candidates in the elections. But their performance in some key races suggested that they could have a major effect on the general election.In the Blackpool South election, which was overwhelmingly won by the Labour candidate, Chris Webb, Reform UK received nearly as many votes as the Conservatives, with a margin of just 117 votes between the two (3,218 to 3,101.)The results seemingly confirmed opinion polls that put the party third behind Labour and the Tories, underscoring the threat it could pose to the Conservatives in the upcoming general election.Thursday's vote was the first test of new voting regulations stemming from the Elections Act of 2022, and election monitors said the process went smoothly, with some notable exceptions.The vote marked the first time in England that every voter needed to show photo identification, and Johnson, the former prime minister, was reportedly turned away from his polling place after arriving without it, according to Sky News. He later returned with the necessary identification and voted.Some veterans complained that they were unable to use veteran's identification cards to vote, as they were not an approved form of photo identification. Johnny Mercer, the minister of veterans' affairs, said in a post on the social media platform X that he was sorry it had become an issue. He vowed that the cards would be accepted in the next election.But Britain's Electoral Commission, the independent body that oversees the election, said in a statement that ""most voters who wanted to vote were able to do so,"" and that it would ""identify any potential obstacles to participation.""","Local elections in England and Wales were held Thursday.

But Thursday was the first time large numbers of voters across England and Wales have had to present ID, such as a passport or driving license, to vote.The Electoral Commission said the vast majority of people were able to meet the new requirements, although it noted that some people who would have wanted to vote may have decided not to try because they did not have acceptable ID.It also said there was evidence that some people, such as disabled people and the unemployed, found it harder to show voter ID.",Boris Johnson was turned away from a polling station after forgetting to bring ID to vote in UK's local elections.

Labour wins Blackpool South seat in UK by-election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-wins-blackpool-south-seat-in-uk-by-election/articleshow/109805335.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK's Labour party on Friday defeated the ruling Conservatives and secured the Blackpool South constituency parliamentary seat in a by-election that was held along with the council elections. The recent defeat is expected to increase pressure on the embattled Conservatives leader, Rishi Sunak when the country is going to polls next year.Labour's Chris Webb won with a swing of 26.3 percent.It was the third largest margin from the Conservatives to Labour in a by-election since World War II.""This seismic win in Blackpool South is the most important result today,"" said Labour leader Keir Starmer .The by-election was conducted following a lobbying scandal that led to the resignation of the Conservative MP from this constituency.The ruling Conservative Party, which has been in power nationally since 2010 is expected to witness significant losses in the upcoming general elections.Additionally, early results indicated that the Labour party was gaining council seats. However, the focus was on important regional and London mayoral races, the results of which are anticipated on Friday and Saturday.The Labour mayor of the capital, Sadiq Khan, is expected to secure a historic third term. However, the mayoral competitions in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, located in northeast England, are forecasted to be closely contested.A win for the Labour opposition in any of the regions, which are known for being indicative constituencies, would be seen as more proof that voters are willing to bring the party back to national power.There is a lot of speculation in the UK parliament at Westminster that if there is a poor performance, some restless Tory lawmakers may attempt to replace Sunak, who has been in charge since October 2022.The victories of the current Conservative mayors in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, namely Andy Street and Ben Houchen, could increase their optimism that the troubled leader can still improve their prospects.However, the Tories are facing criticism nationally on various issues such as water pollution, transport, and inflation, leading Street and Houchen to seem to separate themselves from the party during the campaign.Pollsters predict that the Conservative Party may lose approximately half of the nearly 1,000 council seats they are currently defending in various cities, towns, and districts throughout England.It is concerning for Sunak that the Conservatives barely secured second place in Blackpool South before the fringe Reform UK party, which poses a threat to split the right-wing vote in the upcoming general election.","UK's Labour party on Friday defeated the ruling Conservatives and secured the Blackpool South constituency parliamentary seat.
