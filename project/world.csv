'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal

Observing that a govt must behave as a ‘model employer’ and lack of funds cannot be a ground to deny its employees their dues, Supreme Court Thursday directed West Bengal govt to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra ordered that the first instalment should be paid by March 31 and appointed a committee, comprising its former judge Indu Malhotra, former chief justice of Jharkhand HC Tarlok Singh Chauhan, former HC judge Goutam Bhaduri and Comptroller and Auditor General of India, to monitor implementation of its order.SC rejected Bengal govt’s defence it lacked funds and said it is not open for the State to shirk its responsibility of paying DA on account of financial difficulty, given that it is an obligation arising out of a statute of its own creation.“It has often been recognised that the State must set an example for other employers in the country by behaving as a ‘model employer’. Such a position should not be difficult to attain given all the advantages that it has. Its power lies in the volume of employment, its sovereign/constitutional authority to tax, ability to borrow and manage public finances... Leading by example, fulfilling its financial duties in times of fiscal strain, gives it the moral authority to wield the sword of law against private entities, should they not do so.SC said the least that is expected of a State in a democracy is that it honours its obligations and commitments arising from a legislation or judicial decisions, for such obligations are not discretionary.“This clear position protects such statutory obligations, for if such a ground of limited financial ability was readily available to govt, which may undoubtedly in certain situations face tough times, it would render these obligations illusory. When it comes to employees’ dues, this proposition would be extremely dangerous and stifling since the amounts received thereby are not handouts or acts of charity but are earned compensation/consideration for services given,” it said.",West Bengal govt ordered to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period.

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

PUNE: After Sharad Pawar took charge of steering the ship for his family following the death of his nephew Ajit Pawar, its members on Thursday backed deputy chief minister Sunetra Pawar’s name as NCP’s national president. While some other senior NCP functionaries showed reluctance for a merger with NCP (SP), the Pawar family said Sunetra would speak about it on behalf of her party.Interacting with reporters in Baramati, NCP (SP) state general secretary and Ajit Pawar’s nephew Rohit Pawar said: “As the Pawar family, we also wish that after taking charge as deputy CM, Sunetra Kaki (aunt) should be the next NCP chief.” On the issue of merger, he said there had been no discussion so far in the family. “We will take it up after the mourning period as it is important to know the members’ opinions. Since Sunetra Kaki (aunt) has taken charge as deputy CM and all NCP MLAs support her, she will speak on the merger after Feb 9. We can then discuss it thereafter.”Possibility of a re-unification grew stronger after Pawar Senior took the lead to minimise tension within the family when he went to meet Sunetra and her sons at their Baramati residence for the second consecutive day on Thursday. Some senior NCP members, including Patel and state chief Sunil Tatkare, have refuted Sharad Pawar’s claim that his nephew had initiated steps for NCP’s merger.",Sharad Pawar took charge of steering the ship for his family following the death of his nephew Ajit Pawar.

"In 10 years, trial courts awarded death to 1,310, high courts upheld 106",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-10-years-trial-courts-awarded-death-to-1310-high-courts-upheld-106/articleshow/127961651.cms,"Represenatative image

Trial courts across the country continued to impose death penalty in significant numbers in 2025 even as appellate courts set aside or modified most of these sentences, raising “serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases”, finds an annual study by The Square Circle Clinic — a criminal justice initiative of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106, according to ‘Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics Report 2025’ released on Feb 4. Of the death sentences confirmed by HCs, Supreme Court decided a little over a half of them and upheld none, shows the report.The data points to a persistent gap between trial court sentencing and appellate outcomes. As of Dec 31 last year, 574 prisoners were on death row which the report described as “the largest number of persons on death row at the end of a calendar year since 2016”.In this backdrop, sessions courts sentenced 128 people to death across 94 cases in 2025, finds the study.In 2025 alone, HCs acquitted, commuted, remanded or recorded abatement in most of the death sentence cases they decided, and SC’s record reflects a similar pattern, shows the report. The study finds that the apex court has not confirmed a single death sentence in 2023-2025, even where HCs had initially upheld them.In 2025 alone, high courts acquitted 35 individuals across 22 cases. SC acquitted accused in more than half the cases it decided, recording the highest number of death row acquittals — 10 persons — in the past decade.“The frequency with which death sentences are overturned at the appellate stage raises serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases,” the report states.Those acquitted by HCs spent an average of 5.17 years on death row, with several remaining under death sentence for close to two decades before being exonerated.“High rates of acquittals from death row expose a deep fracture in the criminal legal system,” said Shreya Rastogi, director, litigation and forensics at The Square Circle Clinic. “When more than a third of HC confirmation cases result in acquittals, it indicates failures in investigation and prosecution that harm victims and accused alike. These errors cost people decades of their lives and freedom.”The failures identified by the report are spread across the criminal justice process, said Maitreyi Misra, director, research and mitigation, The Square Circle Clinic. “Supreme Court itself has repeatedly pointed out failures at multiple levels — investigation agencies, prosecution and lower courts — while acquitting people on death row,” she said.","From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106.

Married woman can’t claim rape on false marriage promise: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/married-woman-cant-claim-rape-on-false-marriage-promise-supreme-court/articleshow/127955508.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of the criminal justice system by filing of rape cases when a consenting relationship turns sour, Supreme Court on Thursday held that a married woman who gets into a physical relationship with another man cannot file a rape case against him on the ground that she got into the sexual relationship on the promise of marriage.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said in such cases, a woman was not eligible to get married due to the subsistence of her marriage and she could not invoke the ground of false promise of marriage. It passed the order while quashing criminal proceedings against a lawyer on a complaint filed by a woman advocate alleging that he had raped her on the false promise of marriage.The court said the complainant was already married when they were in a relationship and it was “a classic case of a consensual relationship turning acrimonious”.“Therefore, even for the sake of argument, if the contention is accepted that there indeed was a false promise of marriage based on which the accused indulged in sexual activities, such a promise would not be legally enforceable or even capable of being acted upon as the victim herself was not eligible for marriage, neither on the date of the first alleged act of offence nor on any subsequent dates wherein the parties indulged in sexual activities, till the point of the date of registration of FIR.The said embargo arises from sub-clause (i) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which categorically prohibits marriage between two individuals if either of them have a living spouse,” the bench observed.The bench said courts have to be extremely careful in identifying genuine rape cases by looking for the essential ingredients to constitute the said offence in view of the law being misused today.",A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said a woman was not eligible to get married due to the subsistence of her marriage.

Arrest mere statutory discretion to facilitate investigation, says the top court

NEW DELHI: Noting that an arrest can’t be made simply because it is lawful for the police officer to do so, SC on Thursday held that an investigating agency should not take an accused into custody for asking questions and the same should be done only when it is necessary for the probe.Enumerating various sections of the newly enacted Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh said a notice under Section 35(3) of the law to an accused or any individual concerned, qua offences punishable with imprisonment of up to 7 years, is the rule.“The power of arrest under Section 35(6) read with Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023 must be interpreted as a strict objective necessity, and not a subjective convenience for the police officer. It does not mean the police officer can arrest to simply ask questions,” the bench said.Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the court the requirement to issue a notice under Section 35(3) is absolute and cannot be bypassed solely by recording reasons for arrest.“Suffice it is to state that an investigation can go on even without an arrest.While undertaking the exercise of collecting the evidence for the purpose of forming his opinion over the commission of a cognizable offence, a police officer shall pose a question, to himself, on the necessity of an arrest. This safeguard is provided as, in any case, the power to arrest an accused person is always available with a police officer even after he records his reasons, in writing, for not doing so at an earlier stage,” the bench said.“On the basis of the interpretation given by us, we conclude as follows: An arrest by a police officer is a mere statutory discretion which facilitates him to conduct proper investigation, in the form of collection of evidence and, therefore, shall not be termed as mandatory. Consequently, the police officer shall ask himself the question as to whether an arrest is a necessity or not, before undertaking the said exercise,” it said.“...Even if the circumstances warranting an arrest of a person are available in terms of the conditions mentioned under Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023, the arrest shall not be undertaken, unless it’s absolutely warranted,” it said.","SC says an investigating agency should not take an accused into custody for asking questions.

GUWAHTI: Around a dozen protesters were wounded in a clash with security forces in Manipur’s Churachandpur Thursday as initial resentment within the Kuki-Zo community over its MLA Nemcha Kipgen agreeing to be a deputy CM in the reinstated NDA government snowballed into a backlash.The influential Kuki Zo Council declared a social boycott of any legislator from the community joining CM Yumnam Khemchand Singh’s govt.Protesters burned tyres and blocked roads in Kangpokpi district, and at least one group called for a shutdown in the hills.Nemcha Kipgen, who took the oath of office Wednesday over videoconferencing from Delhi’s Manipur Bhawan, is one of two tribal understudies to CM Khemchand Singh alongside Naga MLA Losii Dikho.KZC views Kipgen’s consent as “defiance of a collective mandate” not to be part of the govt until the Centre acknowledges the community’s long-standing demand for administrative separation from the Meitei-majority Imphal Valley.Joint Forum of Seven (JF7), a group of Kuki freedom fighters within Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s Azad Hind Fauz, called for a total shutdown on Friday across the state’s Kuki Zo-majority areas.A protest rally has been planned in Churachandpur.In Kangpokpi, roads littered with burning tyres signalled a return to unrest after a period of relative calm across the hills.

'Women MPs Near PM's Chair': Speaker Om Birla Reveals Why PM Modi Skipped Lok Sabha Speech

Absolute lie, says Priyanka; PM hid behind Birla, claims Rahul

NEW DELHI: Speaker Om Birla disclosed in Lok Sabha on Thursday that it was at his request that PM Narendra Modi had decided not to come to Lok Sabha to reply to the President’s address, as he had concrete information that protesting opposition members standing near Modi’s designated seat could pull off some “unexpected act”.“Had such an unpleasant act happened, then its sight would have torn the country’s democratic traditions to shreds,” he said amid protests from opposition MPs.Modi’s scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address was called off at last minute on Wednesday due to intense protest from opposition MPs, with some women members hovering near the PM’s seat ahead of his expected arrival.Many other members from Congress and regional parties were raising slogans in protest, including over BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s reference to several books carrying uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Birla said, “The whole country watched the incident yesterday as to how some women members reached there. It was not in accordance with the House’s dignity.”Birla also made it clear to the Opposition the House will not function “either today or tomorrow” if they continue bringing posters and pamphlets inside and asked them to express their views in line with parliamentary traditions.With the discussion on the motion thwarted since Monday over LoP Rahul Gandhi ’s insistence on referring to an unpublished book written by former army chief M M Naravane and Birla disallowing it, Lok Sabha passed the motion with a voice vote without Modi’s reply, a first since the NDA regime began in 2014, though not without precedence.Birla also voiced disapproval of opposition members’ vocal protest at his office — an apparent reference to their show of displeasure over Dubey’s speech — and slammed it as a “black spot” in parliamentary conventions. It has never happened that MPs bring their political differences to the office of speaker in such a manner.“It is in no way appropriate that the leader of the House (PM) could not speak.” He thanked Modi for accepting his request aimed at maintaining the House’s dignity.Congress on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of seeking cover behind the Speaker as it rubbished the Chair’s statement that the PM had skipped his scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks in Lok Sabha on Wednesday over fears that women MPs of Congress could trigger an unprecedented incident against the BJP mascot. It further said that Om Birla’s statement had been dictated by the Modi govt.Rahul Gandhi said, “Modi was so scared of the truth that he sought refuge in lies. Khair, jo uchit samjha, woh kiya (anyway, he did what he felt appropriate)” — the remark in Hindi being a sarcastic reference to what General MM Naravane has said was the PM’s stand during the Chinese aggression.Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “They are making the Speaker say all this because yesterday he (PM) did not have the guts to come to the house. Because three women were standing in front of his bench?”Priyanka asked what was so strange if women MPs were standing in front of the treasury benches. “There is no question of anyone raising any hand on the PM or trying to hurt him or any such thing. There is no question. It is an absolute lie.”With the ruling BJP castigating the Opposition for stalling PM Modi’s speech on the President’s address, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh recalled that on June 10, 2004, then PM Manmohan Singh was prevented by BJP from speaking on the Motion of Thanks. Ramesh posted on X Singh’s reply to the Motion of Thanks on March 10, 2005, where Singh starts his speech by saying that he had “waited out an entire year to perform this happy task” and thanked the President for the address of both 2004 and 2005.Ramesh said, “...we needed to put it on record that UPA PM Manmohan Singh was not allowed by the BJP to reply to the motion of thanks in 2004 even though the house had concluded the discussion on the motion, and only Singh’s reply remained.”","'Women MPs Near PM's Chair': Speaker Om Birla Reveals Why PM Modi Skipped Lok Sabha Speech.

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath Ignites Debate, Says ‘Political Islam’ Undermined Sanatan Faith

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday told officials any death in the state caused by banned Chinese kite strings (manjha) should be treated as murder.The CM’s directive comes after a sharp rise in Chinese manjha-related deaths in the state. At least eight people lost their lives in the state in past one year due to Chinese manjha.Asked how the directive will be implemented, additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Prasad said, “We are working on a legal and procedural framework to ensure any death caused due to the use of banned Chinese manjha is treated as a case of murder. Clear instructions will be issued to the police so that strict action can be taken against all those involved in its sale, supply or use.”The CM said Chinese manhja poses a deadly threat to citizens, especially children, as well as birds and animals. Chairing a high-level review, he asked how Chinese manjha is still being sold despite a ban. “This will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said, directing police chiefs to conduct district-wise raids, dismantle the illegal supply network, and ensure immediate seizure of the hazardous string.Yogi made it clear that if a person loses his or her life due to Chinese manjha, an FIR for murder will be registered and those responsible, including sellers, suppliers, and others involved, will face strict legal action and jail.","Yogi Adityanath told officials any death in the state caused by banned Chinese kite strings (manjha) should be treated as murder.

PM address in RS ‘poll rally speech’: Congress

NEW DELHI: A day after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee appeared in SC to argue against the special intensive revision of electoral rolls in her state, PM Modi on Thursday accused TMC of protecting “ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators)”.“Our colleagues from TMC spoke a lot. But they should introspect. Their merciless govt is creating new records of decline, and they are giving sermons here. Such a merciless govt is pushing the future of people into darkness... They only care about power. Even the most prosperous countries are pushing out illegal infiltrators. In our country, courts are being pressured to save infiltrators,” he said.Accusing Congress of nursing deep-seated hatred against him since he became Gujarat CM, Modi said Thursday that the party’s chant “Modi teri kabra khudegi (we will bury you)” was reflective of the hatred it harboured against him since he occupied the top job.Modi said the party’s frustration has been growing as he not only became PM, but has continued to be in office since 2014, while Congress considers the PM’s position its feudal fief.“So they think they have been left with only one option — to dig Modi’s grave,” he said. While Congress was engaged in politics of hatred, he was trying to lay the ground for a developed India, Modi said.The PM cited a host of measures his govt has taken — from repeal of Article 370 to peace and development initiatives in the Northeast and military action against terrorists sitting in Pakistan — to assert that Congress has increasingly become bitter towards him due to these developments.Congress on Thursday dismissed PM Modi’s address in RS as an “election rally speech” and said his self-obsession, fixation on “dialogue-baazi” and “demagoguery” were on full display.Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at the PM, saying “Modi ji was so afraid of the truth, he took refuge in lies. However, he did what he felt was right.” Party president Mallikarjun Kharge accused Modi govt of being determined to suppress the voice of opposition.Referring to the PM’s speech as “another election rally speech lasting 97 minutes”, Congress’ Jairam Ramesh said on X, “As always, it was overflowing with abuses and assaults, distortions and dramatics, innuendos and insults — and, of course, his usual quota of blatant and brazen lies. His self-obsession... and his fixation on dialogue-baazi and demagoguery was on full display”.Talking to reporters after opposition MPs staged a walkout during Modi’s reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address in RS, Kharge said the governing party was deliberately preventing opposition leaders from speaking in both Houses of Parliament.Kharge said abusive remarks were made against Nehru and Indira who sacrificed their lives for the nation.",PM Modi accuses West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee of protecting “ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators)” Accuses Congress of nursing deep-seated hatred against him since he became Gujarat CM.

'Sit And Protest': PM Modi Unfazed By Slogans, Takes Dig At Kharge As Opposition Walks Out Of RS

JAMMU: A bitter dispute over identity and regional recognition rocked J&K assembly for a second straight day after opposition leader Sunil Sharma of BJP dismissed the existence of the “Pir Panjal region” — triggering protests, walkouts and demands for an apology from lawmakers.CM Omar Abdullah said Thursday that Sharma’s remarks had “angered an entire region” and said it did not suit any politician to deride a region by questioning its name. Sharma had yet to apologise, he said.The row comes weeks after PDP president Mehbooba Mufti pitched for a separate administrative division comprising Rajouri and Poonch in Pir Panjal along with Chenab valley districts, citing remoteness, hilly terrain and lack of infrastructure — a demand BJP opposed.The region refers to the mountainous belt along the Pir Panjal range south of Kashmir valley and close to the LoC. Chenab valley includes Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban — rugged districts carved by the Chenab river. Both often complain they are sidelined between Jammu division and Kashmir valley in development, representation and administrative focus.The controversy began Tuesday when Sharma, who represents Padder-Nagseni in Kishtwar district, responded to a question on whether a proposed National Law University could be set up in Pir Panjal.He said there was no such region and that he had never heard the name “in any dictionary”. He later alleged the term was part of a political conspiracy by regional parties, echoing what he called the idea of a “Greater Kashmir”, which BJP would not allow.Sharma’s comments provoked protests from legislators from Rajouri and Poonch, including deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and forest minister Javed Rana, both from the area. They demanded an apology. Sharma refused.Independent legislator Muzaffar Iqbal Khan of Thanamandi in Rajouri district said Sharma’s statement has hurt public sentiment. “This is not just an insult to Pir Panjal but also to Chenab valley — Kishtwar and Doda,” he said. “We are border-area people. We have made sacrifices even during Operation Sindoor. In Poonch city alone, 16 people were killed. Those sacrifices have been insulted.”The protests resumed Thursday as lawmakers accused Sharma of reflecting “hatred” towards Pir Panjal and Chenab valley. Omar said criticism of a region by questioning its identity was unacceptable in a diverse Union territory.",Sunil Sharma of BJP dismissed the existence of the ‘Pir Panjal region’ The region refers to the mountainous belt south of Kashmir valley and close to the LoC.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

JAMMU: A high-powered Union home ministry panel has questioned Ladakh’s top political groupings on whether inclusion under the Constitution’s Sixth Schedule would offer sufficient safeguards, signalling that New Delhi is weighing constitutional limits, fiscal costs and governance models as demands for statehood gather force in the region.During talks Wednesday in New Delhi, the committee asked representatives of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Party (KDA) whether Sixth Schedule — framed for tribal areas in the Northeast — could serve as a constitutional shield for Ladakh, given that it falls under Article 368 and can be amended, sources said Thursday.Govt also sought clarity on the financial burden of granting Ladakh full statehood with a legislature, including salaries, provident fund liabilities and other expenditures for about 19,000 employees. Running a state or a Union territory with a legislature involves managing deficits and long-term fiscal responsibility, prompting the panel to press Ladakhi activists for detailed projections, the sources said.Sixth Schedule grants special protections over land, culture, and resources through autonomous councils. Since the 2019 bifurcation of J&K into two Union territories, Ladakhis have demanded similar safeguards and statehood.Senior BJP functionary Tashi Gyalson, who attended the meeting as former executive chairman of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, called the talks a step forward. “Talks were held for two-and-a-half hours and every member spoke,” he told reporters, saying discussions covered statehood, Sixth Schedule and the possibility of Article 370-type safeguards.“In broader terms govt indicated that Ladakh will get constitutional safeguards, that the region will be politically empowered, and that Ladakh will be developed as a sustainable model,” Gyalson said.LAB and KDA — umbrella groupings of political and religious organisations from Leh and Kargil — described the discussions as inconclusive. LAB co-chairman Chering Dorjay Lakrook and his KDA counterpart Asgar Ali Karbali said statehood for Ladakh and inclusion under Sixth Schedule — the two core demands — remained unresolved. Both expected another round of talks soon.Earlier, LAB and KDA met the home ministry panel in New Delhi on Oct 22, 2025.

‘Insensitive government in West Bengal’

‘Congress, Congress, Congress … and Assam’

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday unleashed a scathing attack on the opposition, with a special focus on rivals in poll-bound states of West Bengal and Assam At the receiving end were the Congress , which is the BJP’s principal challenger in Assam and a key contender for power in Kerala, and the Trinamool Congress , which is the saffron party’s arch political rival in West Bengal. The DMK, which rules poll-bound Tamil Nadu, also found a mention in the Prime Minister’s speech but there were no direct charges against the MK Stalin government.While the sharpest salvos were reserved for the Congress and the Gandhis, Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress came under attack for allegedly supporting the infiltrators.The Congress was quick to dub the Prime Minister’s address as “another election rally speech” and accused him of speaking lies.""Another election rally speech lasting 97 minutes in the Rajya Sabha today by the Prime Minister. As always, it was overflowing with abuses and assaults, distortions and dramatics, innuendos and insults -- and of course his usual quota of blatant and brazen lies,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on X.""His self-obsession and his fixation on dialogue-baazi and demagoguery was on full display,"" the Congress leader added.The Prime Minister called the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal “insensitive” and alleged that the ruling party was helping infiltrators. He took a jibe at Mamata Banerjee who herself appeared in the Supreme Court to argue in an ongoing case against the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in her state.West Bengal will vote to elect a new assembly in a month or two and the BJP is going all out to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress.""Our colleagues from the TMC spoke a lot... They should introspect... A merciless government that is creating new records of decline, and they are giving sermons here. Such merciless government is pushing the future of people into darkness,"" Modi said referring to the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government.""They only care about power... Even the most prosperous countries are pushing out illegal infiltrators. In our country, courts are being pressured to save infiltrators,"" he alleged.""How would the youth of the country forgive such people who are putting in efforts to fight the case of infiltrators? They are snatching the rights of our youth, their livelihood... tribal land. It endangers the lives of our sons and daughters... But they only care about power, and they are advising us,"" he lamented. Modi said they are ""blind"" to these problems being faced by the youth.The bulk of Prime Minister Modi’s speech was focussed on the Congress and the Gandhis including Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.The Congress was accused of insulting the President and hence the entire tribals and the women community, insulting a Sikh BJP leader Ravneet Singh Bittu and hence the entire Sikh community and finally insulting an Assamese acting Lok Sabha Speaker on chair and hence the entire Assamese people.Talking about disruptions in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said, ""Congress insulted the President. It's shameful...Yesterday in the Lok Sabha, a discussion could not be held on the President's address. It is an insult to the office of the President. Such people do not have the right to speak about the Constitution"".""You have insulted tribals, women, and the top post of India,"" he pointed out.""The incident that took place in the Lok Sabha is very painful. We can understand your frustration, but it was done in the temple of democracy. At that time, there was an MP from Assam in the chair, and papers were thrown at him. Is it not an insult to the northeast? Not an insult to the people of Assam?""He was referring to Dilip Saikia, a BJP MP from Darrang-Udalguri in Assam, and Krishna Prasad Tenneti, a TDP MP from Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh. Both are members of the Panel of Chairpersons in the Lok Sabha.Assam, like Bengal, will vote to elect a new assembly in some months and the Congress is going all out to defeat the BJP which has ruled the state for the last 10 years.With the entire opposition staging a walkout from Rajya Sabha after initially raising slogans against the Centre, the Prime Minister made the speech without any disruptions. The opposition claimed that the leaders of opposition (LoP) in both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha were not being allowed to speak, prompting them to stage a walkout.""Vipaksha ki awaaz nahi dabegi. Tanashahi nahi chalegi. LoP (Leader of Opposition) ko bolne do. (The opposition's voice can't be suppressed. Dictatorship cannot work. Let the LoP speak),"" the opposition leaders raised slogans as soon as the Prime Minister started to speak.

'Women MPs Near PM's Chair': Speaker Om Birla Reveals Why PM Modi Skipped Lok Sabha Speech

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday struck a mix of humour and sharp political attack as he revealed his ""health secret"" during his much-anticipated speech in the Rajya Sabha delivered amid sloganeering and a walkout by opposition members.Addressing the House, the Prime Minister said, ""...Someone once asked me, 'Modi ji, what is the secret of your good health?' I replied, 'Main daily do kilo gaali khata hun'.""He then went on to mount a strong offensive against the Congress, accusing it of decades of misgovernance and alleging that much of the NDA’s work over the past decade has been about ""correcting the mistakes of the past"".Further taking a dig at opposition slogans, the Prime Minister said, ""They say, ‘Modi teri kabr khudegi’. This is not merely a slogan but shows deep hatred towards me.""He also alleged that the opposition protects infiltrators and said the Congress believes the post of Prime Minister belongs only to a ""shahi parivar"".""The Congress party has always considered the citizens of this country as a problem. Once, Indira Gandhi visited Iran and, during a speech, quoted a conversation with her father, Nehru ji. I am quoting what she said, ‘When someone asked my father how many problems he has, he answered 35 crore.’At that time, the country’s population was 35 crore,"" he said.The Prime Minister also targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over comments made in the House a day earlier.Referring to him as the ""Yuvraj"" of the Congress, PM Modi said, ""What happened yesterday - the 'Yuvraj' of Congress who has 'shaatir dimag', called an MP of this House 'traitor'. His arrogance is at its peak. He did not call anyone else who has left the Congress a traitor. But he called the MP a traitor, because he is a Sikh. This was an insult to the Sikhs, an insult to the Gurus. This was an expression of the hatred for Sikhs that is filled in the Congress. ..""""He is a member of the family who sacrificed themselves for the country. Just because he changed his political ideology, he became a traitor? This is not a small word. How can the country tolerate a citizen being called a traitor?...This is highly unfortunate.

CHENNAI: The mysterious deaths of several crows in Chennai last month have been confirmed as caused by the H5N1 avian influenza.Following a TOI report on the unexplained crow fatalities in Adyar, the Tamil Nadu Animal Husbandry Department’s Animal Disease Intelligence Unit collected samples from the city in the fourth week of January and sent them to the ICAR-NIHAS laboratory in Bhopal. Tests confirmed the presence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, known for its zoonotic potential.The Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has written to the Tamil Nadu chief secretary confirming the H5N1 outbreak and urging the state to enhance biosecurity measures and disinfection, with civic bodies instructed to thoroughly disinfect areas where bird deaths were reported.The Union ministry has urged the state to report unusual mortality, intensify poultry surveillance and alert forest and wildlife departments. The ministry said the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) raises serious concerns, and has sought reports on cases, deaths, killed and disposed birds.Key instructions ban bare-handed contact with dead birds; handlers must wear gloves and wash thoroughly with soap and water. Veterinary staff should not perform field postmortems; instead, they must send carcasses to designated regional disease diagnostic laboratories.Officials emphasized safe disposal of either burning or burying dead crows and poultry at least 8-10 feet deep to prevent scavenging animals from spreading the virus. Forest department teams must conduct extensive checks in wooded areas for wild bird deaths.Following confirmation of the spread of H5N1 avian influenza, the state’s directorate of public health and preventive medicine issued a public health advisory on Thursday.“Transmission from birds to humans is extremely rare, except in cases where people touch carcasses with the live virus in them and then touch body parts such as mouth or eyes. There are not many such cases reported historically and there is no need to panic,” said director of public health Dr A Somasundaram.The department, nevertheless, asked people experiencing influenza-like symptoms such as fever, cough, cold, sore throat, or body pain to seek medical attention immediately. Poultry workers, bird handlers, and those who came into contact with dead birds were asked to remain vigilant and report any symptoms to the nearest govt health facility.The department also urged the public to report unusual bird deaths, maintain strict personal hygiene,avoid undercooked meat and raw or partially cooked eggs, to stay away from areas where bird flu was reported, and refrain from spreading rumours.GCC veterinary officer J Kamal Hussain said they have instructed sanitation workers to alert them of group-deaths of crows. ""We are identifying land for an 8-10feet burial. We have not reported many deaths in the last week,"" he said.The outbreak echoes similar H5N1 detections in Kerala and Bihar too. Globally, the World Health Organization reports 261 human infections from 2003-2024, mostly severe. In India, no human cases have surfaced, said Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, infectious diseases specialist at Apollo Hospitals. “It’s circulating abroad, but we’ve dodged it so far. Vigilance is key.”","The Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has written to the Tamil Nadu chief secretary confirming the H5N1 outbreak.

Heroism during a deadly Taliban attack

Years of advocacy led to approval

Who was Michael Ollis?





US President Donald Trump shared an emotional phone call with the parents of fallen Army Staff Sgt. Michael Ollis, informing them that their son would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic sacrifice in Afghanistan more than a decade ago.The call, recorded on video and shared by the SSG Michael Ollis Freedom Foundation, shows Trump speaking with Robert and Linda Ollis from their Staten Island home.When Robert Ollis admitted the couple was “very nervous,” Trump responded by delivering the long-awaited news: their son would receive the nation’s highest military honor.“There is no higher honor than the Congressional Medal of Honor,” Trump said, prompting visible emotion from Ollis’ father, whose expression shifted to pride and disbelief.Trump praised the fallen soldier’s bravery and told the parents their son would be “looking down” proudly. He also commended the family for spending years advocating to keep their son’s story alive, calling their persistence “fantastic.”Staff Sgt. Ollis was just 24 years old when he was killed on August 28, 2013, during a Taliban assault on Forward Operating Base Ghazni in eastern Afghanistan. During the attack, a suicide bomber detonated explosives near allied forces.Witnesses said Ollis threw himself between the bomber and a Polish army officer, absorbing the blast and saving the officer’s life. His actions are believed to have protected more than 40 service members and civilians on the base.Ollis was initially awarded the Silver Star, later upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross. Years of advocacy followed to elevate the recognition to the Medal of Honor.Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York confirmed the White House approved the award after sustained efforts by Ollis’ family, veterans’ organizations, elected officials, and the Staten Island community.The Medal of Honor is awarded only after a rigorous review process requiring battlefield documentation, sworn eyewitness testimony, and approval through the full military chain of command.Born on September 16, 1988, Michael H Ollis served with the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division. Known for his leadership and selflessness, he served alongside allied forces in Afghanistan at the time of his death.Several sites have since been named in his honor, including the SSG Michael H. Ollis Weapons Training Center at Fort Drum, New York, and a dining facility at Camp Kościuszko in Poland.President Trump has invited the Ollis family to the White House for the Medal of Honor ceremony, though an official date has yet to be announced.","US President Donald Trump shared an emotional phone call with the parents of fallen Army Staff Sgt.

Clues that broke the act

The chilling reminder of honeymoon murder





JAIPUR: What began as a routine post-dinner walk ended in a meticulously planned murder, executed barely three months after a young couple’s marriage.On the night of January 30, 27-year-old Ashish Kumar stepped out of his home in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar with his wife, Anjali, for their usual evening walk. It was a habit the couple followed regularly. Ashish never returned.As the two walked along a deserted stretch near their village, Anjali allegedly sent a pre-arranged signal. Hidden in nearby bushes were her long-time boyfriend Sanjay and his two friends, Rohit and Siddharth.Moments later, the three men allegedly ambushed Ashish, raining blows with sticks. When he failed to lose consciousness immediately, they strangled him with a muffler, ensuring he was dead, police said.To make the murder look like a robbery gone wrong, Anjali allegedly handed over Ashish’s mobile phone and her earrings to the attackers. She then lay near the spot, pretending to be unconscious.Police rushed the couple to the Rawla Community Health Centre after receiving information around 9 pm, but doctors declared Ashish dead on arrival.Investigators later uncovered that Anjali had been in a relationship with Sanjay for six to seven years, a fact known to her family.Despite this, she was married to Ashish in an arranged match on October 30 last year.Police said she remained unhappy after the wedding and wanted to pursue an MA degree in Sri Ganganagar, allegedly to stay close to Sanjay. Her husband opposed the idea, which deepened the resentment.According to investigators, Anjali shared her frustrations with Sanjay, and 16 days before the murder, the two met at her parental home in Sadulshahar, where they allegedly finalised the plan to kill Ashish.Initially treated as a robbery and murder, the case began to unravel during questioning. Call detail records, inconsistencies in Anjali’s version, and the post-mortem report raised red flags.Ashish, police noted, had joined work as a private school teacher just three days before his death.All four accused were arrested on Tuesday.Reacting to the arrest, Anjali’s uncle Ravi said the family was devastated. “If we had known a child from our family would turn out like this, we would never have allowed the marriage,” he said, demanding the harshest punishment.What police now describe as a cold, calculated conspiracy was carried out under the guise of an everyday routine — a nightly walk that Ashish trusted would bring him home safely.Raja Raghuvanshi travelled to Meghalaya with his wife Sonam for their honeymoon shortly after their marriage in May, 2025.Less than two weeks later, he was found dead in a remote area of the state.Investigators allege that Sonam conspired with her partner, Raj Kushwaha — a former employee and her lover at her family’s business — to murder Raja during the trip and stage it as an accident.Police said Raja was attacked with machetes by three men hired for the killing, while Sonam was present. His body was later dumped into a gorge, and his mobile phone was switched off to avoid detection.Sonam was traced several days later at a roadside eatery in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh, where she was detained. Kushwaha and the three alleged assailants have since been arrested, police said.","Ashish Kumar, 27, and his wife, Anjali, were ambushed by three men.

Timeline of the disappearance





Ransom notes and family plea

US President pledges support









Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, remained missing as the search for her entered its fifth day Thursday. Investigators said they had no proof she was still alive but continued to hope she was “still out there. ”Authorities believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her Tucson home against her will over the weekend. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said no suspects or persons of interest have been identified in the case.Investigators found blood on Guthrie’s porch and it was later confirmed it belongs to her.“Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,” Nanos said at a news conference, while acknowledging authorities had no proof she was OK.Investigators said the case had intensified as ransom notes sent to multiple media outlets were being treated as credible. Authorities also released a more detailed timeline from the hours after Guthrie was last seen.The notes demanded money with a deadline set for Thursday evening and a second deadline for Monday if the first was not met, said Heith Janke, the FBI chief in Phoenix. The messages also included details about a floodlight at Guthrie’s home and an Apple Watch.TMZ reported that a note sent to its newsroom demanded millions of dollars in bitcoin and described damage to Guthrie’s home that was believed to have occurred during her abduction. Authorities said it was unclear whether that description was accurate.“To anyone who may be involved, do the right thing. This is an 84-year-old grandma,” Janke said.Authorities said any decision on ransom demands ultimately rested with the family.Nancy Guthrie spent Saturday night eating dinner and playing games with family members before one of them dropped her off at her home in a well-to-do Tucson neighborhood, according to the sheriff.About four hours later, just before 2 am Sunday, the home’s doorbell camera was disconnected, Nanos said. Because Guthrie did not have an active subscription, the company was unable to recover any video footage.Minutes later, software data recorded movement at the home, though Nanos said the activity could have come from an animal. At 2.28 am, the app connected to Guthrie’s pacemaker was disconnected from her phone.Guthrie was reported missing shortly before noon Sunday after she did not show up at church.While she was able to drive, regularly attended church and was mentally sharp, the sheriff said Guthrie had difficulty walking even short distances and required daily medication that was vital to her health. During the search Sunday, a sheriff’s dispatcher said Guthrie had high blood pressure and heart issues.At least three media houses reported receiving ransom notes and turned them over to investigators. Authorities said an arrest was made after one ransom note was determined to be fake.One note emailed Monday to the KOLD-TV newsroom in Tucson included information that only the abductor would know, anchor Mary Coleman told CNN.In a video released by the Guthrie family Wednesday night, Savannah Guthrie struggled to hold back tears as she sat between her older siblings, Annie and Camron. She said the family was aware of the purported ransom letters and wanted to hear directly from whoever had taken their mother.“We are ready to talk,” Savannah Guthrie said in the video. “However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive, and that you have her.”Fighting back tears, Guthrie said the situation was becoming increasingly urgent.In a separate video posted on social media Thursday, Nancy Guthrie’s son Camron said the family had still not heard directly from the person or people responsible for her disappearance.“Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you,” he said. “We need you to reach out and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward.“But first,” he added, “we have to know that you have our mom.”President Donald Trump spoke with Guthrie by phone Wednesday and later said on social media that he had directed all federal law enforcement agencies to assist her and local police.“I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY. We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely. The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family. GOD BLESS AND PROTECT NANCY!” said Trump in a post on Truth Social.Nancy Guthrie is a retired communications professional and longtime volunteer who is often seen around her Tucson community, according to those who knew her. She lives in a quiet, wealthy area of the Catalina Foothills north of Tucson, where homes are spread across large lots and are not part of a gated community.","Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today’s” host Savannah, has been missing since Sunday.

A council meeting of Frisco, a city in Texas, turned into a battleground as the major issue at the meeting was the changing demography of the city, with the number of Indian-American people growing. The timing of the meeting was also crucial -- days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a freeze on H-1B hiring in state agencies and universities and Texas AG announced a probe into three H-1B firms. Ahead of the city council meeting, MAGA influencers rallied Frisco residents on social media to attend the meeting and speak about how they can't recognize their neighborhood because of the 'Indian takeover'.A number of people attended the meeting but they were not even Frisco residents, reports claimed.Frisco community social media channels were flooded with messages after the meeting was over. Frisco leaders condemned the targeting of the Indians -- some deleted their messages under pressure.John Keating, who is running for Frisco mayor, put out a bold message assuring protection of the Indian community in Frisco. ""Targeting members of our Indian community, or any community, is wrong, and it has no place in Frisco. Many of the individuals making these remarks were not residents; they came to divide, not to unite. To our Indian community, you are home in Frisco. You belong here. Your presence, your contributions, and your culture make our city stronger. You are valued, respected, and deeply appreciated,"" Keating wrote.""I heard comments that were deeply hurtful and completely unacceptable. As a veteran, I know the importance of standing up for what is right and defending the dignity of every person who lives here,"" he wrote.The post drew hate as people questioned why 33% of Frisco's population is India. ""I find it more hurtful that City Council members are supporting tyrannical corporations violating the United States Constitution but I guess that’s normal for all of you corrupted politicians. I’m not a resident of Frisco but I worked at a the largest private sector employer for Frisco and have every right to speak at your city. Your donations are next bud,"" Marc Palasciano, who spokes at the city council meeting too, wrote in comment.","A council meeting of Frisco, a city in Texas, turned into a battleground.

Vikas Nath, an Indian-origin businessman and owner of two Michelin-starred restaurants, has admitted to spiking a woman’s drink at an exclusive London nightclub in January 2024, according to court proceedings reported by the BBC.The incident took place on January 15, 2024, at Annabel’s in Mayfair, where staff members spotted Nath adding a substance to a woman’s margarita. The substance was later identified as gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a controlled Class B drug often referred to as a “date-rape drug” because of its severe effects when mixed with alcohol.While Nath has admitted to spiking the woman’s drink, he has denied doing so in order to have sex with her, claiming instead that he added the substance to help her “relax”.Nath also told jurors: ""What I did was wrong and I regret it very deeply.""According to court testimony, Nath is the director of the Michelin-starred Benares restaurant in Mayfair and owns several high-end restaurants in the UK and Spain. The woman told the court that she had met Nath five to six times prior to the incident and said he appeared genuinely concerned about her wellbeing, often inviting her out for drinks.She told the court that Nath had previously warned her about the risk of drinks being spiked. Describing him as “generous” and someone who always paid for their lunches, she said,“He came across as he cared for me and it was nice. I never thought he would have made a physical move on me so I felt safe with him.”On the night of the incident, Annabel’s staff noticed what they described as “rather strange actions” by Nath, who was alone at the table at the time. Staff members watched as he used a straw to take liquid from a bottle he appeared to be concealing before dripping it into the woman’s drink.After alerting senior managers, staff replaced the woman’s cocktail and later informed her that her drink had been spiked. The matter was subsequently reported to the police.Prosecutor Tim Clark told the court that Nath attempted to dispose of evidence before police arrived.“Prior to the police arriving, Mr Nath clearly worked out that he had been rumbled. He tried to hide the evidence of what he had done, going to the lavatory and throwing that little bottle into the cistern, and it was floating about whThe trial continues. en police recovered it,” Clark said, according to the BBC.In a police interview following the incident, Nath said he had obtained the gamma-butyrolactone as a cleaning fluid for a high-performance car and claimed a friend had told him it could also be consumed with alcohol as a “relaxant”. He told officers he was unaware that possessing GBL was illegal, admitting that he has himself used it that night as it heightened the effects of alcohol.The woman told the court she was initially so shocked by what she had been told that she attempted to defend Nath.“I remember vividly defending Mr Nath, saying ‘There is no way he could do that’. I remember sending him a message saying ‘I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening’. Because I felt it was my fault. I didn't want him in trouble, I didn't believe it,” she said.The trial continues.","Vikas Nath, an Indian-origin businessman, has admitted to spiking a woman's drink at an exclusive London nightclub in January 2024.

Anti-ICE sentiments at the Grammys 2026

Why does it matter?





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has responded to the anti-ICE remarks made at the Grammy Awards 2026 by celebrities with a scathing remark on their residences located within 'gated communities' and pointed out the 'millions of dollars' they spend on protecting themselves.On Tuesday, the 28-year-old addressed the reporters and called out all the celebrities who made any statements against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 'trying to demonise law enforcement'.“It’s very ironic and frankly sad to see celebrities who live in gated communities, with private security, with millions of dollars to spend protecting themselves trying to just demonize law enforcement, public servants, who work for the United States government to enforce the nation's laws,” she said after being questioned about her stance on the night filled with 'ICE OUT' pins and anti-ICE statements.Leavitt also called out these celebrities which include big names like Billie Eilish and Bad Bunny for not having the same type of uproar when the previous administration allowed people to enter the country illegally.""And you didn't hear this same type of uproar from celebrities in Hollywood when the previous administration allowed an invasion of our nation's borders and allowed innocent women and girls like Jocelyn Nungaray and Laken Riley to be killed and murdered at the hands of people who should have never been in our country in the first place,"" she added.Grammy Awards, one of the most coveted honours of the music industry took place on February 1, 2026 and were attended by the who's and who's of the musical world. As much as the night was about songs and artists, it also became a stage for numerous celebrities voicing out their concerns against ICE activities in the country and calling out the Trump administration for its agency.Bad Bunny who became the first artist in 67 years to win 'Album of the Year' for an entirely Spanish creation preceded his speech with an 'ICE out' bit. “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out... The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them. We love our people. We love our family and there’s a way to do it, with love, and don’t forget that,” he said.Additionally, Billie Eilish who grabbed 'Song of the Year' for her track 'Wildflower' also addressed the agency's acts saying: “As grateful as I feel, I honestly don’t feel like I need to say anything but that … no one is illegal on stolen land.”'Man I Need' singer Olivia Dean won her first Grammy in 2026 for 'Best New Artist' and has Jamaican-Guyanese roots also gave an emotional speech. “I’m up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant. I’m a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated,” she said.Other celebrities who did not make speeches donned 'ICE OUT' pins on their outfits for the night. Justin and Hailey Bieber made a silent but loud nod to the statement that was voiced out from the arena, by wearing the white pins on their black ensembles. Not just new generation, established legends also stood in support with Joni Mitchell wearing the pin while accepting her award for 'Best Historical Album'.The Grammy Awards are one of the most celebrated nights of the music world. From new popstars to rock legends, all were in attendance joining hands to celebrate the works of art that pierce hearts through the ears.But this year, the event didn't just celebrate art, it became a centre-stage for its power of expression and enlightenment. Celebrities not only used their words, but also took help from the subtle cues of fashion to acknowledge that while they lead different lives from those of their fans and listeners, they are aware of their trials and tribulations and standing in solidarity with them.Since the beginning of 2026, ICE activities in US have heightened to lead to the fatal shooting of two Minneapolis residents, detention of kids and deportation of families. From mayors to singers, everyone has called for the Trump administration to step in, if not in the name of law, then humanity at least.",The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has responded to the anti-ICE remarks made at the Grammy Awards 2026 by celebrities.

What is the SAVE Act ? Here are key things to know

What suporters and critics say





A recent CNN polling analysis suggests that voter identification requirements enjoy wide public backing in the United States, cutting across party lines and racial groups.According to data cited by CNN’s chief data analyst Harry Enten, more than three-quarters of Americans consistently say they support requiring a photo ID to vote, with similar levels of support recorded over several years.The polling shows that 83 per cent of Americans supported photo ID requirements in the most recent survey, broadly in line with figures dating back to 2018, which ranged from the mid-70s to low-80s.Support was strongest among Republicans, at 95 per cent, but a substantial majority of Democrats, around 71 per cent, also favoured voter ID laws.CNN’s breakdown by race showed similarly high levels of approval. About 85 per cent of White respondents supported photo ID requirements, along with 82 per cent of Latino respondents and 76 per cent of Black respondents. Enten noted on air that the issue does not show the sharp partisan or racial divisions often associated with other election-related debates.The renewed attention to voter ID has been amplified by public comments from entertainer Nicki Minaj, who questioned why voter identification remains a subject of political debate in the US. CNN presenters pointed to polling data to argue that public opinion is largely settled in favour of requiring identification at the polls.The findings have fed into a broader political conversation around election integrity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Former president Donald Trump has suggested nationalising certain election standards, while Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation that would expand identification and citizenship requirements for voters in federal elections.At the centre of the current debate is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, sometimes referred to as the SAVE America Act. The legislation was introduced by Republican Representative Chip Roy of Texas, with a companion bill sponsored by Senator Mike Lee in the Senate.The SAVE Act would require individuals to provide documentary proof of US citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Acceptable documents would include a US passport, a birth certificate, a certificate of naturalisation, or similar official records. In most cases, the bill requires these documents to be presented in person at the time of registration.The updated version of the bill, reintroduced in early 2026, also adds a requirement for voters to present a valid photo ID when casting a ballot in federal elections.In addition, it directs states to use federal databases to identify and remove non-citizens from voter rolls and establishes criminal penalties and civil liability for election officials who register voters without the required documentation.Supporters of the SAVE Act argue that the measures are necessary to reinforce public confidence in elections and ensure that only eligible citizens can vote. They maintain that uniform national standards would close gaps in the current system.Critics, including Democrats and voting rights groups, counter that voting by non-citizens is already illegal under federal law and occurs extremely rarely. They warn that strict documentation requirements could prevent eligible citizens from registering, particularly those who do not have ready access to passports or whose birth certificates do not reflect name changes due to marriage or court orders.The bill does not include federal funding to help states implement the changes, a point election administrators have raised as a concern. As Congress continues to debate the proposal in 2026, voter ID and proof-of-citizenship requirements remain a key flashpoint in the wider discussion on election access and integrity.","A recent CNN polling analysis suggests that voter identification requirements enjoy wide public backing in the United States. More than three-quarters of Americans consistently say they support requiring a photo ID to vote, with similar levels of support recorded over several years. The findings have fed into a broader political conversation around election integrity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127914249,imgsize-27436,width-400,resizemode-4/127914249.jpg"

Conservative podcaster Candace Owens on Thursday amplified internal turmoil at Turning Point USA (TPUSA) by sharing a 12‑minute video of a former employee who claims she was terminated for questioning the organisation’s new direction under CEO Erika Kirk — widow of late TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk.Owens wrote on X, “One of the fired employees from Turning Point USA speaks out about the organisation’s new direction!” and introduced Aubrey Laitsch, who worked at TPUSA for four years.In the clip, Laitsch says she was let go nearly three weeks ago and that an executive was reportedly told by an Uber driver that someone inside TPUSA, later presumed to be her, had criticised Erika Kirk, the new CEO, and the organisation.She denied the claim and described her relationship with Erika Kirk as neutral, saying they had known each other since 2013.Laitsch did not allege this incident was explicitly used as a reason for her firing, but said she “felt” she was dismissed because she questioned the official narrative surrounding Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University on September 10.“I just have a gut feeling that I was terminated from Turning Point because I am questioning the narrative of what happened to my role model and CEO, Charlie Kirk on the day of his assassination,” she said.The former employee said she believed her scepticism about the widely reported version of events played a role in her dismissal.Owens has repeatedly questioned the official account that 22‑year‑old Tyler Robinson killed Charlie Kirk, suggesting alternative scenarios involving a possible wider plot and internal betrayal, though authorities have charged Robinson with aggravated murder.This comes following the backlash Owens faced earlier after comedian Bassem Youssef appeared on her show in late January, where they discussed leaked audio of Erika Kirk and her behaviour in a staff call, a clip that went viral and fuelled further criticism online.TPUSA has not publicly commented on Laitsch’s claims. As the feud intensifies, the conservative media sphere remains sharply divided over the organisation’s leadership and the narratives circulating about its founder’s death.",Conservative podcaster Candace Owens amplified internal turmoil at Turning Point USA (TPUSA) She shared a 12‑minute video of a former employee who claims she was terminated for questioning the organisation’s new direction under CEO Erika Kirk.

The Brooklyn community is reeling after the gruesome discovery of Michelle Montgomery, a 39-year-old mother of four, whose dismembered remains were found inside a plastic bag in the trash compactor at the Borinquen Houses in Bushwick on Sunday morning.Montgomery, a devoted mother and Amazon overnight worker, was last seen leaving her home on Saturday night in high spirits, according to her husband, Anthony Echevarria. ""She left this house vibrant, happy and alive,"" he told reporters, describing a seemingly normal evening out.Family members said she had gone out with friends and posted a TikTok video just after midnight, showing her dancing and enjoying herself.

Massie leads bipartisan push for Epstein files transparency

Massie has also gained attention for his bipartisan campaign to release government records related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, he authored the

Epstein Files Transparency Act

, signed into law in November 2025, mandating the Justice Department to release nearly all records on Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

The lawmakers have accused the DOJ of violating the law by delaying releases and heavily redacting documents. In a January 30 letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Massie and Khanna requested a special master to review unredacted records, arguing that Congress cannot properly oversee the department without complete access.

While the Justice Department says its recent release of over three million pages marks compliance, Massie continues to face criticism, including from Trump, who called the Epstein files a “Democrat hoax.”

The Kentucky congressman remains defiant, posting on social media: “It was not a hoax, I cannot be bullied, I am not done, and this is why those in power are doing everything in their power to defeat me.”





Massie, a libertarian-leaning lawmaker, has often opposed Trump-backed legislation, including major tax and spending measures, and has challenged presidential authority on military action without congressional approval.Trump has endorsed Massie’s GOP primary challenger, retired Navy SEAL Ed Gallrein, and urged Republicans to unseat the incumbent.Reacting to Trump’s remark, Massie wrote on X, “The President of the United States called me a moron at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning because I’m still fighting for what he promised the American people: Reduce big spending, DOGE, no new wars, end foreign aid, defend 1A 2A 4A, prolife, and expose sex traffickers.”","President Donald Trump publicly slammed Republican Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

Immigration attorney Brad Bernstein offered five simple tips to students looking for visas for higher studies in the US at a time when the US authorities are weighing every visa request carefully and rejecting more than ever, citing various reasons. Bernstein said the applicants must show strong ties to their homecountry so that the officers are convinced that the applicants are intent on going back to their countries after their course is over in the US. The State Department is taking extra caution for cases where they have reasons to believe that an applicant wants to settle down in the US.All student visa applicants are presumed to have an immigrant intent, which means they would like to live in the US indefinitely. But given the present situation, an applicant must show a non-immigrant intent to the interview officer.""So if they ask you, if your studies are over, do you plan on working, and you say 'yes I would love to get a work visa and ultimately a Green Card', your visa will be denied,"" Bernstein advised.The second tip to remember, Bernstein added, is to ensure financial documents to prove that the applicant has enough funds to sail through student life in the US and the family back home can support themselves.""Make sure you speak English. You shouldn't be picked up at the airport by your illegal alien brother and finally have a positive attitude,"" the attorney said.The US is not issuing student visas to a number of countries, citing security reasons. Countries which are on the list of complete travel ban are not eligible for student visas now, unless there are some exceptions. People from Afghanistan, Burma, Burkina Faso, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen – and to individuals traveling on any travel documents issued or endorsed by the Palestinian Authority, are not allowed to travel to the US on any visa, including student visa.

From campaign war room to permanent digital base





Former US Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has unveiled a new media initiative, Headquarters, reviving and rebranding the popular KamalaHQ social media accounts more than a year after her election defeat to Donald Trump, calling it the “new Gen-Z led progressive content hub. ”Announced on Thursday, the project is a partnership with liberal advocacy group People For the American Way, founded by legendary television producer Norman Lear.The initiative aims to “mobilise pro-justice, pro-fairness, pro-democracy young people against far-right extremism,” according to the organisation.The rebranded platform will operate across X and TikTok, where the former KamalaHQ accounts boast a combined following of over 6 million, and will expand to YouTube, Substack and other digital platforms.On X, the newly renamed handle @headquarters_67 cheekily notes in its bio, “Elon wouldn’t give us @headquarters,” while the TikTok handle is simply @headquarters.In a launch video posted on X, Harris described Headquarters as a space to stay informed and engaged.“It’s where you can go online to get the latest of what’s going on, and also to meet and revisit with some of our great and courageous leaders — elected leaders, community leaders, civic leaders, faith leaders, young leaders,” she said.“I’m really excited about it. Stay engaged, and I’ll see you out there.”Harris will serve as chair emerita of Headquarters in an honorary capacity and will not have editorial control. Content and programming decisions will be handled by the Headquarters team and the leadership of People For the American Way.Several members of the original KamalaHQ team are returning for the new venture. The project will be advised by Rob Flaherty, former deputy campaign manager for Harris’s 2024 campaign, along with Parker Butler and Lauren Kapp, who led KamalaHQ. Arlie Shugaar will join People For the American Way as director of platforms.“Conservatives build permanent organising infrastructure. Progressives often dismantle theirs after Election Day,” said Svante Myrick, president of People For the American Way. “Headquarters is the end of that cycle.”The relaunch also comes amid speculation about Harris’s future in public life, following her nationwide tour last year to promote her memoir, 107 Days, during which she hinted she was not done with public service.","Kamala Harris revives KamalaHQ social media accounts with People For the American Way.

Hammam mein sab…: Why Donald Trump remains untouched by the Epstein files (so far),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-epstein-files-bill-gates-elonmusk/articleshow/127945470.cms,"



There’s a Hindustani proverb that states: Hammam mein sab nange hain. The phrase refers to public bathhouses common in Persian, Mughal, or Ottoman societies. The phrase’s literal translation is: In a bathhouse, everyone is naked. The idea is that there’s no point pretending behind a veil of hypocrisy because, when the judgement comes, we are all found wanting; when appearances are stripped away, we all stand equally exposed.Nowhere has this phrase been more well epitomised than by the Epstein files, which have stripped away the carefully crafted angelic halos that PR agencies had built up for public figures. Every person of note in the WENA (Western Europe and North American) society as we know it appears to have been on a first-name basis with Jeffrey Epstein There’s spiritual guru Deepak Chopra explaining that “God isn’t real but cute girls are,” following that up with an apology that has done more harm than good. Noam Chomsky is in there , the Devil’s Accountant and master linguist, lamenting over the “hysteria that has developed about abuse of women, which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime worse than murder,” while trying to explain to his dear friend Jeffrey how to deal with the fallout.The man who taught us about manufacturing consent was instead helping Epstein manufacture narratives.Keir Starmer’s former ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, is in there asking Epstein for favour s, with the Labour regime at least showing that they are equal-opportunity protectors when it comes to child grooming. Bill Gates makes an appearance, the global messiah of vaccines seeking an antibiotic treatment for his then wife Melinda because he had got an STD from Russian party girls. Elon Musk also makes sporadic appearances, happily wondering when he can come to the island to chill and showing his inability to decipher creep code, in the process becoming perhaps the only person who looks dorkier on the other side of the revelations.But quite surprisingly, the one who has looked most neutral, even angelic, is Donald J. Trump, whose arrival had been treated as the second coming of Lucifer Morningstar by the American media.Even with all the redactions—and the DOJ must be running out of black tape—there’s nothing in the Trump material that makes him look like the monster we were promised.Trump appears in the Epstein files in a strangely spectral way. His name is everywhere, but his voice is nowhere. He shows up in third-party emails, in interview notes, in calendars, in contact lists, and in messages where other people discuss him as a destination, a favour, or a point of access.Trump appears as a setting—Mar-a-Lago—as a brand, as a person others want proximity to, but never quite as an author whose words can be pinned down. Even when he is mentioned in investigative summaries or unverified tips, those references remain second-hand and legally inert. In a cache overflowing with emails, Trump’s absence as a sender or recipient is as conspicuous as his omnipresence as a reference. Perhaps it’s out there, withheld by the regime, but as of now, we have nothing.In fact, there isn’t a single email exchange between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, who seemed to be emailing much of the Western hemisphere.Many Democrats thought the Epstein files would finally be something they could use to nail Trump, but it has instead made older Democratic leaders look bad. The one in hot water—literally and figuratively—is former president Bill Clinton.And perhaps that explains the Trump phenomenon better than anything else.To borrow lines from Dave Chappelle’s old SNL monologue, no one had ever seen a white male billionaire screaming that the system was rigged because he was inside it, and proudly stating that he didn’t pay any taxes because “crooked” Hillary couldn’t change the tax code as it benefited “her friends.”The American media establishment didn’t know how to deal with that sort of unvarnished truth then, and it still doesn’t now. Trump has always shown the unique Bart Simpson-like ability to not pay for his sins—surviving bankruptcy and even the full might of the American justice system—and coming back from political exile. Even Napoleon failed to manage that.Even today, he has moments of complete disassociation and goes into streams of consciousness rants that can only be described as logorrhoea, and pays no consequence, unlike Biden, whose re-run was felled by his diminishing mental and physical acuity.He can accept gifts openly from foreign governments, create parallel international institutions, threaten opponents and allies, encourage foreign actors to improve his family’s relationship with Mammon, and still walk away without any political price.Most scandals that could fell previous governments simply slip off the Donald’s (pun intended) back.Hammam mein sab nange hain, and the Epstein files have stripped everyone bare, exposing hypocrisies, double lives, and carefully maintained illusions. But Trump has always behaved as if he were proverbially naked, a reality star through and through.There was never a halo to strip away, no performance of moral purity to dismantle.For others, the curtains removed from the bathhouse have been devastating. For Trump, it barely registers. In a room where everyone is finally exposed, the man who never bothered pretending stands oddly untouched, even sanctified.","Every person of note in the WENA (Western Europe and North American) society as we know it appears to have been on a first-name basis with Jeffrey Epstein.
