Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: Security forces have busted three terror hideouts during an ongoing joint operation in J&K’s Kathua district, officials said Friday. The first hideout was busted in Kamad Nallah area on Jan 8, while two more were discovered in Billawar, about 80km away, on Friday.A massive cordon-and-search operation has been underway in the region — spanning Kamad Nallah, Kalaban, Dhanu Parole, and Billawar — since Jan 7 to track and kill fleeing terrorists, based on intelligence inputs and reported sightings of terror suspects. A brief gunfight had erupted between troops and ultras in the forested belt of Najote on Jan 7, following which the operation was intensified over the past week.“During the searches in Kamad Nallah, holed-up terrorists opened fire at the troops, triggering a gun battle that lasted through the night. Subsequently, one terrorist hideout was detected early on Jan 8, from where security forces recovered two empty M4 cartridges, a plastic box containing desi ghee, a polythene packet of almonds, hand gloves, a cap, a blanket, a tarpaulin sheet, a small pouch and a polythene bag,” a police spokesperson said.The operation continued, and the cordon was expanded to cover over a dozen villages and surrounding areas, with additional troops and reinforcements rushed in.On Friday, two more hideouts were busted in Billawar’s Kalikhad and Kalaban areas. “The recovery included a cooking gas cylinder, cooking oil, charger wire, hand gloves, cooking and eating utensils, an empty oil gallon, large plastic bags, a torch, blankets, containers and wrappers of eatables, along with other miscellaneous items,” the spokesperson said.Kathua SSP Mohita Sharma said the operation was still underway.","Security forces have busted three terror hideouts during an ongoing joint operation in J&K’s Kathua district.

NEW DELHI: Questioning the legal shield granted to serving and former chief election commissioners (CEC) and election commissioners under a new law, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa on Friday described the provision as an “extraordinary protection. ”“I am not aware of any comparable protection available to other public institutions or public servants. In a democracy, accountability is paramount, and therefore this kind of legal shield, in my view, should not exist. Even if a right decision has been taken, it must still stand the test of being defended before a court of law,” Lavasa said on the sidelines of a panel discussion on accountability for the Election Commission (EC).The Supreme Court has agreed to examine a plea challenging the immunity granted to the chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners under the CEC and EC Appointment Act, 2023.The petition contends that the provision confers “unprecedented, unbridled power” on the CEC and election commissioners by granting them permanent, blanket immunity from both civil and criminal proceedings, even in cases of alleged misuse of office.Clause 16 of the law states that no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner for any act, deed or statement committed, done or spoken while acting, or purporting to act, in the discharge of official duties or functions.Lavasa, who was appointed as one of two election commissioners in January 2018, resigned in August 2020 to join the Asian Development Bank (ADB). He drew national attention in 2019 after recording a dissenting opinion in a panel decision on complaints against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then BJP president Amit Shah during the Lok Sabha election campaign.","The Supreme Court has agreed to examine a plea challenging the immunity granted to the chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners under the CEC and EC Appointment Act, 2023.

"Medical condition of Harish Rana worse than Aruna Shanbaug’s, SC told; court reserves verdict after hearing govt, family members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-condition-of-harish-rana-worse-than-aruna-shanbaugs-sc-told-court-reserves-verdict-after-hearing-govt-family-members/articleshow/126569919.cms,"NEW DELHI: Comparing it with the case of Aruna Shanbaug, who spent 42 years in a vegetative state, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati on Thursday told the Supreme Court that the medical condition of Harish Rana, who has been in a vegetative state for the last 13 years, is worse than hers and favoured his plea for passive euthanasia Appearing before a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan, Bhati, who is appearing for the Centre, said that Shanbaug's eyes would respond, and she also used to move her lips to lick sugar. But Harish has been in a state of complete inertness. His eyes do not move, nor respond to danger.Advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, appearing for Harish, submitted that he has been in an irreversible and incurable state with 100% disability since the accident, with no hope of recovery.The court should proceed to make a final decision on withdrawing his life support system, she said.The court reserved its order after hearing both the sides. This is the first case of its kind when the apex court will decide a plea for passive euthanasia since it legalised the same.Shanbaug, a nurse who spent 42 years in a persistent vegetative state after being raped, died in 2015. She was left with severe brain damage and paralysed after the 1973 attack by a ward attendant in the Mumbai hospital where she worked.A plea was filed by a writer in SC seeking removal of her life support system, but the hospital staff, who were taking care of her, strongly opposed the plea and the court did not allow it. Passive euthanasia had not been legalised in the country at that time, happening only after the apex court’s verdict in 2018.Bhati had told the bench earlier that she had had a talk with the team of doctors, i.e., members of the Primary Board as well as Secondary Board, who examined Harish, and they were of the opinion that continuation of medical treatment was not in his best interest and that, in the given circumstances, nature should be allowed to take its course. ""The doctors are also of the opinion that Harish would remain in this permanent vegetative state (PVS) for years to come, with tubes inserted all over his body. However, he would never be able to recover and live a normal life,"" she told the bench.As per the procedure framed by SC on passive euthanasia, the decision to withdraw the artificial life support system can be taken only after the primary and secondary medical boards concur on the issue. In this case, both the boards are one on withdrawing Harish’s life support system, and the final call now has to be taken by the apex court.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor of his paying guest accommodation on Aug 20, 2013, while he was pursuing a B.Tech degree at Punjab University. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.","Harish Rana has been in a vegetative state for the last 13 years.

Navid Afkari’s execution after protests shows the deadly cost of dissent in Iran

Navid Afkari dreamed of wearing Iran’s colors at the Olympics. Donald Trump tried to save his life and Dana White begged publicly for mercy. Still, in September 2020, the Iranian state hanged the 27-year-old wrestler. His death shocked the sports world and sent fear through a nation already hurting.If life had been fair, Afkari would have been training, traveling, and chasing medals. Instead, he was killed by the same country he loved after joining street protests. Iranian officials said he was guilty of murder. Afkari said again and again he was innocent. Human rights groups said his trial was unfair. What happened next showed how dangerous it can be to speak up in Iran.Afkari grew up in Shiraz, a city known for poetry and culture. Wrestling is Iran’s proudest sport, and Afkari was good at it from a young age. By 17, he was in a national camp. By 23, coaches saw him as a future Olympian. To support his training, he worked as a laborer during the day and trained whenever he could. His rise made him famous, and that fame later made him a target.In 2018, Iran faced large protests over rising prices and strict rules.Afkari joined those protests. Soon after, he and his two brothers were arrested and accused of killing a security guard. Afkari said he was tortured into a false confession. Amnesty International called his trial “grossly unfair,” saying he was not allowed a proper defense.Despite global anger, the courts sentenced Afkari to death. One charge was murder. Another was “waging war against the state” for protesting. His brothers received long prison terms, with one spending around 1,000 days in solitary confinement. Afkari’s claims of torture were never properly checked.On September 12, 2020, Afkari was hanged in Shiraz. His family was not allowed a final visit. The execution was rushed. United Nations later said the killing appeared to be used as a warning during growing unrest.Before his death, Afkari recorded a message from prison. He said he had faced many opponents in wrestling, but none as unfair as the system holding him. He said he was innocent and asked people not to forget him.Iran’s power system leaves little room for protest. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has final control. Online spaces are tightly watched, and many platforms are blocked. Journalist Masih Alinejad later said Afkari became a hero after death, not because he wanted fame, but because he spoke up.Trump and White both appealed publicly. Trump posted on Twitter asking Iran to spare Afkari’s life, linking to Fox News. White released a video saying Afkari was a human being and deserved mercy. Their efforts failed.After Afkari’s death, his grave was damaged many times. According to Iran International, officials even tried to control his headstone to stop it becoming a protest site. Years later, fear still surrounds those who speak out. Afkari’s story shows how little has changed, and how high the price of protest remains.Also Read: Olympic Swimmer Ryan Lochte Moves In With Girlfriend And Her Three Kids As Blended Family Grows Amid Divorce And Custody Battle",Iran hanged wrestler Navid Afkari at 27 after protests ignoring pleas from Donald Trump and Dana White.

Indian truck driver Sukhdeep Singh faces deportation after running red light; had licence despite living in US illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-truck-driver-sukhdeep-singh-faces-deportation-after-running-red-light-had-licence-despite-living-in-us-illegally/articleshow/126566595.cms,"



Running a red light has landed Indian truck driver Sukhdeep Singh at risk of deportation from US after authorities found he was in the country illegally.A routine traffic stop in Arizona turned serious when local police pulled over Singh for allegedly running a red light and a stop sign.According to authorities, Singh is an Indian national who was unlawfully present in US. This was confirmed by agents from the Border Patrol after running a brief check, even though Singh had a California commercial driver’s licence.He was taken into custody in the town of Quartzsite and is now being processed for deportation under 8 USC 1182, the section of US immigration law dealing with inadmissible non-citizens.The United States Border Patrol, Yuma Sector, confirmed the incident in a post on X: ""Quartzsite police pulled over Sukhdeep Singh after he ran a red light and a stop sign. Officers contacted Blythe Station Border Patrol agents who determined Singh is an Indian national that was illegally in the United States, despite being in possession of California commercial driver’s license. Singh will be processed for deportation under 8 USC 1182.Border Patrol officials said Singh’s case is not the only one that involves commercial truck drivers without legal immigration status present in US. Earlier operations by agents at the Blythe Station led to the arrest of six undocumented Indian nationals in separate incidents. In each case, the individuals were working as truck drivers and held commercial driving licences despite being in the country unlawfully.It was reported that all six were processed for deportation, and later lost the opportunity to legally re-enter the United States.Authorities also advised the undocumented individuals to voluntarily self-deport using the CBP Home app. This option allows people to leave the country on their own and may help preserve their eligibility to legally return to US in the future.For the last few months, California has been facing federal scrutiny for issuing thousands of commercial driver’s licences to non-citizens, including some without lawful status, in apparent violation of federal rules. The US Department of Transportation has revoked about 17,000 licences, withheld funding and tightened eligibility, saying states must verify immigration status for commercial licences. Most of the truck drivers are from India. The Trump administration blames the Biden-era rules that allegedly allowed thousands of immigrant truck drivers to attain a commercial license without proper english proficiency and formal legal procedures.","Sukhdeep Singh was stopped for running a red light and a stop sign in Arizona.

PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar used his political acumen to challenge the BJP on his home turf in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad but the civic election results on Friday showed that he failed to make a dent.Though the verdict is not impressive for Ajit Pawar, political observers said it has opened new pathways for him to lead a united NCP, as merger possibilities look stronger now with the weakening of the Sharad Pawar-led NCP group at the grassroots.The day the municipal corporation polls were announced on Dec 15, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis declared that there would be no alliance between the BJP and the NCP in most of the 29 civic bodies.Although the NCP fielded candidates in most municipal corporations, party chief Ajit Pawar concentrated on the elections in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, focusing on regaining the bastion he lost to the BJP in 2017. He aligned with his estranged uncle Sharad Pawar’s NCP, but the alliance proved too weak to dislodge the BJP in both the municipal corporations in Pune district.Observers said the NCP’s strength revolves only around Ajit Pawar, while the organisational structure on the ground was already dented by the BJP.Political analyst Parimal Maya Sudhakar told TOI , “Ajit Pawar took on the BJP during his campaign, but he did not have foot soldiers to fight his party's battle. He struggled to get candidates and ended up fielding some people with a criminal background.”The solace for the deputy CM was the alliance that he forged with NCP (SP) helped him gain acceptance among his uncle Sharad Pawar’s supporters. In contrast to the political situation that prevailed after July 2023, where they turned on Ajit Pawar for engineering a split in the party formed by Pawar and joining the Mahayuti, this time they accepted his leadership in the alliance. While most of NCP (SP)’s senior leadership stayed away from campaigns, Ajit Pawar led the canvassing for both the parties.Political observers said that the election also helped Ajit Pawar gain acceptance from Sharad Pawar's supporters for a possible merger. “Though both parties have been claiming that the alliance was only for the municipal council polls, it helped them reduce the bitterness and created a mindset of working together. The only positive that Ajit Pawar can take from this election is that his leadership will be accepted by the other group if they come together,” Sudhakar said.There is a silver lining for the NCP even though it finished as a runner-up in both civic bodies. With the Congress rapidly losing its ground in both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, the NCP can work towards garnering Congress’s secular vote bank before the 2029 elections.",Ajit Pawar used his political acumen to challenge the BJP on his home turf in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.

Second U.S. Operation In Venezuela? FAA Makes Big Caribbean Airspace Announcement Post-Maduro Op

The Mexican government said there has been no impact on civil aviation or airspace operations in the country following a notice issued by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities said national airspace remains fully operational and that there are no restrictions or changes affecting Mexican airlines or aviation operators.""There is no impact whatsoever on civil aviation in Mexico, nor any changes to operating conditions in national airspace. There are no operational implications or restrictions for Mexico, nor for Mexican airlines or operators, after FAA NOTAM,"" the Mexican government said, as cited by Reuters.The US federal aviation administration earlier said on Friday that it had issued a series of aviation safety advisories urging airlines to exercise caution when flying over parts of Central America and South America, citing potential military activity and the risk of GPS signal interference.The US aviation authority issued multiple alerts warning of a “potentially hazardous situation” and urging operators to “exercise caution” while flying through airspace over Mexico and Central America due to “military activities.”The FAA said the warnings were issued through multiple Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) covering Mexico, several Central American countries, Ecuador, Colombia, and portions of airspace over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The advisories took effect on Friday and are set to remain in force for 60 days.The Federal Aviation Administration said it released flight advisory Notices to Airmen covering specified areas of Mexico, Central America, Panama, the Bogota, Guayaquil, and Mazatlan Oceanic Flight Regions, as well as airspace over the eastern Pacific Ocean.Tensions between the United States and regional leaders have intensified since the Trump administration carried out a major military buildup in the southern Caribbean, launched an attack on Venezuela, and captured President Nicolas Maduro during a military operation. Trump has since suggested that further military actions in the region are possible, including against Colombia.Following the operation in Venezuela, the US Federal Aviation Administration restricted flights across much of the Caribbean, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of services by major airlines. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford told Reuters this week that there had been close coordination between the agency and the US military ahead of the Venezuela operation.Trump has also indicated he is considering ground-based military strikes against drug cartels in Mexico, a move that would represent a highly provocative action against a US neighbor and major trading partner.“We are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump was quoted as saying by Fox News last week.",The Mexican government said there has been no impact on civil aviation or airspace operations in the country following a notice issued by the US Federal Aviation Administration.

US President Donald Trump on Friday offered to mediate the long-running dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the sharing of Nile River waters. He stated that Washington is ready to restart talks to find a lasting and fair solution.In a letter written to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and later posted on Trump’s Truth Social account, the US president said he was prepared to renew American mediation efforts amid rising tensions linked to Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).The Nile dispute has intensified since Ethiopia inaugurated the GERD on September 9. Egypt, which lies downstream, has strongly opposed the project, arguing that it threatens its water security. Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous country with more than 120 million people, views the $5 billion dam as central to its economic development and electricity generation plans.In his letter, Trump also praised Sisi’s regional role.“I thank you for your leadership in successfully mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. I recognize and admire your steady role in managing the many security and humanitarian challenges that have faced this region, and your own people, since October 7, 2023.This war has weighed heavily on Egyptians, not just their neighbors, in Israel and Gaza,” Trump wrote.Trump stressed that no single country should dominate the river’s resources, writing that the United States “affirms that no state in this region should unilaterally control the precious resources of the Nile, and disadvantage its neighbors in the process.”He added that US-led efforts could help secure predictable water flows during droughts while allowing Ethiopia to generate power from the dam.“I believe that with the right technical expertise, fair and transparent negotiations, and a strong United States role in monitoring and coordination between parties, we can achieve a lasting agreement for all Nile Basin Nations,” Trump said.Trump also warned against the risk of escalation, saying: “I very much hope that this truly understandable dispute over the GERD (DAM!) will not lead to major military conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia.”Egypt which is home to around 107 million people, depends on the Nile for nearly all of its fresh water, which is critical for households, agriculture and power generation at the Aswan High Dam, according to BBC.Ethiopia has confirmed it has completed filling the reservoir at the GERD, a massive hydroelectric project on the Blue Nile that officials say will help bring electricity to millions and boost economic growth.","US President Donald Trump offered to mediate the long-running dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the sharing of Nile River waters. The Nile dispute has intensified since Ethiopia inaugurated the GERD on September 9.

How Desmond Scott met Marissa Springer after Kristy Scott filed for divorce





Desmond Scott surprised many people this week, and his name is once again making headlines for a very personal reason. Just days after his estranged wife Kristy Scott filed for divorce, Desmond Scott was seen sharing a close moment with an unknown woman in Houston. At first, no one knew who she was, and that mystery quickly caught attention online.Now, that question has been answered. According to TMZ , the woman seen with Desmond Scott has been identified as Marissa Springer, a 24-year-old Houston model and business student. Sources say the two had just met that same night, and things moved quickly after a short conversation and a few drinks.This new detail comes at a sensitive time, as Kristy Scott had already filed divorce papers in Harris County, Texas, in December. The filing cited alleged infidelity, which Desmond Scott later addressed publicly. While the moment raised eyebrows, sources close to the situation say there was no hidden plan and no long-term connection involved.Sources familiar with the situation told TMZ that Desmond Scott met Marissa Springer for the very first time last Sunday night at Sante, a bar in Houston. The meeting happened through a mutual friend, and Marissa Springer reportedly had no idea about Desmond Scott’s online fame or recent personal troubles.More importantly, sources say Marissa Springer believed Desmond Scott was single at the time they met. There was no expectation of anything serious, and no discussion about his marriage or divorce during their first meeting.As the night went on, the two connected quickly. With drinks involved and a relaxed setting, the mood shifted faster than expected. Sources described it as a sudden spark rather than something planned. Even so, it remains unclear whether the moment will lead to any future contact between them.Earlier this month, TMZ reported that Kristy Scott officially filed for divorce in December, pointing to alleged infidelity in her court documents. After the news became public, Desmond Scott responded by admitting he made “choices” he said he was “not proud of.” His statement did not go into detail but acknowledged regret over his actions.For now, those close to the situation say this moment was brief and does not signal a new relationship. Still, the timing has kept Desmond Scott in the spotlight, as questions around his divorce and personal life continue to draw attention.Also Read: What Happened Between Kristy Scott And Desmond Scott As TikTok Couple Files Divorce Over Alleged Infidelity Claims","TikTok star Desmond Scott's mystery woman revealed as Houston model Marissa Springer.

Jack Doherty court case takes new turn after cocaine mention at January 15 hearing





Jack Doherty is once again in the news, but this time, it is not because of a viral video or online stunt. The popular American YouTuber and streamer is facing serious legal trouble after an arrest in Florida that could change his career. In mid-November 2025, Miami Beach Police arrested Jack Doherty after an incident where he was filming content that allegedly blocked traffic on a busy road. Officers say the situation became unsafe, which led to his arrest on the spot.Following the arrest, police filed three charges against him. These included possession of a controlled substance, possession of 20 grams or less of marijuana, and resisting arrest without violence. Because one of the charges is a felony, Doherty was facing the risk of several years in prison if convicted. Now, new updates from his January 15, 2026 court hearing have raised even more questions, especially after the streamer did not attend the hearing himself.YouTuber Atozy, who is well known for covering streamer court cases, attended Jack Doherty’s hearing in person. After the hearing, Atozy shared an important detail that surprised many followers.According to Atozy, Jack Doherty did not appear in court. He explained this after speaking with an attorney present at the courthouse. Atozy quoted the attorney directly, saying:“Apparently, he was allowed by the judge to not show up or to waive his attendance because of his ‘celebrity status.’ That’s what the attorney I talked to said.”During the hearing, the judge only discussed two charges, not all three. One major update stood out. Earlier police reports said the controlled substance involved was amphetamine or Adderall. However, the judge stated that Doherty was allegedly in possession of cocaine instead.Atozy explained why this matters, saying:“This does technically make things a little bit worse for him because cocaine is a Schedule II compared to Adderall, which is a Schedule III.”This change is serious because cocaine is treated more strictly under the law. If confirmed, it could increase the risk of tougher punishment for the streamer. As of now, the trial is still ongoing, and the next court date has not been announced.Outside the courtroom drama, Jack Doherty’s name also appeared in headlines after a reported backstage fight involving his team and former UFC champion Andrei Arlovski at the Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua event. No official charges were announced related to that incident.Also Read: Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy Faces Possible Deportation To Russia After Philippines Arrest And Court Penalties","Jack Doherty was arrested in November 2025 for allegedly blocking traffic on a busy road.

Minority Under Fire Hindu Teacher Home Burnt In Bangladesh Sparks India Concern Ahead Of Polls





DHAKA: The house of a Hindu schoolteacher was set ablaze by a mob in Bangladesh's Sylhet district, as violence against minorities continues ahead of the Feb 12 parliamentary elections in the country. Birendra Kumar Dey and his family members, residents of Bahor village, had a narrow escape. Nobody was injured in the incident on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.Since the lynching of garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das on Dec 18, eight from the minority Hindu community have died in incidents of atrocities, while properties - including houses and land - attacked, grabbed or set on fire. Rights groups have reported at least 51 incidents of violence against Hindus.Bahor villagers said members of the Dey family, including the elderly, were inside the house when it was set on fire. They escaped with the help of locals, villagers said, adding that Birendra was a popular teacher and people lovingly called him 'Jhunu Sir'.Meanwhile in the UK parliament, lawmaker Bob Blackman Thursday raised concerns over escalating violence against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh. Calling the situation ""disastrous"", he said minorities are being murdered, their houses and temples set ablaze. He also said the polls in Bangladesh are being held amid grave democratic concerns.","The house of a Hindu schoolteacher was set ablaze by a mob in Bangladesh's Sylhet district.

Brussels Tightens Iran Sanctions As Eu Chief Von Der Leyen Vows Support For Protesters And Change

Iran linked to past plots and threats against Trump





Iranian state television aired footage on Sunday that included a threat directed at US President Donald Trump, following his recent warning of potential military action against Iran’s leadership.The footage showed a mourner at a ceremony for Iranian security personnel killed in recent unrest holding a placard with an image of Trump, referring to the assassination attempt he survived at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2024. Text in Farsi beneath the image read: ""This time it will not miss the target"".The incident represents Tehran’s most direct threat against Trump to date, coming after his repeated warnings that the United States would strike Iran if it continued its crackdown on anti-government protesters.Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot in the ear by a gunman identified as Thomas Crooks.The footage was aired on the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network (IRINN), a state-controlled television channel. It was broadcast during a funeral ceremony in Tehran for more than 100 members of the security forces and others described by authorities as “martyrs” killed during recent demonstrations.At the ceremony, attendees held banners reading “Death to America!” while others carried photographs of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is widely regarded as being close to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported that the funeral marked the first in a series of state ceremonies planned for security personnel in the coming days, as cited by The Independent.Rights groups outside Iran have said that more than 150 members of the security forces and government personnel have been killed during over two weeks of unrestIranian authorities have characterised the demonstrations as “riots” and accused protesters of carrying out “acts of terror”.Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes. Iranian officials have also repeatedly vowed to kill Trump following his order to assassinate General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, in January 2020.A video released in 2022 by Iranian state-linked media depicted a simulated assassination attempt on Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf course ahead of the 2024 election.The video resurfaced after the arrest of Ryan Routh, who was detained while allegedly attempting to take aim at Trump at the same golf course, as cited by the New York Post.The US Justice Department has also said that in 2024 it disrupted an Iranian-directed plot to kill Trump, following the arrest of Farhad Shakeri, who court documents say was tasked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps with carrying out the killing.The current protests broke out in Iran on December 28 after the collapse of the rial, amid economic pressure linked to international sanctions imposed in part over the country’s nuclear programme.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi gave a different account in an interview with Fox News, saying the protests began peacefully and that authorities initially engaged with demonstrators. He said the unrest later turned violent after what he described as “terrorist elements led from outside” Iran became involved.","Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes.

Trump ‘STEALS’ Machado's Nobel Medal, Brands It Reward for ‘Work Done’; Move Seals New Caracas Plan?





US President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for presenting him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal, an award she was conferred months ago.In a post after receiving the medal, Trump took to Truth Social, calling Machado a “wonderful woman.” “It was my great honor to meet María Corina Machado , of Venezuela, today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you, María!” he wrote.Machado said she presented Trump with her Nobel medal “as a recognition of his unique commitment to our freedom.” After the meeting, she told supporters that the interaction had gone well and that they could “count on” the US president.A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.However, days ago, the Nobel Committee and institute clarified on the permanence of a Nobel laureate's status. It announced that the prize can not be revoked, shared, or transferred to others.The meeting came just days after Trump launched strikes on Venezuela under Operation Absolute Resolve, which led to the toppling of President Nicolas Maduro and his capture along with his wife, who were taken into US custody thereafter.The US raid in Caracas on January 3 had briefly raised hopes among Venezuela’s embattled pro-democracy opposition, led by Machado, who had called for an “end to tyranny” in the country.However, Trump soon sidelined Machado after the US kidnapped Maduro, arguing that she lacked both domestic support and the respect needed to lead the country.Venezuela’s opposition maintains that Maduro rigged the 2024 election to deny victory to Machado’s party, allegations that have been backed by Washington.On Thursday, the White House said Trump’s view of Machado remains unchanged.","US President Donald Trump met with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

US Senate Hearing Turns Viral After Indian-Origin Doctor Refuses Yes Or No On Men Getting Pregnant

Who is Dr Nisha Verma ?





Dr Nisha Verma has drawn national attention after a tense exchange during a recent US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on abortion pill safety.During the hearing, Republican Senator Josh Hawley repeatedly questioned Verma on whether men can get pregnant, a line of questioning that quickly went viral on social media and reignited wider political and cultural debates around gender identity, reproductive rights and the language used in healthcare.Verma, who appeared as a Democratic witness, declined to give a direct yes-or-no answer and described the questioning as “polarizing”, saying she treats patients “with many identities”. Hawley responded by asserting that “it is women who get pregnant, not men.”The exchange has since fuelled sharp reactions online and among policymakers, with the debate likely to shape future discussions on abortion policy, transgender healthcare and the regulation of medication abortion in the US.Dr Nisha Verma is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and a complex family planning subspecialist.She was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, to Indian immigrant parents.She completed her Bachelor’s degree in Biology and Anthropology and her medical degree at the University of North Carolina, and later earned a Master’s in Public Health from Emory University.She trained in obstetrics and gynaecology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and completed a Complex Family Planning Fellowship at Emory University.According to Emory University, she is an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Emory University School of Medicine.Dr Verma currently serves as Senior Advisor for Reproductive Health Policy and Advocacy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), as per AcademyHealth.She provides reproductive healthcare in states including Georgia and Maryland, has testified before Congress on abortion restrictions, and is involved in research examining the impact of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban on high-risk pregnancies.",Dr Nisha Verma has drawn national attention after a tense exchange during a recent US Senate hearing on abortion pill safety.

Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity





President Donald Trump this week marked the ceremonial renaming of a roadway near his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, a move that adds yet another entry to a growing list of public-facing projects, institutions, and initiatives bearing his name since he returned to office in January.State lawmakers approved an honorary new name for a stretch of Southern Boulevard, the road that connects Palm Beach International Airport to Mar-a-Lago. The route is frequently used by the president’s motorcade when traveling between the airport and his residence.Speaking at an event held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he was “tremendously honored” by the decision. “I’ll remember this amazing gesture for the rest of my life,” he said.Local officials stressed that the change is symbolic. County commissioners told local media outlets that official addresses, emergency response systems, and government maps will remain unchanged.The renamed roadway is only the latest, example of Trump attaching his name to state-backed or federally linked projects while still in office, a practice historians note is highly unusual in Washington, where presidential naming honors typically come years or decades after a president leaves power and are usually authorised by Congress.The Palm Beach roadway now carrying Trump’s name runs directly to Mar-a-Lago, underscoring its personal significance. While the designation is honorary, it places Trump alongside a small number of living presidents whose names appear on public infrastructure during their lifetime.In December 2025, the White House announced that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be renamed the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. The decision was approved unanimously by the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees, which had been selected by Trump. The move triggered backlash in the arts community, with several performers withdrawing in protest, according to coverage by major US media organisations.On December 4, 2025, the Trump administration renamed the US Institute of Peace to the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace. The state department said the change was meant to “reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history.” The new name was installed on the building near the state department. The institute was originally created by Congress in the 1980s, a fact noted by historians and critics cited in national reporting.In December 2025, Trump announced plans for a new fleet of Navy vessels dubbed Trump-class battleships. The first ship, the USS Defiant, would belong to what the Navy described as “a class of American-designed battleships that will be the most lethal surface combatant ever constructed.” Forbes reported that the USS Defiant would be the biggest warship the US has built since World War II, while also noting expert criticism that such ships could be vulnerable to modern missile attacks.During his second term, Trump unveiled tax-advantaged savings and investment accounts for children, branded as Trump Accounts. According to PBS News, the accounts are “tax-advantaged savings accounts available for every American child up to the age of 18, and parents can put in up to $5,000 annually.” Children born between 2025 and 2028 automatically receive $1,000.The White House also rolled out redesigned national park passes featuring Trump’s face, in one version alongside George Washington, and in another showing Trump saluting. Newsweek reported that the passes were “reintroduced as part of a broader rebranding effort by the administration.”Trump announced a proposed investor visa known as the Trump Gold Card, which would offer a fast-track path to residency and citizenship for foreign nationals willing to pay at least $1 million USD to the US government.In October 2025, the administration introduced TrumpRx, a government-backed platform allowing Americans to purchase prescription drugs at discounted prices directly from pharmaceutical companies, according to White House briefings and national media reports.The Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, or TRIPP, is a US-backed infrastructure corridor connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave via Armenia. The project, expected to be finalised in early 2026, aims to reduce Russian and Iranian influence in the South Caucasus while promoting trade and regional stability, according to diplomatic reporting.Some historians quoted by US media outlets have described the naming spree as a superficial attempt to cement Trump’s legacy, one that could prove temporary if future administrations reverse course. For now, however, Trump Boulevard joins an increasingly long list of places where the president’s name is quite literally written into the landscape.","President Donald Trump this week marked the ceremonial renaming of a roadway near his private club in Palm Beach, Florida.

UNITED NATIONS: The US stands by the ""brave people of Iran,"" and President Trump ""has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter,"" US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the UN Security Council on Thursday.Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the protests against clerical rule. But on Thursday, Trump adopted a wait-and-see posture, saying he had been told that the killings were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions.""President Trump is a man of action, not endless talk like we see at the UN. He has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter,"" Waltz told the security council meeting, which Washington had requested. Waltz dismissed allegations by Iran that the protests are ""a foreign plot to give a precursor to military action."" ""Everyone in the world needs to know that the regime is weaker than ever before, and therefore is putting forward this lie because of the power of the Iranian people in the streets.They are afraid. They are afraid of their own people,"" Waltz said.Iran's deputy UN ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi said Iran does not seek escalation or confrontation and accused Waltz of resorting ""to lies, distortion of facts, and a deliberate misinformation campaign to conceal his country's direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence."" ""However, any act of aggression - direct or indirect - will be met with a decisive, proportionate, and lawful response,"" he said.Russia's UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia accused the US of convening the UNSC to ""justify blatant aggression and interference in the affairs of a sovereign state"" and threats to ""solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed to overthrow an undesirable regime.""","The US stands by the ""brave people of Iran,"" and President Trump ""has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter,"" US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz said.

Gaza War Not Over For IDF? 22,000 Israeli Troops Face Mental Health Crisis; PTSD Hits Hard





US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the appointment of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former British prime minister Tony Blair as founding members of a new Gaza “board of peace.”Trump also named his special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga to the seven-member “founding executive board,” the White House said in a statement. Trump himself will chair the board, with additional members expected to be announced in the coming weeks.Blair’s appointment is seen as controversial in the Middle East due to his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. Trump said last year he wanted to ensure that board members were “acceptable choice[s] to everybody.”The announcement follows Thursday’s unveiling of the board, a key phase two element of the US-backed plan to end the war in Gaza. Trump described the board as the “Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place.”The creation of the board comes shortly after a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee was announced to manage day-to-day governance in post-war Gaza. Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath will head the committee.Trump also named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to lead the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza.The US-backed Gaza peace plan first went into effect on October 10, resulting in the return of hostages held by Hamas and a cessation of hostilities between the Palestinian militant group and Israel. The second phase of the plan is now underway, amid reports of aid shortages and ongoing violence.Hamas has not publicly committed to full disarmament, a key demand from Israel.","US President Donald Trump announced the appointment of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former British prime minister Tony Blair as founding members of a new Gaza “board of peace” Trump also named his special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in- law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga to the seven-member executive board.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126597282,imgsize-1390065,width-400,resizemode-4/article-95.jpg"

Second U.S. Operation In Venezuela? FAA Makes Big Caribbean Airspace Announcement Post-Maduro Op





The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday said that it issued a series of aviation safety warnings, advising airlines to exercise caution while operating over Central America and parts of South America due to the risk of potential 'military activity' and GPS signal interference.The agency said it released multiple Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) covering Mexico, several Central American nations, Ecuador, Colombia and sections of airspace over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The advisories came into effect on Friday and will remain valid for the next 60 days.The US aviation authority posted multiple messages warning of a “potentially hazardous situation,” and to ""exercise caution"" in the airspace over Mexico and Central America due to ""military activities"". ""The FAA issued flight advisory Notices to Airmen for specified areas of Mexico, Central America, Panama, Bogota, Guayaquil and Mazatlan Oceanic Flight Regions, and in airspace within the eastern Pacific Ocean,"" said an FAA spokesperson, as quoted by AFP.The FAA’s action comes amid rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and several global leaders, amid a significant US military buildup in the southern Caribbean.The Trump administration recently conducted military operations targeting Venezuela, including an operation in which Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was seized. President Donald Trump has also publicly indicated that further military action remains under consideration, including potential operations involving Colombia.Last week, Trump claimed that drug cartels were effectively controlling Mexico and suggested that the US could carry out strikes on land targets to counter organised crime groups. The remarks were among several recent statements pointing to an increased willingness by Washington to deploy military force in the region.In the aftermath of the Venezuela operation, the FAA restricted commercial flights across parts of the Caribbean, prompting major airlines to cancel hundreds of services.

President Donald Trump is not concerned about his immigration policies, but he expressed some discomfort over the way it looks, especially in Minneapolis, where US citizen Renee Good was shot dead by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on allegations that Renee Good was trying to run the ICE agent over. Both protests and ICE crackdowns are going on simultaneously as the administration is resolute to boot out the Somalis living off government welfare in Minnesota.Citing an insider, Axios reported that Trump wants deportations, mass deportations. ""What he doesn't want is what people are seeing. He doesn't like the way it looks. It looks bad, so he's expressed some discomfort at that. There's the right way to do this. And this doesn't look like the right way to a lot of people,"" the adviser said.The report said insiders are now planning to do something to change the optics as chaotic scenes from Minnesota are playing around the clock on TV and social media. An internal GOP polling alarmed some Trump advisers and those polls were even before Renee Good's shooting. 60% of independent voters and 58% of undecided voters said Trump was ""too focused"" on deporting illegal immigrants, the poll viewed by Trump's team found.33% said Trump was primarily deporting law-abiding people, as opposed to criminals. Two public surveys released this week — one from CNN, another from YouGov — found that most Americans said the agency was making US cities less safe.US citizen Renee Good was shot dead on January 7 by an ICE agent and the administration claimed it was act of 'self defense' as Good was coming at the agent with her car. This triggered a massive controversy as videos showed that Good was turning her car away and her last interaction with an ICE agent on that day was not heated.After Good's shooting as the crackdown continued, a video of a woman being dragged by ICE agents from her car in Minneapolis went viral. Bangladeshi-origin Aliya Rahman, a US citizen, said she was on her way to a medical appointment when she was detained by immigration officers. The administration accused her of obstructing ICE agents.Due to a heavy police presence in the school area at St Louis Park, several schools suspended in-person classes. “This is not how Minnesotans behave. This is not how St. Louis Park residents behave,” said St Louis Park Mayor Nadia Mohamed, the first elected Somali American mayor in the country.","US citizen Renee Good was shot dead on January 7 by an ICE agent and the administration claimed it was act of'self defense' as Good was coming at the agent with her car.

The ongoing legal dispute between Hunter Biden and the mother of his daughter has taken another sharp turn.New court papers filed urged an Arkansas judge to have former US President Joe Biden 's son arrested for failing to provide proper child support.34-year-old Lunden Roberts and the mother of Hunter’s 7‑year‑old daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, filed the motion on Tuesday. In the filing, she asked the court to reopen the long‑running case and consider incarceration for Biden until he complies with the 2023 agreement, according to court records.“Incarcerate him in the Independence County Detention Center as a civil penalty until he purges his contempt by complying with this court’s orders,” the motion read. Roberts said in the filing that previous measures have been ineffective and that jail time is necessary.The dispute comes from a 2023 settlement that reduced Biden’s monthly child support obligation from $20,000 to $5,000. As part of that agreement, Roberts agreed to drop her request for their daughter to take the Biden surname and to accept proceeds from a number of Biden’s art sales for their daughter’s benefit.Roberts accuses Biden of failing to meet other terms of the agreement, including regular payments and communication, and of inflicting “emotional trauma” on their daughter. In one example cited in court documents, Navy Joan allegedly felt upset when she attended a family wedding and realised her father would not take part in the event in the way other family members did.The motion also argues that the court should modify the child support amount, and that Biden’s income has changed significantly since the 2023 order and that Navy Joan does not have access to the same lifestyle as her half‑siblings.Hunter Biden has previously acknowledged paternity after a 2019 court‑ordered DNA test confirmed he is the father of Navy Joan.

Trump Warns ‘Professional Agitators’ With Insurrection Act As Minneapolis Erupts After ICE Shootings





US President Donald Trump said on Friday there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests against immigration raids in Minnesota, a day after he warned he could use the law.“If I needed it, I would use it. I don't think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the measure, which permits the deployment of soldiers on US soil.This marks a tone-down from when the president had raised the possibility of deploying the military to the northern state for law enforcement purposes amid demonstrations against wide-ranging immigration operations led by his administration. “If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump had said in a post on Truth Social earlier.Protests in Minneapolis have seen crowds clash with immigration officers attempting to detain undocumented migrants, with some officers responding forcefully.Federal agents discharged their weapons in two separate incidents, wounding a Venezuelan man on Wednesday and killing an American woman last week.An AFP correspondent also witnessed officers roughly pulling a woman from her car on Tuesday, as the federal presence in the state continued to expand. Supporters of stricter immigration enforcement have since confronted opponents, leading to further tense encounters.Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of carrying out “a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota,” in a video posted on X on Wednesday night.The Insurrection Act allows a president to bypass the Posse Comitatus Act to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence,” authorising the use of the armed forces “as he considers necessary” to enforce the law.","Donald Trump says there is no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests against immigration raids in Minnesota.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a fresh warning targeting Green Card applicants and cited recent cases where layers of screening threw up shocking discoveries about the applicants and appropriate actions have been taken. In one case, the USCIS said, screening revealed that an applicant was wanted for homicide by the Mexican government.In another incident, a Canadian with a pending Green Card application in the US was arrested at his immigration interview when it was discovered that he had recently been charged with drunk driving and then caused injury to an officer resisting arrest.""Green cards are for those who follow the law, not those who break it,"" the USCIS said in one message. ""Crime doesn't lead to a green card, it leads to arrest and removal,"" another message said.Green Card applications are being most closely watched by the immigration as Green Cards are the first step to getting US citizenship, which also comes with welfare benefits like Emergency Medicaid. After five years as a Green Card holder, immigrants can avail of Medicaid, food stamps in some cases and can also apply for naturalization.The new warnings from the USCIS came as the State Department paused all immigrant visas from 75 countries, to be effective from January 21. The ban will continue until the administration conducts a reassessment of how much government support these nationals are receiving while living in the US. The visa pause does not impact travelers or students unless their countries are already on the travel ban list.The list of the 75 countries on Green Card pause includes: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a fresh warning targeting Green Card applicants.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday said Iran’s leadership had called off the executions of hundreds of protesters arrested during a recent crackdown, thanking Tehran for the move.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Iranian authorities had cancelled scheduled hangings that were to take place a day earlier. “I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran.

Tehran had reportedly planned mass executions of protesters before reversing the decision.The death toll from the protests continues to climb, according to activists. However, President Trump suggested that the likelihood of US military action was diminishing, citing Iran’s decision to halt planned executions.Trump’s optimistic assessment contrasted with the more complex realities on the ground in Iran, but it appeared to mark a retreat from his earlier remarks that had implied a US strike could be imminent.Previously, Trump had posted about Iran and the protesters, saying, “Help is on the way.” When asked on Friday whether that promise still stood, he responded, “Well, we’re going to see.”Pressed on whether anyone had persuaded him to step back from what seemed like threats of military action, Trump said, “Nobody convinced me.

The death of a man held at a federal detention camp in Texas in early January may be investigated as a homicide after the local medical examiner reportedly found the preliminary cause was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”.Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July last year, was pronounced dead on 3 January. He was in ICE custody at Camp East Montana, a tent camp at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Washington Post reported.In a press release about his death, ICE claimed he died after “experiencing medical distress” and said his cause of death was under investigation. The Department of Homeland Security had previously highlighted Lunas Campos’s arrest as one of the “worst of the worst”, a category used by DHS to trumpet what they claim as victories of Trump’s mass deportation campaign. He had convictions of child sexual abuse, possession of a firearm, and aggravated assault.However, in a recording reviewed and first reported on by the Washington Post, the El Paso county’s office of the medical examiner reportedly told a member of Lunas Campos’s family that the office was preparing to classify the death as a homicide, subject to results of a toxicology report.Lunas Campos was one of four ICE detainees who died while in custody in the first 10 days of the year and his death was part of a trend in which 2025 was the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades. According to a Guardian investigation, last December was the deadliest month, with six fatalities.He was also at least the second person housed at the camp, which has repeatedly come under fire from human rights groups for reports of abuse and inhumane conditions, to die in recent months. Francisco Gaspar-Andres, a 48-year-old Guatemalan man who had also been held at Fort Bliss, died in hospital after health complications late last year.ICE officials and the county of El Paso’s medical examiner could not be reached for comment on whether Lunas Campos’s death would be officially classified as a homicide. A representative of the office responded to the El Paso Times saying that the autopsy report was still pending and not publicly available.ICE said in its press release that Lunas Campos had been put into segregation after he became “disruptive while in line for medication”. Officials said staff “observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance”. Medical responders pronounced him deceased at 10.16pm.Witnesses detained with Lunas Campos told the Washington Post a different account. Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained at the camp, said he saw five guards choking Lunas Campos as he struggled after resisting being taken to the segregation unit because he did not have his medications.During the struggle, Jesus Flores said he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he could not breathe.“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” Flores told the Post.","Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July last year, was pronounced dead on 3 January.

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.
