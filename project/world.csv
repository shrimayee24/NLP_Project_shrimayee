"Video: Man throws liquid on former CM Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, held by security",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/video-man-throws-ink-on-former-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-during-padyatra-held-by-security/articleshow/115843860.cms,"NEW DELHI: A man identified as Ashok Jha threw some liquid on former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday, during his padyatra in Delhi’s Greater Kailash area.The individual was apprehended by Kejriwal’s security personnel, who managed to overpower him before the situation escalated further.According to the police, Jha, serving bus marshal at Delhi Transport Corporation's Khanpur Depot, has been detained.The AAP questioned the law and order situation after the attack and said, ""If a former CM is not safe in the capital, where will the common man go? Delhi is facing a complete law and order breakdown under BJP’s rule.""Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Saturday alleged that the man wanted to set Kejriwal afire after throwing spirit on him during his Padyatra campaign. In a post on X, Bharadwaj also alleged that the attacker was connected with the BJP.This latest incident follows a similar attack in October, when AAP claimed that Kejriwal was targeted during a rally in Delhi. The party accused the BJP of orchestrating the attack by mobilizing its supporters to disrupt the event.Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva said that the incident was a 'political drama' orchestrated by Kejriwal ahead of Delhi elections. Sachdeva told ANI, ""I have been saying since day 1 that Arvind Kejriwal will get himself slapped and get things thrown at him. As per the information, it was just water and the person is their local worker. He has been caught in an intoxicated state. This is a political drama. This is disappointment and hopelessness. Nothing is working now so they are making such cliche moves.""Responding to the incident, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said, ""Whenever a leader goes for a Padyatra, he comes in a very close proximity with the people. Hence, such incidents happen even after strong security. But it is the mistake of that person. He should have asked his question instead of doing this. The people are enraged because the streets are broken, drains are overflowing and the pollution level is high.""This attack is not the first of its kind that Kejriwal has faced. Back in 2016, the AAP leader was targeted with ink during a visit to Bikaner, Rajasthan, where he had attended a condolence meeting for a local AAP leader.Since his political debut in 2013, Kejriwal has faced several similar attacks.With just months left before the Delhi Assembly elections, AAP has ramped up its efforts to engage voters and strengthen its grassroots support. Kejriwal, along with senior party leaders, is actively participating in padyatras across the city, reaching out to constituents and discussing the party's agenda. These foot marches are part of the second phase of a broader strategy designed to bolster AAP's presence ahead of the polls.Kejriwal, while campaigning on Friday, announced that registration for the Rs 1,000 monthly honorarium for women under the ‘ Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana ’ will begin soon. He also accused the BJP of failing to provide essential services like uninterrupted electricity, quality healthcare, and good schools, despite governing in 22 states across the country.","Ashok Jha, serving bus marshal at Delhi Transport Corporation's Khanpur Depot, has been detained.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Forget motels, fast food franchises, and corner stores. A Patel may soon be running the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), one of the most powerful offices in the United States.President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday named Kashyap (""Kash) Patel, a middling staffer in his first term, to serve as the next Director of the FBI, calling him ""a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.""Recognising the ""pivotal role"" Patel played in uncovering what Trump calls the "" Russia Hoax ,"" the President-elect described his nominee as ""an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,"" who would ""end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the Border... to bring back Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity to the FBI.""Not everyone, including many Republicans who see him as a conspiracy-peddling MAGA wingnut, shared the glowing sentiments. High-ranking officials in Trump's first term in the White House who balked at Patel's rise from an obscure prosecutor bristled at a promotion that was inevitable after Trump's hand was strengthened by an resounding electoral win, resulting in the MAGA supremo virtually ousting incumbent FBI Director Christopher Fray, who was appointed by Trump himself in his first term and is half-way through his ten year term.Critics on the moderate spectrum of politics said Patel's main qualification for the powerful post appeared to be unstinting loyalty to Trump and his pledge to be a hatchet man for the politics of retribution that he has promoted. In one of the oft-quoted interview segments, Patel made no secret of his quest for reprisals against what he calls the ""deep state,"" including against journalists, telling Trump's acolyte Steve Bannon in one podcast, “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly — we’ll figure that out.”So horrified were sections of the media that the Huffington Post reported the story under the headline ""Trump names nut for FBI"" while one critic called him ""a far-right, deranged MAGA loyalist."" Calls went out to moderate Republicans Senators such as Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to block his confirmation.The US Senate will have to confirm Patel's nomination, and as with several other Trump appointments, this one too will be testing the boundaries of acceptance although the MAGA supremo has indicated he will simply get around the confirmation process by making the appointments during recess.Patel was widely tipped for a top job in the incoming Trump II administration, including as head of CIA and Directorate of National Intelligence, but the residue of his slash-and-burn approach during Trump's first term still haunts Washington. At one point during Trump One, the then President considered appointing him as Deputy Director of FBI, but balked Attorney General William Barr threatened to resign, reportedly telling White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that Patel would be deputy director “over my dead body.”","President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday named Kashyap (""Kash) Patel, a middling staffer in his first term, to serve as the next Director of the FBI.

HONOLULU: Taiwan President Lai Ching-te was feted with a red carpet, garlands of flowers and ""alohas"" as he kicked off his two-day stopover in Hawaii on Saturday, part of a Pacific tour that has sparked fiery rhetoric from Beijing.China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has responded to Lai's first overseas trip as president with threats to ""resolutely crush"" any attempt for independence.Looking relaxed in a Hawaiian shirt, Lai flitted around the US island state, visiting a Pacific island history museum, an emergency management centre and the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbour.Earlier, he was given the ""red carpet treatment"" on the tarmac of Honolulu's international airport, according to his office, which said it was the first time a Taiwanese president had been given such a welcome.He was met by Ingrid Larson, managing director in Washington of the American Institute in Taiwan, Hawaii Governor Josh Green, and others.At every turn, Lai was presented with garlands of bright coloured flowers or leaves known as leis, greetings of ""aloha"", and other Hawaiian gifts.In the evening, Lai is expected to attend a dinner with US government officials and Taiwanese people living abroad.Beijing opposes any international recognition of Taiwan and its claim to be a sovereign state and especially bristles at official contact between the island and the United States.Like most countries, Washington does not recognize Taiwan diplomatically but is its most important backer and biggest supplier of arms.After Hawaii, Lai will visit Taiwan's allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau -- the only Pacific island nations among the 12 countries that recognize Taiwan's claim to statehood -- and stop over for one night in the US territory of Guam.Lai said shortly before take-off in Taipei that the trip ""ushered in a new era of values-based democracy"" and thanked the US government for ""helping to make this trip a smooth one"".He said he wanted to ""continue to expand cooperation and deepen partnerships with our allies based on the values of democracy, peace and prosperity.""""I once again emphasize that we are all Team Taiwan. We all work together, and we can successfully achieve our goals,"" Lai told reporters on board the plane.An AFP journalist is travelling with the president for the duration of the trip.- Threat of invasion -Taiwan lives under the constant threat of an invasion by China, which has refused to rule out using force to bring the island under its control.Beijing deploys fighter jets, drones and warships around Taiwan on a near-daily basis to press its claims, with the number of sorties increasing in recent years.Lai's aircraft was accompanied by Taiwanese Air Force F-16 fighter jets for part of its route to Hawaii.""I think this is very meaningful and also makes us feel that we have a long way to go on this trip and bear heavy responsibilities,"" Lai told reporters on board, referring to the escort.Taiwanese government officials have previously stopped over on US soil during visits to the Pacific or Latin America, angering China, which has sometimes responded with military drills around the island.In a swift response to news of Lai's trip on Thursday, Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China's defense ministry said: ""We firmly oppose official interaction with China's Taiwan region in any form"" and vowed to ""resolutely crush"" any attempts for Taiwan independence.Lai's trip follows the US approval on Friday of a proposed sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16s and radar systems, as well as communications equipment, in deals valued at $385 million in total.The Taiwan president's trip comes as Republican US President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January.Taipei has publicly congratulated Trump on his victory, joining other governments around the world in trying to get onside with the mercurial magnate, whose diplomatic style is often transactional.During his campaign, Trump caused jitters by suggesting Taiwan should pay the United States for its defense.","Taiwan President Lai Ching-te kicks off two-day stopover in Hawaii on Saturday.

Violent clashes erupted outside Georgia's parliament between law enforcement and protesters opposing the government's choice to postpone European Union membership discussions during a post-election crisis, on Saturday. For the third consecutive night, thousands gathered in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, resulting in numerous arrests.Following the ruling Georgian Dream party 's declared victory in the October 26 parliamentary election, which pro-European opposition claimed was fraudulent, the Black Sea nation has experienced significant unrest.Police officers in protective gear deployed rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to scatter protesters who were launching fireworks.

Biden's Thanksgiving holiday is part of a longer farewell as Trump's return to White House nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bidens-thanksgiving-holiday-is-part-of-a-longer-farewell-as-trumps-return-to-white-house-nears/articleshow/115857220.cms,"President Joe Biden talks to the media during a visit to Nantucket fire department on Thanksgiving day in Nantucket Mass., Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024. (AP)

NANTUCKET: Joe Biden is wrapping up his final Thanksgiving holiday as president on Nantucket, a family tradition that this year seems to be part of a broader farewell to his time in the White House.The Democrat's four years as president will be bookended by Republican Donald Trump, whose Cabinet nominations, tariff threats and glitzy evenings at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida club, have captured the public's attention since the November election. Biden dropped out of the presidential contest in July and was replaced on the ticket by Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump.During his five days on the Massachusetts island, with its picturesque wood shingle homes and sea-shelled beaches, the 82-year-old Biden was still dealing with questions of his legacy. He returned to Washington late Saturday and will leave for Angola the next day for his only visit to Africa as president.On Friday, as Biden and his family walked along the quaint brick sidewalks and cobblestone streets that have made Nantucket a wealthy and desirable summer vacation spot, passersby shouted ""We love you, Joe."" The Biden contingent included the president's daughter, Ashley, and son, Hunter, as well as Hunter's 4-year-old son, Beau.Over the past year, Biden has called Trump's falsehoods about the government's hurricane relief ""un-American"" and repeatedly warned that the incoming president could undermine U.S. democracy and foreign alliances.But when asked by reporters on Thanksgiving Day what he was thankful for, Biden said: ""I'm thankful for a peaceful transition of the presidency.""Biden also said he was thankful for his family, the new cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the potential for more progress in the Middle East. The president, who has largely avoided reporters' questions lately, engaged on a number of matters related to Trump and policy.He suggested that ""razor-thin"" margins of power for Republicans in the next Congress will mean that Trump will have to accept ""some real compromise"" as he pushes his agenda.""I think there may be a little bit of internal reckoning,"" Biden said.Biden also said he hoped Trump would ""rethink"" his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, leading American trading partners.""We're surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies: Mexico and Canada,"" Biden said. ""And the last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships. I think we've got them in a good place.""Days earlier, Trump had pledged on on his social media site, Truth Social, to impose 25% tariffs on both countries until they stopped illegal immigration and blocked the flow of drugs across their border with the United States. The threat caused Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to engage Trump in a phone call and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly to Florida on Friday to meet with him.After that phone call, Trump claimed in a post to be ""effectively closing our Southern Border,"" a statement that Sheinbaum disputed even as she expressed confidence the tariffs would be averted. Mexico has already taken steps to address the issues raised by Trump - a point also raised by Biden.Trudeau left Florida on Saturday without a commitment by Trump to avoid tariffs. Trump called the meeting ""productive.""Trump has also threatened an additional 10% tariff on China unless it stops exporting materials used to make the drug fentanyl.Biden told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping understood the value of avoiding any missteps in relations with the United States.""The one thing I'm confident about Xi is he doesn't want to make a mistake,"" Biden said. ""And I'm not saying that he is our best buddy, but he -- he understands what's at stake.""On Thanksgiving Day, Biden went to a fire station to deliver pumpkin pies with his wife, Jill, and grandson Beau. The first lady told firefighters and police officers that the family has been going to Nantucket for Thanksgiving since 1975, an outing the family has come to call ""nana-tucket"" in a nod to her central role in establishing the tradition.The firefighters gave the Bidens a pair of baseball caps.The president put his on and asked his grandson, ""What do you think?""""It looks good,"" said the grandson, who demurred when the president asked him if he would like to be a firefighter.On Friday, the Biden family lunched at the Brotherhood of Thieves restaurant and stopped at Nantucket Bookworks, an art gallery and several other shops. Their afternoon ended with the ceremonial Christmas tree lighting and carolers as crowds took pictures and videos of a grinning Biden.This year's holiday might carry particular emotional resonance as a respite from some family tumult.In December, Hunter Biden is scheduled to be sentenced on three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. He also faces sentencing in California in December on federal tax charges he pleaded guilty to in September.The president has previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his eventual sentence.","Biden returned to Washington late Saturday and will leave for Angola the next day for his only visit to Africa as president.

Mom accused US defence secretary pick of mistreating women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mom-accused-us-defence-secretary-pick-of-mistreating-women/articleshow/115855670.cms,"WASHINGTON: The mother of Pete Hegseth , Trump's pick for secretary of defense, wrote him an email in 2018 saying he had routinely mistreated women for years and displayed a lack of character. ""On behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way, I say ... get some help and take an honest look at yourself,"" Penelope Hegseth wrote, stating that she still loved him.""I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.""Penelope Hegseth, in a phone interview with The New York Times on Friday, said that she had sent her son an immediate follow-up email at the time apologising for what she had written. She said she had fired off the original email ""in anger, with emotion"" at a time when he and his wife were going through a very difficult divorce.In the interview, she defended her son and disavowed the sentiments she had expressed in the initial email about his character and treatment of women. ""It is not true. It has never been true,"" she said. She added: ""I know my son. He is a good father, husband."" She said that publishing the contents of the first email was ""disgusting.""Questions about Pete Hegseth's treatment of women have emerged in the weeks since Trump chose him, a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, to lead the Pentagon. The issue could be a subject of scrutiny during Senate confirmation hearings .Reports of his infidelity have focused attention on his character and leadership, particularly for a civilian overseeing the military, where active-duty service members can be subject to prosecution for adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Another issue is how the senators will view a rape complaint against Hegseth filed to police in Oct 2017 after an incident at a political conference in Monterey, California. No charges were ever brought and the complainant has not come forward publicly. Hegseth has said he was falsely accused by a woman with whom he had a consensual sexual encounter. He secretly paid her a settlement a few years later - only because, according to his lawyer, he wanted to protect his job as weekend anchor at Fox & Friends.Penelope Hegseth emailed her son on April 30, 2018, during a turbulent period in his life. He was in the middle of a contentious divorce from his second wife, Samantha, the mother of three of his children. Samantha Hegseth filed for divorce after her husband impregnated a co-worker, part of a pattern of adultery that dated back to his first marriage.Pete Hegseth's mother wrote in the email that she was upset about his treatment of Samantha, writing: ""For you to try to label her as 'unstable' for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you?""""She did not ask for or deserve any of what has come to her by your hand,"" she said.""Neither did Meredith,"" Penelope Hegseth added, referring to his first wife.Hegseth forwarded a copy of her email to Samantha the same night she sent it to her son. The NYT obtained a copy of the email from another person with ties to the Hegseth family.

Kamala Harris faces criticism over post-election fundraising blitz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-faces-criticism-over-post-election-fundraising-blitz/articleshow/115852562.cms,"File photo: US Vice-President Kamala Harris (Picture credit: AP)

Weeks after her election defeat, Vice President Kamala Harris continues to solicit donations through frequent fundraising emails. Critics claim the aggressive approach is alienating supporters while raising questions about her campaign’s financial management.Emails from Harris’ team, dubbed the "" Harris Fight Fund ,"" have urged donors to contribute immediately, warning of the urgent need to counteract President-elect Donald Trump’s nominations and policies.According to the New York Post, one email received chastised recipients, stating, “Our records show that you haven’t pitched in yet. We know the election didn’t turn out as we’d hoped, but we’re not backing down.”Harris' campaign, which raised $1.5 billion over 15 weeks, ended with an alleged $20 million in debt, according to insiders cited by Politico. However, Harris’ team disputes these claims.Critics, including Democratic strategist Jon Reinish, argue that the non-stop appeals are “galling” and potentially damaging to the party. “Getting fundraising requests after a candidate has lost, especially when they’re millions in debt, is insulting,” The New York Post quoted Reinish.The Harris campaign’s spending choices have also come under scrutiny. Notable expenditures included $1 million to Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions, $900,000 for advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere, and millions on private jets and luxury hotels.Over half a billion dollars was channelled to four media consulting firms.James Carville, a longtime Democratic insider, called for an audit of Harris’ campaign finances. “When you have an airplane crash, you don’t just move on. You investigate what went wrong,” The New York Post quotes him. Carville also added that detailed scrutiny is required beyond Federal Election Commission disclosures.Some Democrats fear Harris’ fundraising tactics could alienate small-dollar donors, a key pillar of the party's funding. “This kind of tone erodes trust,” Politico qouted Democratic digital strategist Mike Nellis.James Zogby, a DNC member, has also voiced concerns, describing the fundraising tone as “begging” and calling for greater financial transparency within the Democratic Party.The emails cite ongoing recount efforts and legal challenges as reasons for continued fundraising. However, the fine print reveals that most funds raised flow to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and state-level affiliates rather than the recount account. This practice, while legal, has sparked further debate.The controversy comes ahead of the February 1 election for the next DNC chair, who will oversee the party’s financial direction post-Biden. Candidates like Minnesota DFL Chair Ken Martin and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley are expected to address the issue.Zogby, running for DNC vice chair, advocates for a financial oversight committee to monitor party spending. “Where does the money go, and why don’t we know where it goes?” he told Politico.Despite criticism, Harris remains active in the Democratic fundraising landscape and is reportedly considering another presidential run in 2028. For now, her campaign emails continue to ask donors to “build a foundation of resources” to hold the Trump administration accountable.","US Vice-President Kamala Harris continues to solicit donations through frequent fundraising emails.

President-elect Donald Trump ’s selection of Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Labour Secretary is drawing sharp criticism, not only for her political positions but also for her campaign spending habits.The Oregon congresswoman, who lost her re-election bid this November, reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on luxury hotel stays and limousine services during her campaign, raising eyebrows among her critics.According to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by The New York Post, Chavez-DeRemer’s campaign shelled out over $56,000 on hotel stays between February 2023 and October 2024.The expenses included $6,290 at the five-star Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, which boasts a three-level pool with a view of Camelback Mountain. Other high-profile stays included the Potawatomi Casino Hotel in Milwaukee, a Hilton in Wisconsin, and even a Miami Ritz-Carlton.In addition to hotel expenses, the campaign spent at least $4,345 on limousine and chauffeur services, with one Utah company, Snow Country Limousine, receiving $731.50. Around the same time, her campaign also spent $1,512 at the luxurious St. Regis Deer Valley resort, known for its ski-in, ski-out facilities.These revelations come as Chavez-DeRemer faces backlash from conservative Republicans, who label her a “Republican in name only” due to her support for pro-union policies.As per The New York Post, one GOP insider quipped, “All this wasteful spending, boy is she ready for the Department of Labor ,”.Chavez-DeRemer is one of the few Republicans to back the PRO Act , a union-supported bill aimed at overturning right-to-work laws in over two dozen states. The legislation, which ultimately failed, would have made it easier for workers to unionise. Her nomination is reportedly backed by Teamsters Union President Sean O’Brien, who praised her as a bridge between business and labour communities.While Trump touted her nomination as a move to empower the American workforce, her union-friendly stance has sparked divisions within the Republican Party.Critics point to her support for other controversial policies, including legislation providing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and reforms that benefit public sector workers.","Lori Chavez-DeRemer's campaign shelled out over $56,000 on hotel stays between February 2023 and October 2024.

The 'Mar-a-Lago Face' phenomenon

A heated debate has emerged over the so-called "" Mar-a-Lago face "" trend, a term used to describe the alleged cosmetic enhancements among those in Donald Trump's inner circle.The controversy escalated when Laura Loomer, a Trump supporter and far-right activist, accused DailyMail of using a photoshopped image of her in their reporting on the trend.Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Loomer slammed DailyMail for what she claimed were manipulated images aimed at discrediting her. ""This is honestly so outrageous. @MailOnline now using obviously photoshopped pictures of Trump supporters they don’t like to get clicks,"" she wrote. Loomer alleged her face had been altered in a published image and described it as part of a broader attempt to undermine Trump allies.She added, ""The child has been photoshopped with a mustache and my face has been photoshopped by Daily Mail. Is this what Daily Mail passes as 'journalism' now? Manipulating images of people they don’t like?"" Loomer also shared a recent photo to show what she claimed was her actual appearance and called for the publication to ""delete their post and practice real journalism.""The term ""Mar-a-Lago face"" has been making waves in political circles, describing an aesthetic characterised by Botox, fillers, bronzed skin, and a smooth, artificial complexion.Critics suggest this look has become common among Trump associates, including Lara Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Matt Gaetz, and Kristi Noem.Michigan-based plastic surgeon Dr Anthony Youn previously told DailyMail that some of Trump's allies appeared to have undergone ""mildly to moderately overdone"" cosmetic work.Others, including San Francisco plastic surgeon Dr Corey Maas, criticised the visible effects of Botox in figures such as Gaetz, claiming it left him with ""odd and expressionless"" features. He also added that overuse of Botox in men could lead to a drooping effect, making them appear “evil.”The transformation isn’t limited to men. Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump, has reportedly undergone significant changes, including Botox and cheek fillers, alongside skin treatments to achieve a bronzed glow.According to The Hollywood Reporter, her evolving look aligns with what has been observed in Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr’s fiancée, who experts believe has overused Botox and fillers, resulting in facial asymmetry.Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who was nominated for Homeland Security Secretary, also caught public attention.Reports from The New York Times highlighted that Noem’s straightened teeth and polished appearance seemed part of a calculated effort to fit the aesthetic preferences of Trump’s orbit. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean commented that Noem appeared to be catering to “an audience of one,” referring to the former president.Interestingly, Trump himself reportedly disapproves of plastic surgery.As per The Atlantic, the President-elect was “disgusted” upon learning about the extent of Laura Loomer’s alleged cosmetic enhancements.However, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the broader trend of cosmetic tweaking has permeated DC across party lines, with politicians like Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden also rumoured to rely on aesthetic treatments.",Far-right activist Laura Loomer accused DailyMail of using photoshopped image of her in their reporting on the 'Mar-a-Lago face' trend.

BALOCHISTAN: At least 10 Baloch men have been reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistforces in separate incidents in Jiwani, Uthal, Turbat, and Karachi areas of Pakistan .

They have been identified as Waris, son of Saleem, and Nisar, son of Aslam. They were taken to an unknown location.In Karachi, a rickshaw driver named Sadiq Ahmed, son of Dilmurad, and a resident of Kan Gichk, was reportedly arrested in the Lea Market area. His whereabouts are also unknown.During this series of disappearances, one individual, Sheyak, son of Allah Bakhsh, who was abducted in Gwadar on November 22, has since returned home.Human rights activists and advocacy organizations have expressed grave concern over the escalating cases of enforced disappearances in Balochistan.

The Baloch nation is enduring the worst forms of oppression. With each passing day, disturbing reports of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances emerge. Hundreds of innocent individuals and their families are subjected to this cruel practice, and in many cases, these victims are executed.""The statement further condemned the silence of human rights organizations and the media, highlighting that the genocide of the Baloch people is intensifying while the world remains indifferent. The lives of the Baloch people hold no significance to anyone. State violence has reached its peak.In the statement posted on X, BYC stated, ""Today alone, eight Baloch individuals were forcibly disappeared from a single household, leaving behind no male member, including an elderly person, Dr. Zafar, and his son, Raheem Baloch. Additionally, five of Dr. Zafar's guests were abducted from his house. While Dr. Zafar was later released after severe humiliation and torture, the others remain forcibly disappeared.""The BYC expressed its grave concern, emphasizing that despite their peaceful efforts, the genocide they are resisting is rapidly intensifying.Vowing to continue its resistance movement, the BYC stated, ""We can never, and will never, remain indifferent while our people endure such brutality. BYC will continue to strengthen and expand the resistance movement against the ongoing Baloch genocide.""",At least 10 Baloch men have been reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistforces in separate incidents.

Why Pakistan authorities are trying to arrest Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/why-pakistan-authorities-are-trying-to-arrest-imran-khans-wife-bushra-bibi/articleshow/115811064.cms,"Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan (Picture credit: ANI)

Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan , for failing to appear in court in an alleged corruption case involving 190 million pounds.Authorities attempted to arrest Bibi at her residence in Peshawar on November 23, but the attempt was unsuccessful as she was not present when the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) team and police arrived, according to a PTI report.An accountability court issued non-bailable warrants for Bibi on November 22 after she missed eight court hearings. The warrants led the NAB to dispatch a team to arrest her. Bibi currently resides in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Khan's political party, PTI, holds power.Both Khan and Bibi face accusations of misusing 50 billion Pakistani Rupees (190 million pounds). These funds, originally returned to Pakistan by the UK's national crime agency in a settlement with a property tycoon, were allegedly meant for the national treasury. Instead, authorities claim they were used for the personal benefit of the businessman who helped Bibi and Khan establish a university.Bibi, a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust , is accused of benefiting from the settlement and acquiring 458 kanals of land for Al-Qadir University in Jhelum. Last month, she was granted bail after nine months in custody related to a separate case known as the Toshakhana case .","Pakistani authorities are seeking to arrest Bushra Bibi, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Moments later, the man was pushed from the container and was seen clinging to the container's edge before plummeting approximately 25 feet to the ground.According to a report by BBC, the incident reportedly occurred at the intersection of Jinnah and Ataturk Avenues, the epicenter of the protests. The condition of the man remains unknown.The protests were sparked by the arrest of Imran Khan , who has been in prison since August 2023 on corruption charges. Thousands of his supporters, many traveling from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, marched to Islamabad to demand his release. Among them was Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, who led the demonstration alongside Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.However, the demonstrations quickly descended into chaos. The government reported that four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed in clashes late Monday, with over 100 security personnel injured. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused protesters of resorting to violence, alleging that they rammed vehicles into paramilitary troops.The crackdown was swift and severe, with nearly 1,000 protesters arrested. Security forces employed tear gas, baton charges, and roadblocks to disperse crowds, effectively quelling the unrest. The intensity of the response led to the protest’s premature collapse, dealing a significant blow to Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.","A protester was allegedly pushed off a stack of shipping containers by security forces during a demonstration calling for the release of former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

ISLAMABAD: A well-known Pakistani journalist, Matiullah Jan, investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has been booked in terrorism and narcotics cases in Islamabad on Thursday.Jan was picked up by unknown individuals along with another journalist, Saqib Bashir, late Wednesday night. His family said he was abducted from the parking of a hospital in Islamabad at around 11pm by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Bashir, who was later released, said they were collecting data from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on the casualties after the march when they were taken.The incident took place amid rising tensions in the capital following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s claims that more than 200 of its workers had been killed by security forces during a late Tuesday night operation to disperse Imran’s supporters in the capital. The protesters had gathered to demand the release from jail of Imran Khan and other politicians and workers of his party.On Thursday afternoon, Islamabad police booked Jan with charges related to terrorism, drug-peddling and attacking police. “It is no less than a joke. There is not an iota of truth in these charges,” his lawyer, Imaan Mazari, said.The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed grave alarm over Jan’s “abduction” and demanded on social media that the “authorities must ensure Jan’s safety and immediate release”.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also demanded Jan’s immediate release and condemned his arrest as part of an authoritarian tactic to silence journalists. “This authoritarian tactic to silence journalists must cease,” the HRCP asserted.","Journalist Matiullah Jan was investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.
