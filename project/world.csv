'Misleading': Congress slams Kerala CM Vijayan on 'Sanatana dharma' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/misleading-congress-slams-kerala-cm-vijayan-on-sanatana-dharma-remark/articleshow/116878290.cms,"V D Satheesan and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan (right)

Who was Sree Narayana Guru?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader V D Satheesan on Wednesday criticized Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan 's statement on Sanatana Dharma , saying it attempted to associate the concept exclusively with the Sangh Parivar.Satheesan said Sanatana Dharma is a part of cultural heritage , including Advaita philosophy, the teachings of the Vedas, and the Upanishads. ""Claiming that all of this belongs to the Sangh Parivar is misleading,"" Satheesan told reporters after an event at the Sivagiri pilgrimage.Attending a Sivagiri pilgrimage conference, Vijayan had warned against efforts to portray Sree Narayana Guru , who advocated ""one caste, one religion, and one God,"" as a supporter of Sanatana Dharma. Vijayan described Sanatana Dharma as varnashrama dharma, a caste-based system that Guru opposed.Satheesan compared Vijayan’s remarks to suggesting that all who visit temples, wear saffron, or use sandalwood paste belong to the RSS. ""Handing over Sanatana Dharma and its legacy to the Sangh Parivar is incorrect. What the chief minister said is wrong,"" Satheesan said. He added that Hinduism, like other religions, has faced misuse by priesthoods and monarchies but said dismissing Sanatana Dharma or associating it solely with the Sangh Parivar is inaccurate.""We do not support the varna-ashrama or chaturvarnya system. Even Sree Narayana Guru has explained the essence of Sanatana Dharma in detail. It is not right to dismiss Sanatana Dharma entirely or claim that it exclusively belongs to the Sangh Parivar,"" Satheesan said.Satheesan argued that Sanatana Dharma is not communal and that it has been misinterpreted and misrepresented by the Chief Minister. ""His portrayal is inaccurate. In the past, people used to talk about 'saffronisation,' which was also misunderstood and misused. Driving all Hindus into the RSS fold through such narratives is not the right approach. This is not what should be done,"" he said.Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief K Sudhakaran also responded, alleging an attempt to ""hijack"" Sree Narayana Guru's ideals and legacy. ""There is an effort to confine Sree Narayana Guru, who proclaimed 'One Caste, One Religion, One God,' within the frameworks of chaturvarnya and varna-ashrama under the guise of Sanatana Dharma,"" he said, adding that the Guru’s teachings cannot be surrendered to such narratives.""Guru was never a propagator or practitioner of Sanatan Dharma. Instead, he was someone who tried to reconstruct Sanatan Dharma for the new age,"" Vijayan had said, adding, ""Guru was someone who stood against casteism. His new age dharma was not something defined by religion but rooted in the betterment of people, irrespective of their religion. Tying (him) within the framework of Sanatan Dharma would be a sin against Guru.""Widely respected in Kerala for combining spiritual teachings with social reform, Sree Narayana Guru's philosophy, originating in the early 20th century, is rooted in Advaita Vedanta. This doctrine emphasizes ""non-duality,"" asserting that the ""ultimate reality"" or ""Brahman"" is singular and indivisible, and that the ""individual self"" or ""Atman"" is unified with this universal essence.Guru's transformative message, ""One Caste, One Religion, One God for Man,"" challenged societal norms and promoted the opening of consecrated temples to people of all castes.","Congress leader V D Satheesan criticized Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's statement on Sanatana Dharma. Vijayan had warned against efforts to portray Sree Narayana Guru, who advocated ""one caste, one religion, and one God,"" as a supporter of Sanatan Dharma.Satheesan compared Vijayan’s remarks to suggesting that all who visit temples and wear saffron belong to the RSS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116880228,imgsize-1217438,width-400,resizemode-4/116880228.jpg"

It upheld quashing of arrest of former Haryana Congress MLA Surender Panwar by ED in a money laundering case related to illegal mining.ED had arrested Panwar in July at 1.40am after interrogating him for around 15 hours but his arrest was quashed by Punjab and Haryana high court in Sept and the agency moved the apex court against the high court order.Appearing for ED, advocate Zoheb Hossain said high court had wrongly recorded in its order that Panwar was quizzed for 14 hours and 40 minutes non-stop and added that he was given dinner break during interrogation. Hossain said the agency had already taken steps to streamline the process and to ensure that people were not interrogated during the wee hours.Rejecting ED's contention, the bench asked how the agency could torture a person by interrogating him for such a long period without a break. However, the court made it clear that observations made by high court and itself were only on the issue of grant of bail and not on the merits of the case.In its order, high court had noted that as per ED's case, the petitioner was issued notice/summons and ""he duly appeared in the zonal office of ED at Gurgaon at 11am and he was constantly interrogated up till 1.40am (July 20) for 14 hours and 40 minutes, which is not heroic on the part of ED; rather it is against the dignity of a human being"".""For future, in view of the mandate under Article 21, this court is observing that ED shall take remedial measures and sensitise officers to follow some reasonable time limit for investigation in one go against suspect(s) in such cases. To be precise, it would be appreciated if some necessary mechanism is put in place for fair investigation of the accused as per basic human rights laid down by United Nations, instead of meting out unnecessary harassment for such a longer duration at one stretch for a given day,"" high court had said.Echoing HC's sentiments, the SC bench said it was ""inhuman conduct"" on part of ED officers. The court said it was not a case related to terrorist activity but an illegal sand mining case and ""this is not the way to treat people in such a case"". ""You are forcing a person to make a statement,"" it added.The bench upheld the high court order which said Panwar's initial arrest as well as grounds of arrest were unsustainable in law and there was no material with the ED to substantiate that the politician directly or indirectly indulged in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime.In a remedial measure, ED recently issued a circular directing its officers not to quiz people at late hours or keep them waiting long at its office.",ED had arrested Surender Panwar in July at 1.40am after interrogating him for around 15 hours.

New footage has surfaced showing the moments leading up to a terror attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans that claimed 15 lives and left multiple others injured on New Year. The attacker, identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar , allegedly navigated around a police cruiser barricade before driving a truck into a crowd of revelers.The footage, shared on X, shows that several vehicles had crossed the barricade amidst congested streets, a result of the festivities.Witnesses allege that the barricades in place were inadequate. “We have these hydraulic steel barriers from past events. Those barricades were not up, period. They had the flimsy orange ones that you could just push over with your finger,” a witness told CNN.Local reports also indicate that the city was in the process of replacing the bollards on Bourbon Street.Jabbar’s attack unfolded in the heart of the French Quarter, where he drove a truck into a densely packed crowd before being fatally shot during a gunfight with police. The aftermath revealed a scene of carnage, as Bourbon Street had been bustling with celebrants ushering in the year 2025.According to police commissioner Anne Kirkpatrick, the suspect was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did” and made deliberate attempts “to run over as many people as he could.”The FBI’s special agent in charge, Alethea Duncan, disclosed that evidence recovered from Jabbar’s vehicle—including weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and an ISIS flag—has led investigators to suspect a network of accomplices. “This was not an isolated act,” Duncan said.Condemnations poured in from across the political spectrum. US President Joe Biden said, “There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities.”Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump linked the incident to illegal immigration, claiming, “They’re worse than the criminals we have in our country"" before it was revealed that he was a US citizen.","Shamsud Din Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd of revelers in New Orleans on New Year's Eve, killing 15 and injuring multiple others.

The witnesses said that they saw the truck engulfed in flames in front of the hotel.The fire firefighters found at least two pieces of identification that confirmed Livelsberger's identity.Livelsberger rented the vehicle on the peer-to-peer rental app Turo, according to the company, and the Tesla truck was rented the same way.

The incident

Shamsud-Din Jabbar , the suspect driver behind the terrorist attack in New Orleans that killed at least 15, acted alone but was inspired by Isis, the FBI revealed.Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, said during a briefing that the New Orleans truck attack was ""an act of terrorism,"" and the attacker was ""100% inspired by Isis,"" although he acted alone. He added that the FBI is confident at this point that Jabbar ""had no accomplices.""Jabbar, who drove a truck into a crowd on New Year’s Eve in New Orleans, killing at least 15 people, had declared his support for Isis online, the FBI announced Thursday. He posted several videos on Facebook, detailing his violent plan and radical thinking as he drove from his home in Texas to Louisiana, according to FBI Raia.Jabbar initially intended to harm his family and friends but altered his plan after becoming worried that the media would not highlight the ""war between the believers and the disbelievers,"" according to Raia.Jabbar posted five videos between 1:30 am and just after 3 am on New Year’s Eve, hours before the attack. In the videos, he claimed to have joined ISIS before the summer. He also left a will and testament, according to the FBI.The attack occurred on Bourbon Street, a popular tourist destination in New Orleans’ French Quarter. While Jabbar initially intended to target his family and friends, he ultimately chose Bourbon Street, and the FBI is still investigating the specific reason behind his choice of location. Police shot and killed Jabbar at the scene.Raia said, as quoted by NBC, “This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” adding that Jabbar acted alone. “He was 100% inspired by Isis.”Raia said security video shows Jabbar placing a cooler with an improvised explosive device on Bourbon Street and another one about two blocks away. The devices did not detonate and were later made safe.According to two senior US law enforcement officials, the bombs, taped inside the coolers, were made from galvanized pipe with end caps and contained nails.The devices also had receivers for remote firing, the officials added. It remains unclear whether Jabbar attempted to detonate them, whether they malfunctioned, or what his exact plan was.“We’re confident at this point that he had no accomplices,” Raia added.Raia said the FBI recovered three cellphones and two laptops linked to Jabbar , and investigators were working to determine the content of the devices.Raia mentioned that the FBI has received over 400 tips from the public, including from New Orleans and other areas, and he encouraged anyone who had interacted with Jabbar to come forward.“We are examining every aspect of his life,” he said. “Whether you knew Jabbar personally, worked with him, served in the military, or saw him in New Orleans or Texas, we need to speak with you.”According to US defense officials, Jabbar served on active duty in the Army from 2006 to 2015 and then in the Army Reserve from 2015 to 2020. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant in 2020.Jabbar had been working for the professional services giant Deloitte in a staff-level role since 2021. He attended Georgia State University from 2015 to 2017 and earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration with a focus on computer information systems, according to a university spokesperson.Civil records indicate that Jabbar was married twice, with his first marriage ending in 2012 and his second in 2022.A woman who identified herself as Jabbar’s sister-in-law and requested to remain anonymous said his relatives in Texas were shocked upon hearing the news. “It makes ‘no sense,’” she told NBC News on Wednesday. “He’s the nicest person I’ve ever known.”“I really don’t know what happened,” she continued. “He was a good man. He takes care of his children and everything.”Jabbar drove a Ford F-150 Lightning truck, with a black Isis flag attached to its hitch, onto Bourbon Street early Wednesday. He navigated around a ""hard target"" area that included officers, barriers, and a car, before plowing into a crowd of revelers. The attack killed at least 15 people and injured at least 35, according to an NBC report. Jabbar was killed in a gunfight with police officers, two of whom were injured but stable.Investigators believe Jabbar rented the white Ford truck in Houston on Monday and drove it to New Orleans the following evening.","Shamsud-Din Jabbar acted alone but was inspired by Isis, the FBI said.

Germany: Nearly 190 members of far-right groups wanted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-nearly-190-members-of-far-right-groups-wanted/articleshow/116899768.cms,"Why are those suspects wanted?

What are Reichsbürger and Selbstverwalter?

Germany's interior ministry had outstanding arrest warrants against 189 suspects deemed members of far-right groups that do not recognize the modern German state, media group RND reported on Thursday.Authorities said the suspects were part of ""Reichsbürger"" (""citizens of the Reich"") or "" Selbstverwalter "" (""self-administrators"") groups, which claim either to live in the defunct German Empire, or on soil they have unilaterally declared to be independent within Germany.The figure was published on September 30, 2024 in response to a parliamentary request for information from the socialist Left Party.In total, 254 arrest warrants were open against such suspects, the ministry said, with some facing more than one warrant.There were 43 individuals wanted for at least one violent crime, and three accused of several violent crimes.The ministry said 20 of the warrants were for violent political crime, and another 77 for politically motivated non-violent crimes like forgery, coercion or inciting racial violence.It classified the remaining warrants as being for ""the area of general criminality without political motivation.""German authorities believe that more than 20 of the people sought are residing abroad; some of them have been at large for years.Between the end of March and September last year, 93 fresh warrants of this kind were issued against either ""Reichsbürger"" or ""Selbstverwalter,"" the data showed.""Reichsbürger"" typically deny the legitimacy and existence of the modern German state and the 1918 dissolution of the defunct German Empire.Their ideas of what, and where, the German state is are ""directly in opposition to the territorial integrity of our neighboring states and with that against efforts at understanding between nations,"" according to the Interior Ministry.Antisemitism has also often been part of some of the group's members' ideology, the ministry said, in some cases including stances like Holocaust denial.Members of the other group, ""Selbstverwalter,"" claim to see their legal position in Germany similarly, but instead base their argument on their having unilaterally declared their property sovereign and independent.""With their behavior, Selbstverwalter want above all to resist paying taxes and other demands like foreclosures,"" the ministry said.Multiple trials connected to an alleged group of Reichsbürger accused of plotting to violently overthrow the government are ongoing around the country.The most prominent defendant is Heinrich XIII Prince Reus, a descendant of German nobility born a private citizen in 1951. The group are accused of plotting to install him as head of a future state.","Authorities say 189 suspects are members of far-right groups that do not recognize the modern German state.

Double takeoff terror: Watch Nok Air flight fails takeoff twice in dramatic incident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/double-takeoff-terror-watch-nok-air-flight-fails-takeoff-twice-in-dramatic-incident/articleshow/116898821.cms,"Representative photo

Passengers aboard Nok Air flight DD176 experienced sheer terror on December 30, when their plane attempted—and failed—takeoff not once, but twice at Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport, reported the Post. The ordeal unfolded just a day after the devastating Jeju Air crash involving the same model, a Boeing 737-800 , that claimed 179 lives in South Korea, adding a chilling layer to the unfolding drama.Narongsak Toyabut, a passenger who filmed the harrowing moments, described the chaos. “The first attempt raised concerns when the engines stalled,” he said. But the second attempt brought full-blown panic. “The engine sounded wrong. The plane sped past the usual takeoff point but didn’t lift. By the second hangar, it suddenly slowed. That’s when we knew something was terribly wrong.”With passengers gripping their seats in fear, the captain announced an engine malfunction and taxied back to the terminal. Toyabut, still visibly shaken, said, “It’s hard to explain the terror. I’m thankful the captain didn’t push the flight. I can’t imagine what would’ve happened mid-air.”Nok Air scrambled to control the fallout, issuing a statement: “Passenger safety is our priority. The aircraft underwent inspection, and a replacement plane was provided, delaying the flight to 7:20 pm. We apologize for the inconvenience.”The timing of this incident couldn’t be more haunting. Just a day earlier, Jeju Air flight 7C2216 from Bangkok to Muan, South Korea, erupted into flames after hitting an embankment during an emergency landing. Investigators are piecing together why the landing gear failed to deploy and what led the pilot to attempt a second landing after reporting a bird strike.For passengers aboard DD176, the close call felt like a brush with fate. The unsettling coincidence of back-to-back incidents involving the Boeing 737-800 leaves travelers questioning the skies and the safeguards meant to protect them.","Passengers aboard Nok Air flight DD176 experienced sheer terror on December 30.

(Photos: New York Post)

A Quran open to violence

A chaotic scene at home

A house of red flags

A veteran’s downfall

Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a 42-year-old New Orleans terrorist who pledged allegiance to Isis, left behind a chilling scene in his North Houston trailer home—complete with bomb-making materials , a Quran open to a passage glorifying violence, and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.On New Year’s Day, Jabbar drove a rented Ford F-150 Lightning into the heart of Bourbon Street , mowing down revelers at 3 am in a gruesome rampage. Fourteen people were killed, dozens injured, and Jabbar himself died in a shootout with police. Federal investigators have ruled it an act of terrorism The video posted by the New York Post showed a workbench in Jabbar’s bedroom set up for assembling explosives. Nearby, his Quran stood prominently atop a bookshelf, opened to Verse 9:111, which reads: “They fight in Allah’s cause, and slay and are slain; a promise binding…” The verse, widely interpreted as a call to violence by extremist ideologies, cast a haunting shadow over his already sinister acts.This passage, investigators believe, fueled Jabbar’s radicalization . It was the same ideology he embraced in chilling videos posted online minutes before his attack, where he declared his allegiance to Isis and issued threats, including to his own family.The aftermath of the FBI raid on Jabbar’s trailer painted a picture of a man living on the edge. The home was in disarray, with the front door kicked down, cabinets flung open, and furniture overturned.His main bedroom held a keffiyeh in the closet and bomb-making tools on the workbench—ominous signs of his dark turn. Despite the mess, the home seemed eerily as if he had just left, with clothes and belongings scattered about.Jabbar’s trailer home painted a grim portrait of his descent into extremism . Chemical residues and bottles filled the property, with an inventory left behind by FBI agents listing compounds commonly used in bomb-making. A rolled-up prayer rug and numerous Islamic books further hinted at his radicalization.Yet, the home also bore traces of his fragmented personal life. A back bedroom was cluttered with children’s toys and bunk beds—remnants of his role as a father to two daughters, aged 15 and 20.Hours before his attack, Jabbar told neighbors he was leaving for New Orleans for a new IT job. The lie was soon laid bare as the same white truck he drove off in became his weapon of mass destruction.Once an Army staff sergeant, Jabbar served ten years, including deployments to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2019. But after leaving active duty in 2015 and the reserves in 2020, his life unraveled. Financial woes from two divorces, a failed real estate career, and struggles as an IT specialist marked his civilian years.Despite his quiet demeanor, Jabbar’s radicalization had alarming roots. In videos posted before his attack, he not only declared loyalty to Isis but also threatened to murder his own family. His younger brother, Abdur Jabbar, expressed shock: “This is more some type of radicalization, not religion. He was a sweetheart really, a nice guy, a friend, really smart, caring.”","Shamsud-Din Jabbar left behind bomb-making materials, an open Quran and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.

This is not the only connection to the two major attacks that took place on New Year's Day. Both attackers rented their trucks from Turo app for the purpose of carrying out the attacks.

Who was Matthew Livelsberger?



Who was Shamsud Din Jabbar?



Major attacks on New Year: What is still not known?



37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger who blew up a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas had a connection with Shamsud Din Jabbar , the New Orleans attacker , reports claimed citing law enforcement sources who confirmed that both of them served at the same military base Fort Bragg. Jabbar enlisted in the Army in 2007 and Livelsberger was in the Army since 2006. It is not yet known whether the two attacks were also connected.As New Orleans was reeling under the terror attack on New Year's Day, a Tesla cyber truck exploded in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as a former Army veteran of Colorado Springs, Matthew Livelsberger, died in the explosion. Officers have not publicly named Livelsberger as the bomber, but sources confirmed the name to KOAA and KTNV. Livelsberger was an active-duty Army soldier, officials confirmed. Livelsberger spent 18 of his 19-year Army career with the Special Forces, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is believed to have joined the Green Berets as a communication specialist in January 2006, before becoming an operations manager and team sergeant in February 2023. His most recent role, from November 2024, was listed as a Remote and Autonomous Systems Manager for the Army.The truck had a tumble of charred fireworks, mortars, canisters and other explosive devices at the back. It is not yet known how the explosives were detonated.Shamsud Din Jabbar was the New Orleans attacker who plowed his truck through a New Year crowd on famous Bourbon Street killing at least 15 people. After the massacre, he fired at the police officials and died in the brief shootout. He also rented his car from Turo. A Turo spokesperson told Newsweek the company does not believe that ""either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.""Jabbar served almost eight years in the US Army and was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to February 2010. He transferred to the Army Reserve after leaving active duty in January 2015 and then left the reserves as a staff sergeant in July 2020.Apart from their Turo connection, both of them previously served at the same military base, and were in Afghanistan around the same time, reports confirmed.Both the attacks looked intentional, though in the cybertruck explosion, Livelsberger is the only casualty. Law enforcement officials credited Elon Mysk's Tesla as the truck contained a maximum of the damage.Authorities are investigating a possible link between the two men. At the time they were fighting in the Middle East, the US had around 100,000 military personnel in Afghanistan as part of President Barack Obama’s ‘troop surge.’It is not known whether the two incidents had any connection, or whether Livelsberger and Jabbar acted together.FBI said New Orleans attacker Jabbar definitely did not act alone.

Sheikh Mujibur Bahman - 1971

Who was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman



The landmark March 7, 1971 speech by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in our #GreatSpeeches series

The educational curriculum in Bangladesh is undergoing significant changes. The revised textbooks will attribute the declaration of independence in 1971 to Ziaur Rahman instead of ' Bangabandhu ' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman . They have also eliminated Mujib's title as 'Father of the Nation'.""The new textbooks for the 2025 academic year will state that 'on March 26, 1971, Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh, and on March 27, he made another declaration of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu',"" Prof AKM Reazul Hassan, chairman of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board, told The Daily Star.The information has been included in the free textbooks where the matter of the declaration was mentioned, he added.Ziaur Rahman established the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and was married to current BNP leader Khaleda Zia. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was the father of recently removed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, spearheaded the country's liberation movement.According to the report, writer and researcher Rakhal Raha, who was involved in the process of making changes in the textbooks, said they tried to free the textbooks from ""exaggerated, imposed history"".""Those who revised the textbooks found that it wasn't fact-based information that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman sent the wireless message [declaring independence] while being arrested by the Pakistani army, and so they decided to remove it.""Previously, the content in textbooks for grades one through 10 regarding the person who made the Declaration of Independence was altered based on whichever political party held power.Awami League supporters strongly maintain that Mujibur Rahman issued the declaration, while Ziaur Rahman, then serving as an Army major and subsequent sector commander during the Liberation War, simply delivered the announcement following Mujib's directives.Previously, Bangladesh initiated steps to remove Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's image from its currency notes during the phase-out of older notes.This action followed the removal of his daughter Sheikh Hasina from her position as prime minister on August 5. As she sought refuge in India, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's statues and murals were vandalised.Earlier, Bangladesh’s interim government, led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, decided to cancel eight National Days, including the March 7 and August 15 celebrations which are associated with the country’s Liberation War spearheaded by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.According to Awami League, the decision to cancel the March 7 national holiday, a date that marks Sheikh Mujib’s iconic speech that galvanised the people to fight for independence, was motivated by an ideological rejection of Mujib’s role in the nation’s founding. Similarly, the cancellation of August 15 as National Mourning Day is seen as an attempt to downplay the assassination of Bangabandhu and his family.Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, referred as 'Bangabandhu', served as the inaugural president of independent Bangladesh. His life ended tragically when Bangladesh Army officers executed a coup, raiding his Dhanmondi 32 residence. This incident represented a crucial moment in Bangladesh's political landscape, marking the military's first direct interference in civilian governance. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman served in leadership roles as either president or prime minister from April 1971 until his assassination.His Awami League party achieved overwhelming success in the 1970 general election of united Pakistan, securing virtually all seats in East Pakistan, which subsequently became Bangladesh. Initially serving as Bangladesh's prime minister, he later established one-party rule and assumed the presidency in January 1975. On August 15, within his first year as president, soldiers assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman alongside his wife and three sons.In the ensuing period, commerce minister Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad took control, declaring himself interim government head from August 15, 1975, to November 6, 1975. Ahmad's leadership proved short-lived. On November 3, army chief of staff Khaled Mosharraf led a successful coup against him. Subsequently, rival insurgents killed Mosharraf. After several successive coups and counter-coups, General Ziaur Rahman ultimately gained control on November 7."," textbooks will attribute the declaration of independence in 1971 to Ziaur Rahman instead of'Bangabandhu'Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Police behind the investigation of the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas expressed gratitude towards CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday citing the strong construction of the vehicle body that limited the explosion. Police noted that the attack could have been worse but the vehicle limited the blast and its damage.Speaking to CNN, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said that the structural design of the Cybertruck helped contain the damage in the hotel valet area, directing the explosion's force upwards and preserving the building's front glass windows.""The fact that this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet because it had most of the blast. Up through the truck and out,"" he said.""You'll see that the front glass doors at the Trump Hotel were not even broken by that blast which they were parked directly in front of,"" he added.He further elaborated on how the Tesla Motors’ CEO helped the police to track the driver.""I have to thank Elon Musk specifically,"" McMahill expressed gratitude towards Tesla's CEO, saying that Elon Musk provided ""additional information"", including surveillance footage from charging stations to assist in tracking the suspect.""We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,"" Musk said in a post on X.Musk further clarified that ""All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,"" referring to Tesla's data collection system that monitors vehicle performance metrics, including mileage and travel distance.""It’s a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it’s the Trump tower,"" McMahill said. ""So, there’s obviously things to be concerned about there, and that’s something we continue to look at.”The Cybertruck, rented in Colorado, made its way to Las Vegas, arriving at 7.30 am on Wednesday, according to McMahill. Following an hour of driving along Las Vegas Boulevard, the vehicle reached the Trump Hotel where it detonated, according to officials.The official said that surveillance recordings showed the driver passing the Trump Hotel approximately an hour before the explosion, later returning to stop in front of the building moments before the blast.Police-released CCTV footage captured the explosion incident. Additional social media videos showed the vehicle covered in smoke whilst being extinguished with water. Police officials presented footage during a press conference showing charred petrol containers and firework mortars discovered in the remains of the severely burnt vehicle.Several law enforcement officials involved in the investigation indicated that the driver likely had military experience.Although authorities have identified who rented the vehicle, they are withholding the driver's name pending identification.The incident occurred shortly after a tragic event in New Orleans, where a pickup truck ploughed into New Year's revellers on Bourbon Street early Wednesday, causing at least 15 fatalities and numerous injuries. According to local and federal authorities, the driver possessed potential improvised explosive devices and an ISIS flag in the vehicle.Turo, an online vehicle-sharing platform, confirmed its service was used to rent vehicles involved in both the New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents, and stated it is assisting authorities.""We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,"" a Turo spokesperson told CNN.McMahill said the shared rental platform for both incidents was merely a ""coincidence,"" and investigations are ongoing. ""We are absolutely investigating any connectivity to what happened in New Orleans as well as other attacks that have been occurring around the world,"" McMahill said.",Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

Candidates with significant physical fitness deficits and questionable academic qualifications are being admitted.

The drug policy for applicants has been “liberalized,” allowing individuals with histories of substance abuse to join the bureau.

Supervisors are pressured to advance candidates who fail basic requirements, including fitness tests and English proficiency, to meet DEI goals.

Conservative Backlash



Broader Implications



A Divided Narrative



The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is under intense scrutiny following the New Orleans New Year’s Day attack, an incident that led to confusion over whether it constituted an act of terrorism. While investigations continue, the controversy has reignited broader debates over the agency’s recruitment standards and the influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) initiatives.The New Orleans attack, where a pickup truck plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing and injuring multiple people, was initially categorized by the FBI as non-terroristic. However, the discovery of potential ties to extremist ideologies, including an Islamic State flag attached to the vehicle, prompted the FBI to reclassify the incident as a terrorism investigation.The suspect, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was killed in a confrontation with law enforcement after the attack. Authorities revealed that the truck used in the attack was adorned with a black flag resembling those associated with the Islamic State and contained several improvised explosive devices (IEDs), though their viability is still under investigation. Jabbar’s background has raised additional concerns; he was reportedly on a federal watchlist due to past associations with extremist groups. Investigators are now probing his potential connections to larger networks and whether he acted alone or as part of a coordinated effort.Witnesses described the horrifying scene as the truck veered into the crowd, causing chaos during New Year’s celebrations. Surveillance footage has provided crucial evidence, showing Jabbar’s movements in the hours leading up to the attack. While the motive is still being determined, preliminary findings suggest ideological influences may have played a role.Special Agent Alethea Duncan , one of the FBI’s public faces during the probe, initially stated that the attack did not meet the criteria for terrorism. This apparent flip-flop drew sharp criticism from conservative commentators and social media users, who accused the FBI of attempting to minimize the attack’s severity. The criticism intensified when reports emerged that the agency’s recruitment practices—influenced by DEI policies—may be compromising its effectiveness.The controversy surrounding Special Agent Alethea Duncan has also drawn attention to her nose ring, which some critics have used as a symbol of perceived lax standards within the agency.According to the FBI’s official dress and appearance guidelines, agents are expected to maintain a professional appearance that aligns with the bureau’s mission. While there is no outright ban on nose rings, such accessories are typically discouraged in field operations or high-visibility roles to ensure uniformity and professionalism. Exceptions may be granted based on cultural or religious grounds, reflecting broader DEI policies aimed at inclusivity.Under the leadership of FBI Director Christopher Wray , DEI initiatives have been central to the agency’s efforts to diversify its workforce. According to a report submitted to the House Judiciary Committee, these initiatives prioritize race, gender, and sexual orientation over traditional qualifications such as physical fitness, integrity, and experience. Critics argue that this shift undermines the FBI’s mission to protect national security.The report, compiled by an alliance of active-duty and retired FBI agents, paints a grim picture of recruitment practices. It alleges that:Right-wing commentators and politicians have seized on these allegations to critique the FBI’s priorities. Figures like Miranda Devine of the New York Post argue that DEI mandates are diluting the FBI’s quality and effectiveness, prioritizing political correctness over competence.Social media has amplified these concerns, with users highlighting cases from the report that describe candidates being pushed through despite serious disqualifications. For example, one account mentions an applicant rejected by local police but later hired by the FBI under non-special-agent roles. Another recounts an overweight recruit being advanced despite failing physical fitness standards.The controversy over DEI in the FBI is emblematic of larger cultural battles within the United States. Proponents of DEI argue that a diverse workforce strengthens the FBI by bringing varied perspectives and fostering trust with historically underrepresented communities. Critics counter that these policies prioritize ideology over competence, risking national security.The alliance of whistleblowers warns that the current trajectory could lead to “generational failure” within the bureau. They have called for an audit of FBI recruitment practices and demanded congressional oversight to ensure that recruitment standards are aligned with national security priorities.The uproar over Alethea Duncan’s handling of the New Orleans attack highlights the challenges facing the FBI in balancing operational transparency with public relations. Right-wing critics frame Duncan’s role—and her visible nose ring—as symbolic of the “woke” culture they believe has infiltrated the agency. Others see this focus as a distraction from the substantive issues surrounding the attack and the FBI’s response. As the FBI continues its investigation into the New Orleans attack, the agency faces mounting pressure to address criticisms of its recruitment and training practices. For its detractors, the debate over DEI is not merely about hiring policies but about the FBI’s ability to fulfill its core mission: safeguarding the nation. Whether the FBI can navigate this contentious terrain without losing public trust remains to be seen.","The FBI is under intense scrutiny following the New Orleans New Year’s Day attack.

Call for justice continues

In the past 24 hours, social media platform X has become the battleground for a heated debate on the alleged grooming gangs scandal in the UK. Public figures including Elon Musk , JK Rowling , and former Prime Minister Liz Truss have joined a growing chorus of voices demanding accountability over the UK's handling of child sexual abuse cases, particularly focusing on the Rotherham scandal that occurred between 1997 and 2013.Over a period spanning years, the Yorkshire town of Rotherham experienced one of Britain's most severe child exploitation cases. An independent inquiry found that no fewer than 1,400 minors were victimized through systematic abuse. The majority of victims were young girls who were targeted, manipulated, and trafficked by organized groups of men, most of whom were of Pakistani background.The crimes were compounded by institutional failures - despite victims repeatedly coming forward, law enforcement and social services consistently failed to take appropriate action or protect the children. The perpetrators used a combination of psychological manipulation, intimidation, and physical violence to maintain control over their victims.The debate intensified after Tesla CEO Elon Musk directly challenged current Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's role in these cases, pointing to his tenure as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) from 2008 to 2013. ""Who was the head of the CPS when rape gangs were allowed to exploit young girls without facing justice?"" Musk posted on social media platform X.Author JK Rowling weighed in on the controversy, taking issue with the terminology used to describe these crimes. She condemned the actions of the perpetrators and questioned whether there had been police corruption in the cases, referencing an article in The Telegraph by journalist Sam Ashworth-Hayes.Rowling wrote, ""The details emerging about what the rape gangs (why call them 'grooming' gangs? It's like calling those who stab people to death 'knife owners') did to girls in Rotherham are downright horrific. The allegations of possible police corruption in the case are almost beyond belief.""She described the emerging details about the Rotherham cases as ""downright horrific"" and expressed alarm at allegations of police corruption.The author’s blunt language echoed a sentiment that has become increasingly common among critics of the grooming gang scandal—redefining the term “grooming gangs” to emphasize the severity of the crimes.Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss also spoke out, condemning the perpetrators and the authorities who allowed the crimes to continue. In her post, she remarked, “These appalling rape gang cases of girls as young as 11 shame our country. Not only do the perpetrators need to be punished. So do the authorities who turned a blind eye in the name of not inflaming racial tensions.”Truss added, “The horrific failings on rape gangs show the complete lack of accountability in British criminal justice. The proper role of Lord Chancellor needs to be restored (to its pre-2005 state), and the judiciary should be accountable to them.”Truss emphasized the need for reform, saying that ministers should be able to hire and fire senior Home Office civil servants and police officers. According to her, the government must take responsibility and act to fix the country's justice system.Elon Musk, never one to shy away from controversy, has called out UK officials over the scandal, accusing them of failing to address the widespread abuse of young girls. Musk specifically pointed to current Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who served as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) between 2008 and 2013. In a tweet, Musk wrote: ""In the UK, serious crimes such as rape require the Crown Prosecution Service's approval for the police to charge suspects. Who was the head of the CPS when rape gangs were allowed to exploit young girls without facing justice? Keir Starmer, 2008 -2013.""The Tesla CEO’s criticism didn’t stop there. He also posted a message in support of Tommy Robinson , a British journalist and activist currently incarcerated, who has long been a vocal critic of the grooming gangs. Robinson had previously released a documentary detailing the extent of the abuse, which he alleges was covered up by authorities. Musk shared a tweet that read, “Free Tommy Robinson!” further amplifying the calls for justice.Tommy Robinson's official handle on X shared a tragic story about a victim, Nicole, who was allegedly raped and pimped out by a grooming gang at the age of 11 in Telford.Robinson's team, representing him on X while he remains in prison, continued to raise awareness about the issue.One post shared the heartbreaking story of a girl named Nicole, who was allegedly raped and trafficked at the age of 11 by members of a grooming gang in Telford, a city notorious for such crimes. The post condemned the authorities for their failure to intervene, noting that Robinson is ""languishing in solitary confinement in a high-security prison"" for exposing these abuses.The post read: “Nicole was raped and pimped at the age of 11 by members of a grooming gang in Telford, one of many, many cases in that area. A man is languishing in solitary confinement in a high-security prison because he dared to speak out and tell the truth about this scourge—the industrialised rape, pimping, and molestation of little girls by depraved adult men.”Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe also joined the conversation, sharing his fury over the scandal. He posted on X, “Reading these transcripts, these graphic descriptions—I am just so furious that our country allowed this to happen to those vulnerable young girls. It’s not ‘grooming’ gangs, it’s rape gangs—mass rape gangs. It makes me ashamed to be British.”Lowe further called for drastic action, urging for the deportation of foreign nationals involved in the abuse. “We must deport all foreign nationals involved in the rape gangs—stripping citizenship from dual nationals, and deporting them too,” he said.Newark MP Robert Jenrick, speaking as a father of girls the same age as the victims, also condemned the perpetrators. He pledged to continue his campaign for life sentences and the prosecution of all those involved in covering up the crimes.The alleged grooming gang scandal has its roots in incidents that took place between 1997 and 2013 in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where hundreds of girls were sexually exploited by gangs of men. On September 13, 2024, the Crown Prosecution Service revealed that seven men were jailed for committing child sex abuse offenses against two young girls in Rotherham during the 2000s.The case was part of Operation Stovewood, a major investigation by the National Crime Agency into child sexual abuse and exploitation in the town. The two victims in this case were just 11 and 15 years old when the abuse began.The CPS prosecution included Mohammed Amar (42), Mohammed Siyab (44), Yasser Ajaibe (39), Mohammed Zameer Sadiq (49), Abid Saddiq (43), Tahir Yassin (38), and Ramin Bari (37). These convictions were seen as a small step forward in bringing justice to the victims, but the scandal remains a dark stain on the UK’s history, with many feeling that authorities failed to act swiftly enough.As calls for justice continue to grow, it remains to be seen whether the UK government will take further action to address the systemic failures that allowed the grooming gangs to thrive for so long. MPs and celebrities are using their platforms to demand accountability, but the question remains: how many more vulnerable girls have been affected, and what will be done to prevent further exploitation?","Elon Musk and JK Rowling lead calls for justice over Pakistani grooming gangs.

DENVER: A gray wolf in Colorado was illegally shot and later died of the injury, federal authorities said Thursday in the latest flashpoint of Colorado's controversial, voter-driven initiative to reintroduce the predators to the state.Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock. The first 10 wolves were released a year ago, and since then there have been over two dozen claims of depredations - when wolves kill livestock or working dogs.The wolf was part of the Copper Creek Pack which was captured in late August after the pack repeatedly killed local livestock in Grand County, just northwest of Denver, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf died in early September and the investigation is ongoing.Officials said the wolf was found in poor condition, emaciated with injuries to its right hind leg, which a necropsy revealed was caused by the gunshot wound. Wolves are protected under the Endangered Species Act in the state, and it's a federal crime to kill, injure or harass them without federal authority.Colorado officials anticipate releasing 30 to 50 wolves within the next five years with the goal of filling one of the last major holes in the western US for the species, which in years past has ranged from northern Canada to the desert southwest.","Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock.

'A body came flying at me'

The bustling celebration of New Year’s Eve on Bourbon Street turned into a scene of terror when a speeding SUV, driven with apparent malicious intent, barreled onto the sidewalk, sending revelers scattering for their lives.In a chilling incident captured on video, the SUV was seen mounting the sidewalk outside a Krystal's burger restaurant around 3:15 am, narrowly missing a woman by inches as others scrambled to safety. Some darted into the street, while others sought refuge inside the fast-food joint. Miraculously, no injuries were reported, though the sheer chaos and panic reverberated through the French Quarter.Eyewitnesses described the sound of screeching tires and what appeared to be gunshots in the background, adding to the atmosphere of fear. The manager of the restaurant confirmed that no staff members were present at the time of the incident.The driver, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar , was later revealed to have swerved around makeshift barriers before plowing into the crowded area. Authorities confirmed that Jabbar’s rampage was a deliberate terror attack, leaving 15 dead and dozens injured.Witnesses reported the white pickup truck barreling through a barricade before careening into pedestrians on the crowded sidewalk.“All I saw was a truck slamming into everyone on the left side of Bourbon sidewalk,” recalled Kevin Garcia, 22, who narrowly avoided being struck. “A body came flying at me,” he said, his voice still shaking. Moments later, gunshots rang out as the driver exited the vehicle and engaged in a gunfight with law enforcement.Amid the pandemonium, Nicole Mowrer and her husband Jim sought refuge in a nearby alcove. “We heard gunfire, saw police running that direction,” she recounted. When the shooting ceased, they ventured into the street only to find bodies and injured victims strewn across the pavement.Authorities acted swiftly to secure the area and evacuate survivors, urging bystanders to put away their phones and leave immediately. “Police waved us where to walk and told us to get out fast,” said Whit Davis, 22, from Shreveport. “I saw a few dead bodies they couldn’t even cover up and tons of people receiving first aid.”By dawn, the scale of the carnage became clear. The New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) confirmed the incident as a mass casualty event, with the injured rushed to five local hospitals. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick described the driver as “hellbent on creating carnage and damage,” though authorities have not yet confirmed whether the attack was deliberate.Paul Mauro, a former NYPD inspector, emphasized the growing threat of vehicle-based attacks , stating, “A 5,000-pound truck at high speed causes utter devastation. Some of the worst crime scenes you’ll ever work as a cop or EMT are vehicle accidents.” Mauro urged law enforcement to prioritize such threats as part of their standard operating procedures.","A speeding SUV, driven with apparent malicious intent, barreled onto the sidewalk, sending revelers scattering for their lives.

Fort Bragg , home to the US Army's elite Psychological Operations Unit, has come under intense public and media scrutiny following a series of troubling incidents involving its former personnel. Billionaire Elon Musk added fuel to the fire by responding to online speculation with a cryptic comment: ""Good question.""The controversy centers on Matthew Livelsberger and Shamsud-Din Jabbar , two veterans who reportedly served at Fort Bragg and were later implicated in violent incidents . Livelsberger, a Green Beret with 19 years of service, was connected to a Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas.Jabbar, who also served in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, was linked to an attack in New Orleans. Their overlapping service at Fort Bragg has raised questions about whether the base's environment or psychological operations may have influenced their actions.Adding to the intrigue, both veterans reportedly supported former President Donald Trump, leading to theories of a broader psychological or political operation. Critics have pointed to Fort Bragg's history of collaboration with the CIA and its involvement in high-level psychological training programs as potential factors.Further complicating the narrative is the mention of Ryan Routh , who visited Fort Bragg over 100 times before attempting to assassinate Trump. Routh's connections, along with Livelsberger and Jabbar's actions, have sparked speculation about a network of radicalized individuals with ties to the base.Fort Bragg's role as a training ground for psychological operations has led some to question whether its personnel are more susceptible to manipulation or if its selection process targets individuals prone to radicalization.

Trump's statements come after a pickup truck drove into a crowd, killing at least 15 people in New Orleans, and an explosion occurred outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday.Trump posted on Truth Social that, under Biden's ""Open Borders Policy,"" he had repeatedly warned during rallies and elsewhere that radical Islamic terrorism and other forms of violent crime would become so severe in America that it would be difficult to imagine or believe. He claimed that this time had arrived and was worse than anticipated.“With the Biden ‘Open Border’s Policy’ I said, many times during Rallies, and elsewhere, that Radical Islamic Terrorism, and other forms of violent crime, will become so bad in America that it will become hard to even imagine or believe.

He claimed this was the result of open borders and weak, ineffective, and virtually nonexistent leadership. Trump alleged that the DOJ, FBI, and Democrat state and local prosecutors had failed to do their jobs, describing them as incompetent and corrupt, and accused them of unlawfully targeting him as a political opponent instead of focusing on protecting Americans from violent individuals who had infiltrated the government and the nation.“Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!

(U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Virginia via AP)

NORFOLK: Federal agents found one of the largest stockpiles of homemade explosives they have ever seized when they arrested a Virginia man on a firearms charge last month, according to a court filing by federal prosecutors. Investigators seized more than 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices when they searched the home of Brad Spafford northwest of Norfolk in December, the prosecutors said in a motion filed on Monday.The prosecutors wrote that this is believed to be ""the largest seizure by number of finished explosive devices in FBI history"".Most of the bombs were found in a detached garage at the home in Isle of Wight County, along with tools and bomb-making materials including fuses and pieces of plastic pipe, according to court documents.The prosecutors also wrote: ""Several additional apparent pipe bombs were found in a backpack in the home's bedroom, completely unsecured,"" in the home he shares with his wife and two young children.Spafford, 36, was charged with possession of a firearm in violation of the National Firearms Act. Law enforcement officers allege he owned an unregistered short barrel rifle. Prosecutors said that he faces ""numerous additional potential charges"" related to the explosives.Defence attorneys argued in a motion on Tuesday that authorities haven't produced evidence that he was planning violence, also noting that he has no criminal record. Further, they question whether the explosive devices were usable because ""professionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them"".""There is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,"" the defence lawyers wrote.Messages were left Wednesday seeking further comment from the defence lawyers who signed the motion, Lawrence Woodward and Jerry Swartz.The investigation began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend, told authorities Spafford had disfigured his hand in 2021 while working on homemade explosives.Prosecutors said he only has two fingers on his right hand. The informant told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of the president, an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, for target practice and that ""he believed political assassinations should be brought back,"" prosecutors wrote.Numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on December 17. The agents located the rifle and the explosive devices, some of which had been hand-labelled as ""lethal"" and some of which were loaded into a wearable vest, court documents state. Technicians detonated most of the devices on site because they were deemed unsafe to transport, though several were kept for analysis.At a hearing Tuesday, federal Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard determined that Spafford could be released into house arrest at his mother's home but agreed to keep him detained while the government files further arguments.In response, prosecutors reiterated why they believe Spafford is dangerous, writing that ""while he is not known to have engaged in any apparent violence, he has certainly expressed interest in the same, through his manufacture of pope bombs marked lethal his possession of riot gear and a vest loaded with pipe bombs, his support for political assassinations and use of the pictures of the President for target practice"".",Federal agents found one of the largest stockpiles of homemade explosives they have ever seized when they arrested a Virginia man on a firearms charge last month.

Are Tesla truck blast in Vegas & attack in New Orleans linked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/are-tesla-truck-blast-in-vegas-attack-in-new-orleans-linked/articleshow/116897712.cms,"LAS VEGAS: One person was killed and at least seven were injured after a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday morning, the authorities said. Gasoline canisters and large firework mortars were packed into the Cybertruck that burst into flames shortly after a driver intentionally drove a pickup truck into crowds celebrating the new year in the French Quarter of New Orleans, killing 14 people. The FBI is investigating whether there is any connection between the Cybertruck explosion and the truck attack, officials said.The sole occupant of the Cybertruck was found dead inside. Two officials, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity, identified the man as Matthew Livelsberger . Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners, the army said in a statement. He had served in the army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the army said. He was awarded two Bronze Stars, including one with a valour device for courage under fire. Livelsberger was on approved leave when he died, it said.Both Livelsberger and New Orleans suspect Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, an army veteran from Texas, spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive army base in North Carolina that is home to multiple special units. However, one official said there was no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty. Jabbar enlisted in army in 2007 and Livelsberger in 2006.Officials have not established a link between the events beyond superficial similarities: Both men chose soft targets on New Year's Day and rented trucks through the same budget car rental app, Turo. ""Law enforcement, intelligence community are investigating"" the Las Vegas explosion, ""including whether there is any possible connection to the attack in New Orleans,"" Prez Biden said. It reflected the heightened sense of alarm among law enforcement officials who are probing if the New Orleans attack involved a larger cell of IS sympathisers.Later on Thursday, Christopher Raia of FBI's counterterrorism division said there was no ""definitive connection"" between the two incidents. But he cautioned that investigators are early in their inquiry and have not ruled anything out.Clips taken by witnesses inside and outside the Las Vegas hotel showed the vehicle exploding and flames pouring out of it, as it sat outside the hotel at around 8.40am local time Wednesday. A Trump spokesman didn't respond. The Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas is part of the Trump Organisation, the company of Prez-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House on Jan. 20. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a key ally of Trump. ""Obviously a Cybertruck, the Trump hotel - there's lots of questions that we have to answer,"" Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said.Police said the truck was rented in Colorado, arrived in Las Vegas at around 7.30am and drove through the city's famed Strip, lined with hotels, casinos and entertainment venues, until it reached the hotel, where it stopped in the valet area. ""Detectives found gasoline canisters and large firework mortars in the bed of the truck,"" a police statement said. Musk said the blast was unrelated to 2024 model-year Cybertruck. ""The explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb,"" he wrote on X. ""All vehicle telemetry was positive."" Telemetry is automatic collection of data from remote sources for analysis. Turo said it didn't believe either renter ""had a criminal background that would've identified them as threat.""","The sole occupant of the Cybertruck was found dead inside.

'Matt was a supersoldier, could have made sophisticated explosives'



Did the gunshot cause the explosion?



'Everyone thought the world of Matt'



37-year-old Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger who shot himself in the head before his Tesla Cybertruck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas was a big supporter of Donald Trump and voted for him in November, his uncle Dean Livelsberger told the Independent. As Livelsberger chose a spot linked to President-elec Donald Trump and a car manufactured by Trump's aide Elon Musk, the FBI is not dismissing any political motivation but the report claimed that, if anything, the bomber was a fan of Trump -- and a registered Republican.Livelsberger was a Rambo-type., 100 per cent patriot, his uncle who was also in the Army said. “He used to have all patriotic stuff on Facebook, he was 100 percent loving the country,” Dean said. “He loved Trump, and he was always a very, very patriotic soldier, a patriotic American. It’s one of the reasons he was in Special Forces for so many years. It wasn’t just one tour of duty.”When Dean Livelsberger was interviewed, he was aware of the Las Vegas explosion but not of his nephew's connection with this. He was bewildered and said it did not make any sense that a skilled warrior and a patriot like Matt would cause an explosion like this -- an amateurish construction.“Matt was a very skilled warrior, and he would be able to make — if it was him, and if he did this — he would’ve been able to make a more sophisticated explosive than using propane tanks and camping fuel. He was what you might call a ‘supersoldier.’ If you ever read about the things he was awarded, and the experience he had, some of it doesn’t make sense, when he had the skills and ability to make something more, let’s say, ‘efficient.’ His skills were enormous from what he had been taught in the military.”Several questions remain unanswered as new details emerge in the case that Matthew Livelsberger shot himself in his head before the explosion. The explosion occurred immediately after the suicide. His motive is not clear. It is not confirmed whether he wanted to end his life and the explosion was an accident after the shooting.Livelsberger’s military ID and passport were found inside the Cybertruck, as well as a Desert Eagle .50 caliber semi-automatic pistol and an SLR Rifleworks B30. Both weapons, and Livelsberger himself, were burnt almost beyond recognition, police said. Investigators also recovered a cache of fireworks, along with an iPhone, a smartwatch, and several credit cards in Livelsberger’s name.The firearms were legally purchased on December 30.His uncle said Livelsberger was not estranged from his family and he just had a newborn with his partner. Livelsberger divorced his first wife several years ago who now lives in South Florida with her new husband. Livelsberger has a new partner and the two have a child.","Matthew Livelsberger, 37, shot himself in the head before his Tesla Cybertruck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.

Matthew Livelsberger's Donald Trump-Elon Musk connection



Was Vegas Cybertruck explosion a suicide incident?



37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger , a military man, who was found dead as a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, shot himself in the head before the truck exploded. Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters that there was a self-inflicted gunshot wound on his head. A gun was found in the destroyed vehicle. The body was badly burnt and it was unrecognizable.""The individual had sustained a gunshot wound to the head prior to the detonation of the vehicle. One of the handguns was found at his feet inside of the vehicle..."" police said.The Cybertruck incident was initially thought of as a terror attack as it took place hours after the New Orleans mass carnage. The two incidents had eerie links like both the suspected attackers rented their trucks on Turo; both served in the Army; the Cybertruck man was still in the Army when he died; and once they served in the same military base. However, the FBI clarified that the New Orleans ISIS man acted alone. But investigators have not yet found the real nature of the Cybertruck explosion.FBI special agent Spencer Evans said that the FBI was looking into the possibility that the attack was politically motivated given that it occurred at a hotel owned by president-elect Donald Trump and with a vehicle from Trump-ally Elon Musk. “It’s not lost on us that it happened in front of the Trump building and a Tesla vehicle was used,” Evans said.So far, law enforcement does not believe Livelsberger had any help carrying out the explosion, with surveillance cameras tracking him all alone on his trip from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas.Matthew Livelsberger has been in the Army since 2006 and was a Special Forces soldier with drone pilot training. On the day of the explosion, he was an active Army man with his latest role from November 2024 being a Remote and Autonomous Systems Manager for the Army.As more details about his education and military career emerged, several questions cropped up on the nature of the explosion. The explosive materials that were found inside his car were all combustible but they were not effective for a large-scale explosion. With his military and technical knowledge, Livelsberger was supposed to know that a Tesla cybertruck would minimise the effect of the explosion. It is not yet known whether Livelsberger chose cybertruck for that very reason as he did not probably want anyone else to be affected.","Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was found dead as a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week.Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.
