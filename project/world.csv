"'US did it, why can't Pakistan?': Indian envoy demands Hafiz Saeed's extradition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-did-it-why-cant-pakistan-indian-envoy-demands-hafiz-saeeds-extradition/articleshow/121280078.cms,"Hafiz Saeed (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India's ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, has said that Operation Sindoor , launched in response to crossborder terrorism from Pakistan, is only ""paused"" and ""not over"".In an interview with Israeli news channel i24, Singh called for the formation of a global coalition against terrorism and drew parallel with the example of Tahawwur Rana 's extradition by US. Indian envoy demanded that Pakistan should also hand over key terror figures, including LeT chief Hafiz Saeed , Sajid Mir, and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.Recounting the events leading up to the operation, Singh referred to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, in which 26 civilians were killed after being targeted based on their religion. He said India's response was focused specifically on terrorist groups and their infrastructure within Pakistan.However, he added that Pakistan responded by attacking Indian military installations.""The terrorists killed people based on their religion,"" Singh said. ""India's operation was against terror groups and their infrastructure to which Pakistan responded by attacking India's military installations.""When asked if the ceasefire signalled an end to the conflict, Singh responded that the operation had only been paused. ""The ceasefire is still holding on but we have made it very clear that Operation Sindoor is paused, it's not yet over,"" he said. ""Wherever terrorists are, we have to kill those terrorists and we have to destroy their infrastructure.""Singh described the Indian airstrike on Pakistan’s Nur Khan base on May 10 as a game changer. He claimed the strike caused panic in Pakistan and prompted its Director General of Military Operations to reach out to India seeking a ceasefire.On the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty , which Pakistan has described as an act of war, Singh said that India could no longer uphold a treaty based on goodwill and friendship while facing constant terrorist attacks from across the border. He pointed out that although India continued to allow water to flow to Pakistan, the latter allowed terror to flow in the opposite direction. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s view that ""blood and water cannot flow together"" reflected the public's growing frustration, which led to the suspension of the treaty.""Terror must stop,"" Singh said, stressing that any treaty could only function if Pakistan ended its support for terrorism. He added, ""While IWT is in abeyance, another IWT is operational - Operation Sindoor is India's War Against Terrorism.""Singh named Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad as the two core groups behind the long list of terror attacks in India and said their leaders continue to roam freely in Pakistan. He said Pakistan could defuse tensions simply by handing over the key individuals India has long demanded.""They need to do a very simple thing - when the preamble includes goodwill and friendship, they just need to hand over these terrorists to us,"" he said.Referring again to the US example, Singh questioned why Pakistan could not follow the same path. ""When the US can hand over these culprits, why can't Pakistan hand over? They have to simply hand over Hafeez Saeed, Lakhvi, Sajid Mir and things will be over,"" he said.Singh dismissed Pakistan’s offer to investigate the Pahalgam attack as a tactic to deflect attention. He questioned what had come of earlier investigations into the Mumbai, Pathankot, and Pulwama attacks. ""We have given them dossiers after dossiers - we have given them technical inputs. America has shared with them evidence. Everything is there but what have they done?"" he asked.He mentioned that despite being named as planners and executioners of the Mumbai attack, Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed remain at large. ""So we can't believe them,"" he added.Pointing out that terrorism is a global threat, Singh called for deeper cooperation among affected nations. ""At an international level, all those countries including India, Israel and many other countries that face the brunt of terrorism, we need to expand our diplomatic reach, we need to cooperate, we need to form a coalition against terrorism and most importantly against the supporters of these terrorist groups.""He also added that by underlining India's unwavering position. ""Our prime minister has made it very clear - very clear - that we have zero tolerance on terrorism. We are not going to accept this cross-border terrorism .""","India's ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, has said that Operation Sindoor is only ""paused"" and ""not over"" Singh called for the formation of a global coalition against terrorism and drew parallel with the example of Tahawwur Rana's extradition by US. Indian envoy demanded that Pakistan should also hand over key terror figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280369,imgsize-618528,width-400,resizemode-4/utt-30.jpg"
"From Rawalpindi to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, India can strike anywhere in Pakistan, says Army official",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-rawalpindi-to-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-india-can-strike-anywhere-in-pakistan-says-army-general/articleshow/121279718.cms,"Soldiers practice military drills with heavy artillery (AP Photo), and Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha (ANI).

NEW DELHI: Director general of Army Air Defence, Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha , on Monday said that India has the capability to strike targets anywhere within Pakistan. Speaking in the context of Operation Sindoor , he explained that the Indian armed forces are fully prepared to respond across the entire depth of Pakistani territory if needed.In an interview with news agency ANI, Lt Gen D'Cunha said, ""The whole of Pakistan is within range."" He added that even if the Pakistan Army moves its General Headquarters (GHQ) from Rawalpindi to areas like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), they would have to ""find a deep hole.""During Operation Sindoor, India carried out strikes on important Pakistani airbases using loitering munitions to hit key targets.Lt Gen D'Cunha said, ""I just like to say that India has an adequate arsenal of weapons to take on Pakistan right across its depth. So, from its broadest to its narrowest, wherever it is, the whole of Pakistan is within range. We are absolutely capable, from our borders or even in depth, where we can take on the entire Pakistan. And the GHQ can move from Rawalpindi to KPK or wherever they want to move, but they are all within range, so they will have to really find a deep hole.""He said that Indian forces used locally developed technology, including long-range drones and guided munitions, which played a role in the operation.Lt Gen D'Cunha also said that the armed forces are responsible for protecting the country and its people.""Our job is to protect our sovereignty, our people... So, I think that the very fact that we have been able to protect our motherland from this onslaught, which was aimed at causing a lot of problems in population centers and in our cantonments, the very fact that we have given this reassurance to our people, not only to our civil population... a lot of our own jawans, officers, wives were staying in cantonments. And they were also equally concerned about these drone attacks. And the very fact that we ensured that this did not manifest in any casualties, I am sure it not only made the soldier feel proud, it made the families feel proud. And finally, the population of India feel proud. I think that's the takeaway.""Le Gen D'Cunha also highlighted India's preparedness in modern warfare, particularly in neutralising drones and other advanced technologies during Operation Sindoor.""The Russia-Ukraine clash and even to some extent the Israeli current conflict, taught us about the huge capability that drones have. We realised that Pakistan, by its backend support from Turkey and maybe a northern adversary as well, had a plethora of drones. We also knew that in order to take on an effective air defence integrated system that we have, they (Pakistan) would have to saturate us. So, if you see his concept of employment, they (Pakistan) would first send in low-altitude, cheaper drones in large numbers to saturate your radars, and they would also force you to open up your radars...We anticipated this, and about maybe on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, we did a simulation exercise at the behest of our army chief in the border areas, where we simulated drone attacks on the weapon system. It was not from the border, but it was internal, on the border... We started at 5:30 in the morning, maybe on the 26th for the first day, when multiple drones were coming in to train our people,"" he said.India had launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting nine terror-related sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.This was in response to a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam last month, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. Following India’s strike, Pakistan retaliated with shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir, along with attempted drone attacks along the border.After Pakistan's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase. Both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on May 10.","Director general of Army Air Defence, Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha, said India has the capability to strike targets anywhere within Pakistan.

Prioritising retired servicemen, many of whom already receive pensions, over unemployed young people risks deepening the sense of alienation,” Mehbooba’s letter reads.Urging the administration to reconsider, or at least clarify the rationale behind the policy, Mehbooba called for more inclusive models to address security and socio-economic challenges in J&K.“This soaring unemployment is not just an economic issue but a social emergency. With few opportunities amidst utter despondency, many youngsters are falling into the grip of drug addiction and, tragically, some are even driven to suicide. We must come to their rescue by being more mindful of their future.”Governing National Conference spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said the issue was beyond the UT govt’s jurisdiction as it came under security-related expenditure (SRE).BJP spokesman Arun Gupta rejected Mehbooba Mufti’s opposition. He said the Indian Army has shaped these men into highly capable soldiers trained to meet any eventuality. “We are extremely fortunate as a nation to have such manpower at our disposal,” the BJP spokesman said.“We must recognize the unmatched training and discipline these personnel possess. Their deployment in sensitive civil installations is not just logical, it’s essential. Security today is not about hardware alone; it’s about the right people with the right experience,” the spokesman said.He said the initiative wasn’t rolled out overnight. “It took three years of careful planning, clearances, and evaluation. The govt has acted with deliberation and responsibility, and the outcome reflects a strategic approach to both security and manpower utilisation,” he added.","The Union govt has rejected PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s objection to the J&K govt approving the mobilisation of 4,000 ex-servicemen to guard vital infrastructure across the Union territory.

'Mamata forced Yusuf to withdraw from delegation'



NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Yusuf Pathan has opted out of the all-party delegation after Centre chose him as party's representative, PTI reported citing party sources. The TMC indicated that the selection was ""unilateral"" and it should have been ""decided by the respective party leadership.""Although the exact reason for Pathan's decision remains unclear, both West Bengal chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee asserted that the Centre should not have the authority to choose the party's representative for the delegation.Meanwhile, the move was criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Malviya calling it unfortunate, saying that this ""should have been kept above partisan politics. Members of Parliament are representatives of the people as well.""Mamata Banerjee, however, categorically mentioned that the party did not intend to boycott the delegation.""It is wrong to say that we are boycotting or not going. They need to inform the party. The parliamentary party discusses the bills in the Parliament. It takes decisions regarding the Parliament, and that too, after consulting with the party. I am the chairperson of the parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha,"" she said.""However, we are never informed. We will definitely send a representative if they inform us. Why wouldn't we? There is no point of controversy here. We are fully with the government,"" she added.""The Centre cannot unilaterally decide who will represent which party. This has to be decided by the respective party leadership. If you ask for one representative, we will give you five names. But the Centre also needs to show its good intent and call for a wider deliberation with all parties in the opposition,"" Abhishek Banerjee said.Malviya attacked the Bengal CM claiming that she ""forced"" the TMC MP to ""withdraw from the multi-party delegation"".""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to force the TMC MP to withdraw from the multi-party delegation is unfortunate. This is a Government of India delegation and should have been kept above partisan politics. Members of Parliament are representatives of the people as well,"" he said in a post on X.""It sends a subliminal message that Mamata Banerjee and her party are unwilling to speak out against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. What is worse is that while a caucus of senior party apparatchiks prevailed—likely because they were not part of the delegation—other senior TMC MPs are now sending feelers to be included. After all, it is a matter of national pride to represent the country at such a moment,"" he added.Congress party has also questioned the Centre's selection criteria for the delegation calling it ""dishonest"" after it rejected all the four names suggested by the grand old party and chose Shashi Tharoor among others.The Centre on Sunday unveiled a list of seven delegations comprising political leaders, parliamentarians, and former ministers from various parties, tasked with presenting India’s firm stance against terrorism in the wake of Operation Sindoor."," Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Yusuf Pathan has opted out of the all-party delegation after Centre chose him as party's representative.

No restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in near future: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-restoration-of-normalcy-with-pakistan-in-near-future-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/121279714.cms,"NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri , during a meeting of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, categorically stated that the call for pause in Indo-Pakistan hostilities was taken after DGMO-to-DGMO talks, rebutting Trump's claims about brokering the end of hostilities on May 10 - the subject making for animated questions from MPs, who questioned why did the govt allow Trump to take centre stage and did not officially contradict his claims.Misri is learnt to have added that Trump made his claims about ""ceasefire"" on social media, and not through any official channel, where India could have put its point across. At the same time, the top official underlined that Trump had since modified his statement on ""mediation"" by toning it down to ""help"". MEA also said no other country has any locus standi to comment on issues of J&K.Significantly, the over two-hour-long in-camera session saw the foreign secretary ruling out restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in near future.Questioned repeatedly, Misri informed panel members that Pakistan's DGMO Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah made the first attempt to establish contact with his Indian counterpart at 9.15 am on May 10. However, Indian DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai was by that time in a huddle with top officials and could not take the call. Shortly afterwards, officials from the Pakistan high commission reached out to MEA to inform it of the Pakistani DGMO's attempt to reach Ghai, after which the two had a brief, first, conversation at 1.15 pm. The first round in which the Pakistan DGMO conveyed willingness to cease hostilities was followed by a formal conversation at 3.30 pm, leading to an understanding on the pause.The timeline provided by foreign secretary corroborated the report previously published by TOI in this regard.The parliamentary panel is headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and comprises Ravi Shankar Prasad, Asaduddin Owaisi, Sudhanshu Trivedi Abhishek Banerjee, Sagarika Ghose, Rajeev Shukla, John Brittas, Aparajita Sarangi, AD Singh, Deepender Singh Hooda. A record 24 members, including the chairperson, attended the meet.Misri also told the panel that the conflict had completely remained in the conventional domain, and there was no nuclear signalling from Pakistan, sources said - a contradiction of the reports that Pakistan had brandished nuclear threat during the face-off, with some even claiming that the threat had led to the US to intervene.To questions about Pakistan using Chinese weapons, Misri said India had hammered nine Pakistani air bases, and the platforms Pakistan used to launch weapons were immaterial.The meeting witnessed a lot of queries about Turkiye coming out in support of Pakistan, with a senior member stating that India had old relations with Turkey. But Misri responded that Turkiye had traditionally not been a supporter of India. He also denied that India was diplomatically isolated during the conflict.Meanwhile, MEA told MPs that Pakistan has been making ""baseless allegations"" of India sponsoring terrorism and carrying out extra-judicial killings in Pakistan. ""These allegations are intended to draw a false equivalence between India and Pakistan as both being victims of cross-border terrorism, which was not the case. Pakistan's track record as a terror sanctuary is well-established and rooted in solid facts and evidence,"" it said.Misri denied that foreign minister S Jaishankar had informed Pakistan about India's attack, as has been made out from his video comment. He said the minister was referring to just after the first phase of 'Operation Sindoor' when India had carried out attacks on Pakistan terror bases.","Foreign secretary Vikram Misri categorically stated that the call for pause in Indo-Pakistan hostilities was taken after DGMO-to-DGMO talks.

NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri , during a meeting of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, categorically stated that the call for pause in Indo-Pakistan hostilities was taken after DGMO-to-DGMO talks, rebutting Trump's claims about brokering the end of hostilities on May 10 - the subject making for animated questions from MPs, who questioned why did the govt allow Trump to take centre stage and did not officially contradict his claims.Misri is learnt to have added that Trump made his claims about ""ceasefire"" on social media, and not through any official channel, where India could have put its point across. At the same time, the top official underlined that Trump had since modified his statement on ""mediation"" by toning it down to ""help"". MEA also said no other country has any locus standi to comment on issues of J&K.Significantly, the over two-hour-long in-camera session saw the foreign secretary ruling out restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in near future.Questioned repeatedly, Misri informed panel members that Pakistan's DGMO Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah made the first attempt to establish contact with his Indian counterpart at 9.15 am on May 10. However, Indian DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai was by that time in a huddle with top officials and could not take the call. Shortly afterwards, officials from the Pakistan high commission reached out to MEA to inform it of the Pakistani DGMO's attempt to reach Ghai, after which the two had a brief, first, conversation at 1.15 pm. The first round in which the Pakistan DGMO conveyed willingness to cease hostilities was followed by a formal conversation at 3.30 pm, leading to an understanding on the pause.The timeline provided by foreign secretary corroborated the report previously published by TOI in this regard.The parliamentary panel is headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and comprises Ravi Shankar Prasad, Asaduddin Owaisi, Sudhanshu Trivedi Abhishek Banerjee, Sagarika Ghose, Rajeev Shukla, John Brittas, Aparajita Sarangi, AD Singh, Deepender Singh Hooda. A record 24 members, including the chairperson, attended the meet.Misri also told the panel that the conflict had completely remained in the conventional domain, and there was no nuclear signalling from Pakistan, sources said - a contradiction of the reports that Pakistan had brandished nuclear threat during the face-off, with some even claiming that the threat had led to the US to intervene.To questions about Pakistan using Chinese weapons, Misri said India had hammered nine Pakistani air bases, and the platforms Pakistan used to launch weapons were immaterial.The meeting witnessed a lot of queries about Turkiye coming out in support of Pakistan, with a senior member stating that India had old relations with Turkey. But Misri responded that Turkiye had traditionally not been a supporter of India. He also denied that India was diplomatically isolated during the conflict.Meanwhile, MEA told MPs that Pakistan has been making ""baseless allegations"" of India sponsoring terrorism and carrying out extra-judicial killings in Pakistan. ""These allegations are intended to draw a false equivalence between India and Pakistan as both being victims of cross-border terrorism, which was not the case. Pakistan's track record as a terror sanctuary is well-established and rooted in solid facts and evidence,"" it said.Misri denied that foreign minister S Jaishankar had informed Pakistan about India's attack, as has been made out from his video comment. He said the minister was referring to just after the first phase of 'Operation Sindoor' when India had carried out attacks on Pakistan terror bases.",Vikram Misri categorically stated that the call for pause in Indo-Pakistan hostilities was taken after DGMO-to-DGMO talks.

Yes, absolutely No, he should continue his work





Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer , his office announced on Sunday.His diagnosis follows recent medical checks that revealed a worrying development.Biden was seen by doctors earlier this week after showing urinary symptoms . A routine physical exam had uncovered a small nodule in his prostate, prompting further tests. By Friday, doctors confirmed the presence of prostate cancer, with cells having already spread to his bones.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,"" his office said in a statement. ""The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”Prostate cancers are rated with a Gleason score from 1 to 10, showing how abnormal the cancer cells look compared to healthy ones. Biden’s score of 9 means his cancer is very aggressive.Earlier this week, both ABC News and The New York Times reported that Biden had undergone a medical evaluation following the discovery of the prostate nodule. According to the NYT, he spent Friday in a Philadelphia hospital undergoing additional examinations.“This 82-year-old former US President Joe Biden is undergoing medical evaluation after doctors discovered a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical exam,” a spokesperson told ABC News on Tuesday.Biden’s medical history has often drawn public attention, particularly during and after his presidency. In February 2023, while still in office, he had a lesion removed from his chest. White House physician Dr Kevin O’Connor later confirmed it was basal cell carcinoma . “All cancerous tissue was successfully removed. … No further treatment is required,” O’Connor said at the time.He explained that although basal cell carcinoma usually does not spread like other skin cancers, it can grow larger if left untreated. “They do, however, have the potential to increase in size, resulting in a more significant issue as well as increased challenges for surgical removal.”Before taking office, Biden also underwent Mohs surgery to remove non-melanoma skin cancers. In 2023, O’Connor noted that the biopsy site had “healed nicely” and added that Biden would continue with regular skin check-ups.Despite being declared “fit for duty” by O’Connor as recently as February 2024, Biden continued to face public doubts about his age and mental clarity. These concerns were widely believed to have influenced his decision to step away from the 2024 re-election race.Since leaving office in January, Biden has kept a relatively low profile but has appeared in the media a few times, including interviews after US President Trump’s first 100 days back in the White House.","Biden was seen by doctors earlier this week after showing urinary symptoms.

The Odisha Police have started an investigation into the alleged links between a Puri-based YouTuber and 'Pak spy' Jyoti Malhotra. On Saturday, May 17, Haryana Police arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra on the charge of passing sensitive information to Pakistani intelligence operatives.

According to Police, Jyoti Malhotra visited Puri in Odisha in September 2024 and came in contact with a woman who is also a YouTuber. The Puri SP Vinit Agrawa said that the Youtuber had also travelled to Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan recently. “We found that Jyoti Malhotra had visited Puri last year, and we are verifying the fact. Anything more can be shared after the verification,” Agrawal said.Asked whether the woman from Puri had shared intelligence inputs with Malhotra, Agrawal said, “The Haryana Police are investigating the matter and we are providing them the required assistance.” The police are also ""examining the objective"" of Malhotra's visit to Puri, and trying to find out ""where she stayed, whom she contacted and any possible suspicious activities"", the Puri SP said.In a social media post, Puri YouTuber wrote, “Jyoti was just a friend of mine, and I came in contact with her through YouTube.

The SIT has been asked to submit a status report by May 28.“We are a country which follows rule of law and it is same for the highest to the lowest,” the bench observed.The Supreme Court was hearing Vijay Shah’s plea seeking the quashing of an FIR lodged against him for his derogatory remarks . When asked whether he had apologised, his counsel said an apology had already been issued. However, the court questioned its authenticity and intent.According to Live Law, Justice Surya Kant remarked: “The nature of this matter... we are carrying the video clips... we would like to see what kind of apology you have tendered... there is a meaning of the word 'apology'... sometimes only to wriggle out of consequences... sometimes crocodile tears... what sort is yours?”The bench stayed Vijay Shah’s arrest but cautioned that the matter would not be allowed to become political. “He must face consequences. Let law take its own course. We will not allow this to be politicized,” Justice Kant told the state government.Describing the upcoming SIT investigation as a “litmus test” for the Madhya Pradesh government, the court made it clear that it would closely monitor the case.Vijay Shah in a public meeting referring to India's offensive against Pakistan after Pahalgam terror attack said, ""Modi ji sent their own sister (Col Sophia Qureshi) to take revenge""","Supreme Court rejects Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah's apology for his controversial remarks against Army officer.

Ali Khan Mahmudabad: Ashoka University Professor in Lockup as Colleagues Hold Vigil in Shifts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/professor-in-lockup-ashoka-colleagues-keep-vigil-at-rai-police-station-in-shifts/articleshow/121276380.cms,"Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an Ashoka University professor, was arrested following a complaint regarding his comments on Operation Sindoor, leading to charges including endangering India's sovereignty.





RAI (SONIPAT): Colleagues of Ali Khan Mahmudabad are keeping him company in ""rotating shifts"" at Rai police station's lockup in Sonipat, where he has spent a night since his arrest on Sunday morning and will spend another before the local court hears the case again on Tuesday afternoon.The court has, meanwhile, instructed police to fully cooperate in case of any medical emergency with Mahmudabad's wife in the advanced stages of pregnancy.Colleagues have decided they will ensure the 42-year-old professor is not alone for a moment while he is incarcerated.""We're coming here in shifts to ensure someone from the university is always with him. Around 10 faculty members have come to the police station to ensure Mahmudabad has access to basics like food and diabetes medicines. He wears a glucose monitor. The police are slow to respond to requests but are taking care of his medical needs. There has been no mistreatment,"" faculty member of Ashoka University told TOI on Monday.Mahmudabad was arrested after police cited a complaint by Haryana State Women's Commission chairperson Renu Bhatia to file an FIR under various sections of BNS, including ""endangering India's sovereignty"" for his comments on Operation Sindoor. The police complaint followed a summons from the panel that Mahmudabad – associate professor who heads the political science department – skipped, though he issued an elaborate clarification that the panel had completely misunderstood his comments that were made in a social media post on May 9.The Ashoka University faculty association on Sunday condemned the arrest and described it as ""calculated harassment"", with several of Mahmudabad's colleagues – besides many other voices in and beyond academia that have since come out in Mahmudabad's support – pointing out that his post had, in fact, praised the Indian Army, denounced warmongering by a section of people, and supported govt's actions against Pakistan. They have found his arrest confounding.""The comments made by Prof Ali, while seen as inappropriate by the complainant, do not warrant arrest in a democratic country. It is completely disproportionate to the alleged offence,"" a faculty member told TOI.In her police complaint, Bhatia alleged that when the commission visited the university on May 15 – after Mahmudabad skipped the May 14 summons – they could not find him because ""the professor was believed to have been sent away or hidden"". She also alleged university officials did not cooperate.Faculty members TOI spoke to said the commission's visit coincided with the end of the university semester. At this time, after completing grading, professors are typically away from campus, travelling for research or visiting family. In any case, Mahmudabad lives off-campus in Delhi and commutes daily. His absence from campus was ""normal for the end of the semester"", the faculty members said, adding should the commission have wanted to meet any other professor, it's likely they too would have been away.Mahmudabad's absence, explained a faculty member, was purely due to the academic calendar, and was in no way an intentional attempt to evade the commission.Kapil Dev Balyan, one of Mahmudabad's lawyers, told TOI arguments on Sunday at the local Sonipat court where the associate professor was produced lasted for almost five hours.Police sources had earlier told TOI they had sought remand for five days. The court granted two.""The police proposed investigating the matter in the professor's local area of Lucknow, which the defence opposed,"" Balyan said. ""There are two FIRs against the professor, number 146 and 147. FIR 146 stems from a complaint filed by Yogesh Jatheri, a village sarpanch. While details are mentioned in the FIR, the story was manipulated and presented differently. As the matter is now sub judice, further comments on the specifics would be inappropriate,"" he added.","Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an Ashoka University professor, was arrested following a complaint regarding his comments on Operation Sindoor.

FIR against Jyoti Malhotra



YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra was arrested by Civil Lines police in Hisar, Haryana on charges of spying for Pakistan. A day after her arrest, photos of the influencer with a man who delivered cake at Pakistan High Commission after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam have surfaced online.One such post has been shared by an X user - Being Political @BeingPolitical1. The post references an old video from April this year showing a man carrying a cake delivery box to the Pakistan HIgh Commission in Delhi. The video then went viral after the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians.The same man has been spotted in one of the videos on the YouTube channel of Jyoti Malhotra. He is now linked to a broader espionage scandal involving Jyoti Malhotra, who has been arrested for sharing sensitive Indian military information with Pakistani intelligence operatives, highlighting concerns about foreign influence and security breaches.Jyoti Malhotra runs a YouTube channel ""Travel with JO"" and has travelled to several countries, including Pakistan. She has 3.77 lakh subscribers on YouTube and 1.33 lakh followers on Instagram.According to the FIR, investigators claim she was asked by Pakistani handlers to promote a positive image of Pakistan through her social media posts.During questioning, Malhotra said she was part of a group that visited Pakistan in 2023. The FIR states that during this visit, she met a man named Ahsan-ur-Rahim, also known as Danish. After returning to India, she stayed in touch with him through WhatsApp and other messaging apps.Later, during another visit to Pakistan, reportedly on Ahsan’s advice, she met Ali Ahsan, who introduced her to members of Pakistani intelligence and security services.Police say that after this meeting, Jyoti Malhotra began sharing sensitive information with her contacts in Pakistan. She is also accused of saving their contact numbers under fake names to avoid detection. Investigators believe this was done on purpose to hide her communication with Pakistani intelligence officers.Malhotra maintained regular contact with Pakistani intelligence operatives and shared sensitive information through platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram and Snapchat. She reportedly saved Shahbaz's mobile number as 'Jatt Randhawa' to avoid any suspicion.","Jyoti Malhotra was arrested by Civil Lines police in Hisar, Haryana on charges of spying for Pakistan.

Why is Trump admin giving $5 million amount to family of January 6 rioter Ashli Babbitt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-settles-30-million-lawsuit-awards-5-million-to-family-of-january-6-rioter-ashli-babbitt/articleshow/121281585.cms,"Micki Witthoeft, center, mother of Ashli Babbitt (File photo AP)





The Trump administration has agreed to pay around $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, in order to settle a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by Babbitt estate, according to Associated Press. She was shot and killed during Capitol ill riots on January 6, 2021.Babbitt was attempting to breach her way into the US house speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, when the Trump supporter was shot dead by a capital police officer, which on investigation was determined as an act of self-defence and defence of members of Congress.The prosecutors said earlier this month in a hearing that the settlement agreement has been reached, though the details of it were not made public back then. On May 2, lawyers for Babbitt's estate and the justice department told a federal judge that they had reached a settlement in principle but were still working out the details before a final agreement could be signed.The lawsuit alleges that Ashli(35), an air force veteran, was unarmed when she was shot, and the police officer failed to de-escalate the situation and give any warning command before opening fire. It also accuses Capitol police of negligence, that the department should have known that the officer was ""prone to behave in a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner.""In April 2021, US Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia absolved the officer of any wrongdoing, and that no federal law was broken. The justice department determined that there was “no evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer willfully” used unlawful or unreasonable force.The settlement has received criticism from multiple quarters as well.In a statement on Monday, Capitol police chief Tom Manger said he was “extremely disappointed and disagrees with this settlement.”“In 2021, the DOJ investigation determined no wrongdoing by police. This settlement sends a chilling message to law enforcement nationwide, especially to those with a protective mission like ours,” Manger said.House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, referred to the deal as a “slap in the face” of American people.The Democratic leader said that the settlement was “totally done without any communication to the chief of the Capitol police or his lawyers, and appears solely the result of a political determination that Donald Trump and Republicans are going to try to whitewash what happened on January 6.“This settlement is just an extension of what they’ve previously done, which is to pardon violent felons who violently attacked the Capitol on January 6, including police officers, and now have all been pardoned and sent back to communities across the country where in some cases they’re re-engaging in criminal activity,” he added.After President Donald Trump addressed his January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally, a mob of thousands stormed the Capital, more than 100 police officers were injured in the attack.In January, on his first day back in the White House, Trump pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of charges for all of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in the riot.","The Trump administration has agreed to pay around $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, in order to settle a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit.

McIver calls her arrest 'purely political,' says ICE agents created 'unnecessary and unsafe confrontation'







The acting New Jersey US attorney on Monday said that she is charging Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault for allegedly confronting law enforcement officers outside a Newark immigration detention facility.Acting New Jersey US Attorney Alina Habba announced the criminal charges on social media, stating, ""Today my office has charged Congresswoman McIver with violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 111(a)(1) for assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement.""Video evidence shows McIver's confrontation with ICE agents outside the facility.The incident occurred at the Delaney Hall Detention Centre on May 9, where several Democratic lawmakers were present. During the event, Democratic Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at the facility, which maintains contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Habba explained that she attempted to resolve the situation without pressing charges. ""I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she unfortunately declined,"" she stated.""No one is above the law – politicians or otherwise,"" the US attorney added. ""It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are.""""Now we will let the justice system work.""The homeland security department released a video spanning nearly two minutes, showing McIver on the facility's side of a chain link fence before the mayor's arrest.

In the crowded scene, her elbows make contact with an officer wearing a face covering and olive green uniform marked ""Police"".Reacting to the charges, McIver, who claimed that she went with her colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall, said that it was the ICE who created an ""unnecessary and unsafe confrontation"" when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka.""Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall in my district. We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short. Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,"" she said.""The charges against me are purely political—they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight. This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right. I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court,"" she added.Meanwhile, Paul Fishman, McIver's counsel and former US attorney for New Jersey, denounced the charges against her as ""spectacularly inappropriate"". He emphasised that she visited Delaney Hall to fulfil her congressional duties of monitoring ICE's detainee treatment.Fishman stated that ICE agents transformed a potentially peaceful situation into disorder. He asserted that this prosecution attempts to deflect ICE's conduct onto Congresswoman McIver, emphasising that factual evidence, not media coverage, would be decisive in court.","Democratic Rep.

Prosecutors identified some substances as ketamine and MDMA.Cassie detailed Combs' specific requirements for intimate encounters, including constantly burning aromatic candles that she described as 'super pungent and were mixed with oil and all of the other scents.' She also mentioned his preference for heated baby oil.Whilst Combs maintains his innocence in the sex trafficking and racketeering charges, his legal team argues the evidence pertains to consensual gatherings.Special Agent Yasin Binda from Homeland Security Investigations testified about discovering suggestive items and substances in Combs' room.

Labor impacts







WASHINGTON: When armed immigration agents made a surprise visit earlier this month to Pupatella , a trendy pizzeria in the US capital's Dupont neighborhood, they may not have made any arrests, but they delivered a clear message.The show of force, part of an ""enhanced operation"" by President Donald Trump's hardline administration, has had ripple effects through an industry reliant on immigrant labor, owners and others in the sector say.The agents asked to see employment eligibility forms known as I-9s, said Natasha Neely, vice president of Pupatella, which has several locations in the Washington area.""They did not have a warrant, and they did not have any form of paperwork, so they were turned away,"" she told AFP.A few hours later, agents showed up at Pupatella's Capitol Hill location, this time with a ""notice of inspection,"" Neely said. The manager referred them to the restaurant's corporate office.The immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agency said it had arrested 189 undocumented migrants after handing out 187 such notices in the Washington area between May 6 and May 9.In a press release, it described the activity as an ""enhanced targeted immigration enforcement operation focusing on criminal alien offenders.""While the inspection notices are not unusual, Neely said, they are normally delivered by e-mail due to their administrative nature.""We have never experienced anything like this,"" she said, expressing confusion about why the restaurant had been targeted.Trump has made deporting undocumented immigrants a key priority for his second term, after successfully campaigning against an alleged ""invasion"" by criminals.So far, his administration has deported tens of thousands of migrants, with US courts hearing cases on allegations that the government violated due process in certain cases.Undocumented migrants are ""the backbone of our industry. From top to bottom,"" Shawn Townsend, president of the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington (RAMW), told AFP.In addition to the restaurant industry, immigrant labor plays a crucial role in many sectors of the economy, including agriculture and construction.Before Trump's inauguration in January, RAMW knew immigration enforcement ""was going to be a priority of the incoming administration, and so we held our first I-9 training workshop,"" said Townsend.One restaurant owner, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he felt threatened when immigration agents recently visited his establishment.""I'm going to see what the repercussions of that are. Basically, I don't know whether they're going to fine me forever or try to put me in jail,"" he said.According to a survey by employment law firm Littler Mendelson, 58 percent of executives said they were concerned Trump's anti-immigration policies would create labor shortages.The manufacturing and hospitality sectors were the most concerned.Since his restaurant was visited, the owner who requested anonymity said ""anyone who had any questions about their eligibility to work has left.""""They were advised by advocates... to basically just lay low, not come into work.""Townsend said that the ""political climate"" and economic challenges facing small businesses were likely combining to raise anxiety among restaurant workers.Increased immigration enforcement, as during Trump's first term in office, ""creates a scenario where (staff) may not return to work,"" he said.Neely said employees at Pupatella were startled by the surprise ICE visit, but that the restaurant was taking steps to address the situation.""We've made sure all of the managers know what the restaurants' rights are and what each team member's rights are,"" she said.Nevertheless, the raids do have a chilling effect.""Let's be honest, if anyone shows up at any location in a federal uniform with guns and vests... that's unnerving.""","Armed immigration agents made a surprise visit to Pupatella, a trendy pizzeria in Washington.

'Mass casualty event' declared as tornadoes hit Kentucky and Missouri





A fresh wave of deadly tornadoes swept across the central United States over the weekend, killing at least 28 people and injuring dozens more, with Kentucky and Missouri bearing the brunt of the destruction.The storms, which struck on Friday night, are part of what officials described as an unusually violent spring season.According to The New York Times, Kentucky alone reported 19 deaths, with 17 of them in Laurel County. Governor Andy Beshear confirmed that three of the 10 hospitalised victims remain in critical condition.One of those killed was Major Leslie Leatherman, a veteran firefighter who died during emergency operations. The Laurel County Fire Department called his death “a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers our first responders face every day.”The town of Kentucky’s London, was among the hardest-hit areas. Families picked through piles of wreckage and debris over the weekend. Residents like Jeff Wyatt barely escaped as their homes were torn apart. “It happened so fast… If we would have been there 10 seconds longer, we would have been gone with the family room,” Wyatt was quoted as saying by AP.Emergency management officials noted the storms were caused by a line of supercells, long-lasting, intense thunderstorms, which spun off at least 26 tornadoes across Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri.Chad Jenkins, emergency director for Brown County, Indiana, was quoted by NYT as saying, “We’ve been under almost a continuous stream of storms. It’s been a pretty turbulent spring for us.”Missouri recorded seven deaths, including five in St Louis, where Mayor Cara Spencer said about 5,000 buildings were damaged. “I would describe this as one of the worst storms in the city's history,” she said during a Saturday news conference.The storm system also caused fatalities in Virginia, where two people were killed by falling trees, and injured more than a dozen in Indiana.In Kentucky’s London, Ryan VanNorstran, who was house-sitting during the storm, described hearing screaming and feeling the house shake as windows shattered and debris flew. “I’d never really felt that kind of power from just nature,” he was quoted as saying by AP.Federal aid was approved for 24 Kentucky counties just two days before the latest disaster struck.However, as per NYT, recent staff cuts at National Weather Service offices, including a 29% vacancy rate in Louisville, have raised concerns about the country’s disaster response capabilities. Experts warn that vacancy rates above 20% can severely impact emergency preparedness.Despite the staffing shortfalls, Governor Beshear praised federal efforts in the immediate aftermath, saying on X, “Politics has no place in responding to natural disasters like this one.”The National Weather Service has warned that more dangerous weather could hit the region in the coming days, with forecasts of large hail and strong winds across the southern Great Plains, including parts of Oklahoma and Texas.Approximately 1,200 tornadoes hit the US every year, which have been reported in all 50 states over the years. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South.","Mass casualty event declared as tornadoes hit Kentucky and Missouri. At least 28 people have been killed and dozens more injured. Storms were caused by a line of supercells, long-lasting, intense thunderstorms.

Bipartisan prayers pour in for Joe Biden after aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bipartisan-prayers-pour-in-for-joe-biden-after-aggressive-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/articleshow/121257246.cms,"File photo: Former US President Joe Biden (Picture credit: AP)

BREAKING: Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer





Leaders from across the political spectrum have come together in support of former US President Joe Biden after his office announced on Sunday that he has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.The 82-year-old was diagnosed on Friday following tests that found a prostate nodule.The cancer has metastasized to the bone and carries a Gleason score of 9, indicating one of the most severe forms. However, the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which allows for “effective management,” his office said in a statement.The announcement prompted a rare moment of unity in American politics, as tributes and well-wishes flooded in from Republicans and Democrats alike.“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social.Former US Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support on X, writing, “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.”Former US President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, said via social media, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”Republican lawmakers also extended their support. “This is certainly sad news,” said house speaker Mike Johnson, adding that he and his family were praying for Biden.Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose father died of cancer in 2021, wrote, “Prayers for Joe Biden and his family.”Democratic leaders joined in with heartfelt tributes. Former house speaker Nancy Pelosi said Biden is “a great American patriot” and that she and her husband Paul were “praying for him to have strength and a swift recovery.”California Governor Gavin Newsom said, “A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life.”Senator Tim Kaine said Americans would be “with them every step of the way.”Public figures also offered personal reflections. Meghan McCain, whose father Senator John McCain died from brain cancer, wrote, “Cancer is the absolute worst... I don’t believe times like these are appropriate for politics.”Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton added, “I’m thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they’ve done so much to try to spare other families from.”Piers Morgan took aim at social media users mocking Biden’s condition, writing, “Show some bloody respect.”Former Biden spokesperson TJ Ducklo, who is also battling cancer, tweeted, “Cancer has no f***ing idea who it’s dealing with. Betting against Biden has never been and still remains a bad f***ing bet.”Several others—Senators Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, Mike Lee, Peter Welch, John Fetterman; Governors Wes Moore and JB Pritzker; and Representatives Ro Khanna, Shontel Brown, Eric Swalwell, Jasmine Crockett, Chuck Edwards and more—offered their thoughts and prayers.Biden's diagnosis comes after he experienced urinary symptoms. The cancer’s aggressive nature, Grade Group 5 with bone metastasis, means it’s “very treatable, but not curable,” news agency AP quoted Dr Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center, as saying.Biden is reportedly reviewing treatment options with his physicians.Biden’s fight against cancer has been personal. His son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. In 2022, Biden relaunched the “cancer moonshot” with the goal of halving cancer deaths over the next 25 years.","Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer.

White House slams 'rogue' judge Howell





A US federal judge on Monday barred the Donald Trump administration from moving forward with its ""dismantling"" of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP).District court judge Beryl Howell also ruled the think tank was taken over ""illegally"" by the federal government's Elon Musk-led DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) through ""blunt force,"" backed up by law enforcement officers from three separate local and federal agencies.USIP,created and funded by the United States Congress to focus on resolving violent conflicts around the globe, was taken over by DOGE in March.""The institute ultimately exercises no Executive branch power under the Constitution but operates, through research, educational teaching, and scholarship, in the sensitive area of global peace. In creating it, the Congress struck a careful balance between political accountability, on the one hand, and partisan independence and stability, on the other,"" judge Howell said, according to news agency AP.""As such, the Constitution makes clear that the president's constitutional authority only extends as far as Article II, but even Article II does not grant him (President Trump) absolute removal authority over his subordinates, under current binding caselaw precedent,"" she added.Further, Howell cited the ""uniqueness"" of the organization, saying the president ""second-guessed"" the judgment of the Congress and then-President Ronald Reagan in creating the institute 40 years ago, and the judgment of every Congress since.She declared that because the removal of the board by the administration is ""illegal,"" all subsequent actions are ""null and void.""The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed by USIP's acting president and CEO, George Moose, and former board members, had maintained the institute was established by law as an ""independent, nonprofit organization."" The plaintiffs also argued the firing of the board members did not meet any of the steps required by the law which created the organization.Earlier, their two requests for restraining orders were turned down- one each to halt the sacking of the board and to stop the administration from taking over the institute's headquarters.In an email, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said, ""the United States Institute of Peace has existed for 40 years on a $50 million annual budget, but failed to deliver peace. President Trump is right to reduce failed, useless entities like USIP to their statutory minimum and this rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not be the last say on the matter.""The federal government has 30 days to file a notice of appeal.","A US federal judge barred the Donald Trump administration from moving forward with its ""dismantling"" of the United States Institute of Peace.

"After political career shaped by cancer, Biden faces his own grim diagnosis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-political-career-shaped-by-cancer-biden-faces-his-own-grim-diagnosis/articleshow/121280896.cms,"Joe Biden (AP)





WASHINGTON: In Joe Biden's family, there's a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are ""you have cancer."" One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumour. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.Now it is the former president's turn. Biden's office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden's life could be what ends it.""Cancer touches us all,"" Biden wrote on social media. ""Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.""Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection.As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign, and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to ""channel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better"" on treating cancer to ""make sure that other people didn't have to go through what he went through.""The effort was formalised as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.""Beau should be the one running for president, not me,"" Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a ""moonshot"" initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that ""we will go to the moon"" six decades earlier.""Beating cancer is something we can do together,"" Biden said.By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau's death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.""When they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same - headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,"" he said. ""My son Beau was one of them.""Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden ""knew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren't going to miss an opportunity to address that.""McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.""He had an option to stretch it out,"" he said. ""He said no way.""The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.Learning of the diagnosis ""was a little harder than I thought,"" she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.""I'm lucky,"" she said. ""Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I'm healthy.""Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir ""Promises to Keep,"" he described ""lightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge - and then a rip of pain like I'd never felt before.""He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that ""I had no real fear of dying. I'd long since accepted the fact that life's guarantees don't include a fair shake.""McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.""He's always on to the next fight,"" he said.","Biden's office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones. One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumour. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280992,imgsize-928116,width-400,resizemode-4/121280992.jpg"
Indiana man set for execution in state's second since 2009,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indiana-man-set-for-execution-in-states-second-since-2009/articleshow/121280545.cms,"Benjamin Ritchie (AP)

Expressing regret and awaiting execution







MICHIGAN CITY: An Indiana man convicted in the 2000 killing of a police officer is set to receive a lethal injection early Tuesday in the state's second execution in 15 years. Benjamin Ritchie , 45, has been on death row for more than 20 years after being convicted in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a foot chase.Ritchie is scheduled to be executed ""before the hour of sunrise"" at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, where anti-death penalty advocates gathered late Monday. The US Supreme Court declined to review the case late Monday, exhausting Ritchie's legal options to fight the death sentence.Indiana resumed executions in December after a year-long hiatus due to a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide. Prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber before Joseph Corcoran's execution, showing a space that looks like an operating room with a gurney, fluorescent lighting, a floor drain and an adjacent viewing room. They've offered few other details about the process, including the time the executions take place.Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bars media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted one execution in the last half-century.The Associated Press and other media organizations filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana seeking media access, but a federal judge denied a preliminary injunction last week that would have allowed journalists to witness Ritchie's execution and future ones.The judge found that barring the news media doesn't violate the First Amendment nor does it single out the news media for unequal treatment.The execution in Indiana is among 12 scheduled in eight states this year. Ritchie's execution and two others in Texas and Tennessee will be carried out this week.The 2000 fatal shooting of a police officer Ritchie was 20 when he and others stole a van in Beech Grove, near Indianapolis. He then fired at Toney during a foot chase, killing him.At the time Ritchie was on probation from a 1998 burglary conviction.Toney, 31, had worked at the Beech Grove Police Department for two years. He was the first officer of the small department to be killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The community of 14,000 people mourned the married father of two as a person who showed up to help others.When Toney died, ""Everyone of us involved, including Bill, had something stolen from them that they'll never get back,"" said Deputy Police Chief Tom Hurrle, who worked with him.Relatives spoke at a clemency hearing last week, urging for the execution to move forward.""It's time. We're all tired,"" said Dee Dee Horen, who was Toney's wife. ""It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It's time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill's life, and not his death.""Appealing a death sentence Ritchie's attorneys have fought the death sentence, arguing his legal counsel at trial was ineffective because his lawyers failed to fully investigate and present evidence on his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure.Current defense attorneys say Ritchie suffered ""severe brain damage"" because his mother abused alcohol and drugs during pregnancy and he's struggled with decision-making. He was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005.""He's finally come to have some coping skills. He's a different man,"" said defense attorney Steven Schutte.Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's clemency bid last week as the parole board recommended. Braun didn't explain his decision, but board members said Ritchie's case didn't meet the bar for commuting a sentence and cited a dozen violations during Ritchie's time in prison, including threatening others with violence.The Indiana Supreme Court denied a request to stop the execution. Ritchie's attorneys challenged that decision in federal court, which a judge rejected. The 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the lower court on Sunday. Disability rights advocates say Ritchie's brain damage should exclude him from the death penalty.As the sun set Monday, the Rev. Richard Holy, a Catholic priest, recited the rosary with about 20 people in the prison parking lot and called for an end to the death penalty.Executing Ritchie ""is not going to bring Officer Toney back,"" Holy said. ""We don't have to keep taking one life to exact justice for taking another.""After the vigil, people were invited to ring a large bell displayed by a group opposed to the death penalty.Attorneys say Ritchie has changed during his more than two decades behind bars and shown remorse.In court as a young man, Ritchie smiled at Horen and laughed as the verdict was read.He told a parole board he deeply regrets his actions, especially how he acted with Toney's widow.""I wish I could go back to the day in court, because that man's wife deserved to say everything she needed to say to me, and that punk kid should have just kept his mouth shut and let her say whatever she needed to say,"" Ritchie said. ""That was her right. That was his family's right.""Ritchie has spent his last days getting visits from friends and family. Under state law, he's allowed up to five witnesses at his execution, which will include attorneys and friends.""I've ruined my life and other people's lives, and I'm so sorry for that night,"" he told the parole board earlier this month. ""You can't take back what you did.""","Benjamin Ritchie has been on death row for more than 20 years. He was convicted in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney. Ritchie is scheduled to be executed ""before the hour of sunrise"" at the Indiana State Prison.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280770,imgsize-508645,width-400,resizemode-4/121280770.jpg"

The United States Senate has confirmed real estate developer Charles Kushner , father-in-law of President Donald Trump 's daughter Ivanka, to serve as the US ambassador to France and the principality of Monaco.Kushner, who was confirmed 51-45, is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. His son Jared is a former White House senior adviser married to Ivanka, the president's eldest daughter.New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Kushner his nomination comes at a “critical time” because “our European allies are anxious.”Shaheen also asked him about his criminal past. He replied he made a “very, very, very serious mistake"" and paid a ""very heavy price for that.”In 2005, Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts, including tax evasion and witness tampering. It was the highest sentence he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the US attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie called it “one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes” he ever prosecuted as a US attorney.In 2020, the final year of his first presidency, Trump pardoned his in-law, citing the latter's ""more recent charitable work"" as the reason he deserved ""clemency.""""This record of reform and charity overshadows Mr. Kushner’s conviction and two-year sentence for preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation, and making false statements,"" the White House had said at the time.","Charles Kushner is the father-in-law of President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Kentucky cleans up

A Kansas City is spared 18 years after a tornado nearly wiped out the community



Hard-hit St. Louis waits for FEMA







LONDON: Thousands of people from Texas to Kentucky cleaned up Monday from severe weather that killed more than two dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in four days as another round of tornadoes struck the central US.At least four tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service In Wilburton, in southeast Texas, the city's Facebook page reported a tornado on the ground and heading its way. ""Take cover now!"" the post warned residents.In northern Texas, softball-sized hail was confirmed, according to Scott Kleebauer, meteorologist with the service's Weather Prediction Center.Earlier Monday in St. Louis, where officials estimated a Friday tornado damaged 5,000 buildings and may cost well over $1 billion, the mayor warned that federal assistance could take weeks.Kentucky has been hardest hit by the storms. A devastating tornado late Friday into early Saturday damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles, left many homeless, and killed at least 19 people, most of them in southeastern Laurel County.In London, Kentucky, where the devastation was centered, the small airport became a beehive of cleanup work after it took a direct hit from a tornado. Small aircraft stored there had large dents in them and even wings ripped open. Officials were using it as a base to get water, food, diapers and other supplies out to the community.""We have 1,001 things going on. But we're managing it. And we're going to get it all cleaned up,"" said London Mayor Randall Weddle.Officials in Kansas and Texas also were evaluating damage from late Sunday storms.The risk of severe storms moves into Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee on Tuesday, the weather service said.The Kentucky storms that killed 19 people were part of a weather system that caused seven deaths in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said.Lonnie Nantz hid in a hallway with his wife, two daughters and a grandson as the one-story brick home they bought near London in 1977 was destroyed around them. They were trapped in rubble for about 20 minutes in the midnight darkness before they were rescued unharmed.""I don't know why this happened. I've tried to live a good life all my life. I've still got the faith,"" said the 77-year-old Nantz, who went to church as always on Sunday.London city worker Ashley Taylor was back on the job Monday loading doughnuts to take to a hospital and dispatch center even though there was a tarp on her roof. She was lucky - the houses across her street were destroyed late Friday night.She survived the storm with nine other people and three dogs in the crawl space of a neighbor's home.""We prayed like never before - and just thankful for everything God did for us,"" Taylor said.In surrounding Laurel County, first responders mourned one of their own.Fellow firefighters found the body of Laurel County Fire Major Leslie Leatherman on top of a woman he was shielding from the storm's fury as he answered calls during the worst of the storm. The woman was yelling for help and they were in a field across from a destroyed subdivision.The injured woman turned out to be Leatherman's wife and officials aren't sure if he knew who he was protecting in the darkness and chaos, the fire department said on social media.Forecasters on Sunday night issued a tornado emergency for Greensburg, Kansas, where 12 people were killed and 90% of the town was destroyed in May 2007 by a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) wide tornado with winds of 205 mph (330 kph).The city was spared this time. Power was out but residents were safe after the ""storm scare,"" Greensburg officials posted on social media.Tornadoes in Kansas carved a 20-mile (32-kilometer) path through Stafford and Reno counties. While damage was extensive, no injuries or deaths were reported.St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected by an EF3 tornado with winds up to 150 mph (240 kph) that slammed areas north and west of downtown Friday. Spencer has estimated that damages will exceed $1.6 billion.""Eight miles of pure destruction, at times a mile wide,"" Spencer said at a Monday news conference. ""We're talking about thousands of buildings, thousands of families are being displaced.""The city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the governor's office as a first step to getting federal assistance.US Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm. ""I'm not happy about the fact we're still waiting from all of that damage two months ago,"" Hawley said.Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Chief David Richardson said last week he plans to shift responsibility for disaster recovery to states this year as part of an agencywide transformation and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance ""when deemed necessary.""Spencer said during a news conference Monday evening that emergency protocols put in place in 2021 were not followed, possibly preventing sirens being activated to warn residents about the tornado.She said it was not clear whose responsibility it was to let the community know about the emergency but that the fire department will do so moving forward.In Texas, several tornadoes touched down west of Fort Worth on Sunday, including an EF1 with peak winds of 105 mph (169 kph) that caused damage in and around Gordon, the weather service said Monday.","At least four tornadoes confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening.
