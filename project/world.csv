On Saturday, during a farmers' gathering, he was brought on a stretcher to address the crowd while lying in a bed on stage. His speech emphasised that farmers' welfare was more important than his own life.Following the event, Dallewal experienced severe dizziness and vomiting, according to Dr Avtar Singh of the NGO 5 Rivers Heart Association, who is monitoring his condition.“His blood pressure fluctuated significantly during the event. He felt dizzy and vomited when he was being taken back to his tent,” Dr Singh told news agency PTI.

Musk's comments have drawn sharp reactions, with health secretary Wes Streeting calling Musk’s criticism “misjudged and certainly misinformed.”Musk also criticised Starmer’s government for its alleged complicity, and he called for new elections despite the Labour Party’s landslide victory in July 2024. Critics, including pollster Luke Tryl, have argued that Musk, who is increasingly involved in British politics, ""has no handle on UK politics.""Musk’s remarks went beyond the grooming cases. He also attacked Jess Phillips, the minister for the prevention of violence against women and girls, suggesting that she “deserves to be in prison” for opposing a national inquiry into the Oldham scandal.Musk continued to support controversial far-right figure Tommy Robinson , who is currently serving a prison sentence for contempt of court. He described Robinson as being jailed ""for telling the truth"" and demanded his release, posting “Free Robinson” on X.Musk’s involvement in UK politics took a new turn when he criticised Reform UK leader Nigel Farage on X, urging him to step down.

Wafiq Safa , a key figure in the organisation, disclosed on Sunday that Nasrallah was inside the underground operations room in Beirut’s southern suburbs when the strikes occurred on September 27.Israeli airstrikes that day destroyed multiple buildings in the area, killing Nasrallah and five others, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The attack marked a critical turning point, escalating months of low-level conflict into a full-scale war that ravaged parts of Lebanon until a fragile US-brokered ceasefire was reached on November 27.“He led the battle and the war from this very location,” Safa stated during a press conference near the site of the strike.Israel initially declared Nasrallah’s death via a military spokesperson, who hailed the airstrike as ending decades of what it described as terrorism orchestrated by the Hezbollah leader. Nasrallah, who led the organisation for 32 years, had shaped it into a formidable political and militant entity, deeply entrenched in Lebanon’s politics and a central adversary of Israel.The ceasefire agreement reached after the conflict mandates Hezbollah’s withdrawal north of the Litani River and the dismantling of its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.However, tensions remain high. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz accused Hezbollah of failing to meet the terms of the agreement, warning of potential military action if compliance is not ensured. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem countered with threats of renewed strikes should Israeli forces fail to withdraw fully from southern Lebanon by the end of January.The ceasefire remains precarious, with both sides trading accusations of violations. The United Nations peacekeeping force has been tasked with monitoring the situation, but sporadic skirmishes and overflights suggest the underlying conflict is far from resolved.","Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year.

Who is Inah Canabarro?

'I’m young, pretty'

Inah Canabarro , a Brazilian nun, has become the world’s oldest living person at almost 117 years old. LongeviQuest, a group tracking supercentenarians, declared her the oldest person with validated records on Saturday. Tomiko Itooka of Japan, the previous oldest person, died in December.Inah Canabarro was born on June 8, 1908, in southern Brazil, according to LongeviQuest. However, her nephew, Cleber Canabarro , 84, says she was actually born on May 27 but was registered two weeks later. She currently lives in a retirement home in Porto Alegre, Brazil.Canabarro’s great-grandfather was a Brazilian general who had taken up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil’s independence from Portugal in the 19th century.Cleber Canabarro said Inah was frail as a child, and many did not think she would survive her childhood.Inah Canabarro became a nun as a teenager, working in Uruguay and Rio de Janeiro before returning to Rio Grande do Sul. She taught General João Figueiredo, Brazil’s last military dictator, and started two marching bands.“I’m young, pretty and friendly – all very good, positive qualities that you have too,” Canabarro said in a video recorded by LongeviQuest in February. She attributes her long life to her Catholic faith. The video shows her telling jokes, displaying miniature paintings of wildflowers, and reciting the Hail Mary.Her nephew visits her every Saturday and sends voice messages between visits to lift her spirits after two hospitalizations left her weak and struggling to talk.“The other sisters say she gets a jolt when she hears my voice,” Cleber says. “She gets excited.”Canabarro is a fan of the local soccer club, Inter. “White or black, rich or poor, whoever you are, Inter is the team of the people,” she said in a video celebrating her 116th birthday.Inah Canabarro is the second-oldest nun ever recorded. Pope Francis also honored her for her 110th birthday. She now ranks as the 20th oldest documented person ever. Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at age 122, topped the list.","Inah Canabarro, a Brazilian nun, has become the world’s oldest living person at almost 117 years old.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party this week, the Globe and Mail reported, citing information from three people it didn’t name.Trudeau has been under pressure from elected lawmakers in his party to quit for months — and it increased further when Chrystia Freeland , his finance minister, stepped down on December 16, saying she and the prime minister were at odds on policy.Liberal lawmakers are scheduled to hold a caucus meeting on Wednesday. Trudeau’s resignation would trigger a race for the party leadership, with the winner becoming prime minister.After the split with Freeland, some of Trudeau’s closest advisers held the view that the prime minister couldn’t survive the political fallout, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.More than 20 Liberal members of parliament have publicly called for Trudeau’s departure, and more have said in private meetings that the prime minister has no choice but to leave. The Liberals have 153 seats in the House of Commons, including Trudeau’s.The Canadian currency strengthened as much as 0.4 per cent to C$1.4388 per dollar after the reports, advancing for the first time in five sessions. The currency is trading near its weakest level since March 2020 and has lost more than 7 per cent against the greenback in the past year.The prime minister has largely disappeared from public view since Freeland posted her stinging resignation letter. Trudeau spent much of the holidays at a ski resort in western Canada and hasn’t spoken with reporters since returning to Ottawa.The Globe story didn’t say that Trudeau has firmly made up his mind to resign.A new survey by Nanos Research, taken in late December, has the Conservative Party extending a huge lead going into an election year.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party this week, the Globe and Mail reported.

""But my wheelchair was completely bashed and the pieces were all over the place, so something hit me.""His daughter, Heaven Sensky Kirsch, confirmed to the Daily Mail that the damaged wheelchair found at the scene belonged to her father.Sensky described the chaotic scene as he lay on the ground. ""I just heard screaming and I heard gunfire,"" he said. ""No one would come, and so I pushed myself on my back... I was screaming out for help, and people were just looking at me."" He added, ""I kept asking for someone to help me and get me out of there, and it took a while. I realised that it was a bad scene.""His family grew worried when they couldn’t reach him. After seeing the news, they rushed to the hospital. Kirsch explained that Sensky had several injuries, including a black eye, road rash, and broken legs. “He was hit by the truck and thrown from his wheelchair... one of his legs had a bone sticking out that he watched them saw off,” she said.Kirsch finds comfort in the thought that her father’s heavy wheelchair may have slowed the truck’s momentum, possibly saving other lives. “I am telling myself that my dad’s heavy wheelchair slowed down that heavy truck for a lot of people,” she said.The family has set up a GoFundMe to cover medical expenses, and Sensky was gifted a new wheelchair by the United Cajun Navy . His daughter says her father’s positive attitude and love for life are keeping the family strong. “He is so lucky to be alive,” she said. “My dad is a fighter and loves to live life.”","Jeremi Sensky, 51, has been paralyzed since a car accident in 1999.

New Year’S Attack New Orleans: Did New Orleans attacker Shamsud-Din Jabbar use Meta glasses to plan his rampage?

The man behind the deadly New Year’s attack in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar , had planned the assault for weeks, using Meta smart glasses to record videos of the city in the lead-up to the attack, the FBI revealed in a press conference on Sunday.Jabbar, 42, visited New Orleans twice in the months before the attack, first in October and again in November. During his visits, he used the smart glasses to film a bicycle tour of the French Quarter, seemingly planning his assault, the New York Post reports.FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil explained that the glasses allow users to record videos and photos hands-free, with livestreaming options. However, they were not activated during the New Year’s Day attack. ""They were not actively recording during the attack,"" Myrthil confirmed.On January 1, Jabbar drove a rented Ford F-150 Lightning truck through a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring 35 others.The FBI also discovered new security footage showing Jabbar placing two homemade bombs on the street before carrying out the attack. The glasses and a brown coat found inside the truck were seen in the video footage.The FBI also confirmed Jabbar's involvement with ISIS, revealing that he had posted videos online claiming to have “joined ISIS earlier this year.” While he acted alone in the attack, investigators are continuing to probe Jabbar’s associates both in the US and abroad.In addition to the explosives, two firearms— a semiautomatic pistol and a rifle— were recovered, with the rifle purchased in a private sale in Arlington, Texas, on November 19. The FBI believes Jabbar also set fire to a short-term rental home in New Orleans, where bomb-making materials were discovered.Although Jabbar’s attack was devastating and took many lives, neither of the homemade bombs he placed in the area detonated.","Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, had planned the assault for weeks, using Meta smart glasses to record videos of the city in the lead-up to the attack.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

South Korean protesters demand President Yoon’s ouster as detention deadline approaches,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/south-korean-protesters-demand-president-yoons-ouster-as-detention-deadline-approaches/articleshow/116958677.cms,"Hundreds of South Koreans are protesting near the residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, demanding his ouster and arrest as authorities prepare to renew efforts to detain him.Protesters rallied overnight into Sunday, calling for Yoon’s removal after a failed detention attempt on Friday. The one-week warrant for Yoon’s detention, which expires on Monday, has led to heightened tensions as authorities plan to execute the warrant amid security challenges.Dozens of anti-corruption investigators and police attempted to execute the detention warrant against Yoon on Friday but were met with resistance from presidential security forces in a tense five-hour standoff. Yoon, who has refused to appear for questioning and obstructed searches, faces charges of rebellion following his December 3 martial law decree. The decree sent troops to surround the National Assembly, but the declaration was overturned, and Yoon was impeached on December 14 for rebellion.The Corruption Investigation for High-Ranking Officials, leading the probe, says detaining Yoon is ""virtually impossible"" due to his protection by the presidential security service. The agency has urged Acting Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to ensure the presidential service complies with the execution of the detention warrant, but Choi has not yet commented publicly.The protest on Sunday highlighted ongoing frustration with Yoon’s defiance of the legal process. Anti-Yoon demonstrators, separated by police barricades, voiced their anger over the failed attempt to detain the president. Pro-Yoon protesters also gathered nearby, defending him against the impeachment and demanding his reinstatement.Yoon's lawyers have challenged the legality of the detention and search warrants, arguing that they cannot be enforced at his residence due to military protection laws. They also contend that the anti-corruption office lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges, and police cannot assist in Yoon’s detention.The presidential security service’s attempt to block the detainment could amount to obstruction of duty, as the service’s mandate does not extend to blocking court orders. While the president enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, allegations of rebellion or treason are exceptions.Tensions have escalated as investigators and police faced scuffles with presidential security, which prevented them from getting closer than 200 meters from Yoon’s residence. The Defense Ministry has expressed concern over the deployment of military personnel to block the detention warrant, deeming it ""inappropriate.""Yoon’s powers have been suspended since the National Assembly's impeachment vote on December 14, and his fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether to uphold the impeachment or reinstate him.","Protesters rallied overnight into Sunday, calling for Yoon’s removal after a failed detention attempt on Friday.

"Singapore sees increase in 'sham marriages' with foreign women, sparks concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/singapore-sees-increase-in-sham-marriages-with-foreign-women-sparks-concern/articleshow/116956793.cms,"NEW DELHI: Singapore authorities have raised concerns over a sharp increase in ""sham marriages"" or "" marriages of convenience "", predominantly between Singaporean men and foreign women, often facilitated by syndicates, according to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).The ICA reported 32 cases of sham marriages between January and September 2024, a stark rise compared to just four during the same period in 2023. These arrangements typically involve foreign women paying Singaporean men to marry them, enabling the women to secure permits to stay or work in the country, The Straits Times reported.Inspector Mark Chai, deputy officer-in-charge of ICA's intelligence division, warned that such marriages pose social risks in Singapore's multi-ethnic society. ""The idea of such marriages is often spread through word of mouth. And to some Singaporean men, it can be seen as easy money,"" he said.However, he stressed that these arrangements are illegal and said, ""ICA is stepping up enforcement efforts to bust such arrangements.""According to The Straits Times report, One recent case involved a 33-year-old Singaporean man living in a flat in Bukit Batok, who had been married to a Vietnamese woman for several years, according to marriage documents. However, ICA officers received a tip-off that it was a sham marriage.ICA officers on December 11 raided the flat and found no evidence of a married couple living there. There were no women’s clothes, and the man’s mother told officers she was unaware of her son’s marriage.When questioned, the man claimed his wife lived with him and said her clothes were stored elsewhere. He was subsequently arrested for allegedly making false declarations in applications for immigration facilities.Superintendent Goh Wee Kiat, senior assistant director at ICA's intelligence division, highlighted that public tip-offs often help uncover such cases. He noted that there are telltale signs of sham marriages, such as family members being unaware of the union or spouses living separately.In one instance, a Singaporean man falsely claimed his ""wife"" lived with him, but investigations revealed her belongings were stored elsewhere. ""The couple can try to hide the fact that their union is a marriage of convenience, but there are telltale signs that our officers are able to spot,"" Goh said.Convictions for participating in sham marriages can result in up to 10 years in prison, fines of up to SGD 10,000, or both. In June 2024, 13 individuals – seven Singaporean men and six Vietnamese women – were charged for their alleged involvement in such arrangements.Authorities have urged the public to report suspected cases, assuring that all information provided will be treated with strict confidentiality.","Singapore authorities have raised concerns over a sharp increase in ""sham marriages"" or "" marriages of convenience"" These are predominantly between Singaporean men and foreign women, often facilitated by syndicates. 32 cases of sham marriages between January and September 2024, a stark rise compared to just four during the same period in 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116957155,imgsize-1948511,width-400,resizemode-4/116957155.jpg"
