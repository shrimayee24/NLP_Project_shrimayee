Father of accused claims false arrest



Congress leader joins 'not the same person' chorus

Cops yet to do facial analysis test

NEW DELHI: The simple case of 'burglary gone wrong' at actor Saif Ali Khan 's residence in which he was injured continues to raise questions with the arrest of a Bangladeshi national and medical report from the hospital.The actor, who was discharged three days ago after undergoing surgery at Lilavati Hospital, gave his statement to the police. Meanwhile, opposition leaders in Maharashtra have jumped in, raising questions regarding the attack and the arrest. The father of the accused has also termed it a ""false"" arrest.On Thursday, Bandra police took Saif's statement regarding the violent encounter with an intruder at his 11th-floor residence in Satguru Sharan. The actor said, ""My grip loosened after the stranger stabbed me repeatedly on my back with a knife after I overpowered him.""According to Saif, his household members and staff were terrified when they spotted the armed trespasser. He immediately moved to confront the intruder to safeguard his younger son Jehangir and the staff. In his statement, Saif mentioned that he and Kareena were in their bedroom, and Taimur was in another room with a nurse. Their younger son Jehangir was in a different bedroom with staff nurse Eliyamma Phillip and a domestic helper when Phillip spotted the intruder.A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16. The actor suffered five distinct wounds on his back, wrist, neck, shoulder, and elbow.The report highlighted:The question raised on the day of the attack remains a mystery as different versions come up. Initially, it was reported that there were no drivers available at that hour at Saif's residence and no car was ready. He was taken to the hospital by his younger son Ibrahim in an auto.The auto driver who transported Saif to Lilavati Hospital, approximately 2 km from the actor's residence at Satguru Sharan building in Bandra, mentioned that the actor was with a ""small child"", presumably his seven-year-old son Taimur, along with another individual.The driver, who works night shifts in the Bandra-Khar area, said he spotted one of the actor's domestic help waving at him near Satguru Sharan. ""It was a scene of panic. The actor sat inside, his son in the middle and (Hari) on the side before we left for the hospital,"" he recalled, describing how a blood-soaked Khan struggled to walk. Upon reaching the hospital, the staff immediately attended to him and took him on a stretcher.The neurosurgeon who operated on Saif also said that the actor arrived at the hospital in an auto with his seven-year-old son, Taimur Ali Khan , and a caretaker. ""I was the first one to meet Saif Ali Khan when he came to the hospital. He was drenched in blood, but he walked in like a lion with his small child, Taimur. Saif Ali Khan is a real hero,"" the doctor had said.However, the medical report sent to Bandra Police indicated that Saif was probably taken to the hospital by Afsar Zaidi, his manager and close associate who operates a celebrity management firm.According to the report, Zaidi accompanied Saif to the hospital on January 16 with the admission process completed at 4.11 am.The medical documentation from Lilavati Hospital submitted to the police listed Zaidi's name in the section designated for friends.The medical form has also led to many questioning an alleged 'delay' in Saif reaching the hospital. According to the medical report, the time of the attack was 2.30 am. The actor was, however, admitted to the hospital at 4.11 am.Saif Ali Khan 's home is just 2.3 km (10-15 minutes) away from the hospital.Md Ruhul Amin, father of accused Shariful Islam Sajjad , asserted his son's innocence and appealed to Indian authorities for his immediate release and claimed the photo in the CCTV released by police did not match his son.Shariful Islam hails from Rajabaria village in Jhalakathi, a southern Bangladeshi district located over 200 km away from Dhaka.""I have come to know through various YouTube channels and journalists via telephone that my 30-year-old son Shariful Islam Sajjad has been arrested in India for assaulting actor Saif Ali Khan,"" Md Ruhul Amin told ANI.""My son was arrested on suspicion because of his resemblance to the person involved in the attacks. My son is innocent,"" he added.Md Ruhul Amin expressed his intention to seek assistance from the Bangladesh government through diplomatic channels.""I will go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh after 3 or 4 days and request the Bangladesh government to take diplomatic initiative to free my son,"" he said.A day after Maharashtra cabinet minister and BJP leader Nitesh Rane stirred controversy as he questioned if Saif was assaulted or if the attack was staged, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said the arrested person and the one in the CCTV footage were not the same.""The attack on Saif Ali Khan, it has been stated that the person shown in the CCTV footage and the person who has been arrested are different. I have also seen the photos and they are not the same. The police need to clarify this immediately,"" he said.The police said forensic analysis confirmed that Fakir was linked to the crime. Fingerprints found at multiple locations inside the actor’s flat match those of Fakir.The police, however, while seeking an extension of his custody, told the court that it is yet to conduct a facial recognition test to ascertain if he was the same as the person seen on CCTV footage.The police also need to match the suspect’s footprints to those found at the crime scene and recover the shoes Fakir wore during the attack and the missing portion of the knife used.","A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16.

Republican support and optimism

Democratic dissent

The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as the new secretary of defense late Friday night after a nail-biting vote, solidifying his place at the helm of the Pentagon. The vote split 50-50 along mostly partisan lines, with US Vice President JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote in favour of the controversial nominee.US President Donald Trump quickly celebrated the confirmation, praising Hegseth on Truth Social, ""Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense!""Hegseth, a 44-year-old retired Army major and former Fox News host, has been one of Trump's most polarising cabinet appointees, drawing both fierce criticism and staunch support. While Republicans hailed his military experience and commitment to strengthening the armed forces, Democrats raised serious concerns about his qualifications, past conduct, and controversial remarks.Three Republican senators—Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky)—joined all 47 Democrats in opposing Hegseth's nomination. Vice President Vance, stepping in to cast the deciding vote, joked on social media afterwards, ""I thought I was done voting in the Senate.""Hegseth's critics highlighted a series of allegations against him, including sexual assault, financial mismanagement, and excessive drinking. They also cited his controversial statements about women serving in the military, including a declaration after the November election that women should not serve in combat roles.Despite these controversies, the majority of Republicans rallied behind Hegseth, emphasising his military credentials and alignment with Trump's vision for a stronger and more aggressive US defense policy.Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) lauded Hegseth's confirmation, calling him ""bullish on creating a larger, more lethal military"" and ""clear-eyed about America's enemies, including Iran."" Graham also noted Hegseth's strong support for Israel, saying, ""Israel will have no better friend than Pete Hegseth.""Other Republicans echoed Graham's optimism. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) described Hegseth as ""the change agent that the DOD desperately needs,"" while Senator Katie Britt (R-Alabama) expressed confidence in his ability to ""restore peace through strength.""Republican Whip John Thune (R-SD) celebrated the moment, posting photos of him embracing Hegseth on social media with an American flag emoji and the message, ""Congrats Mr secretary.""Prominent conservative figures, including Donald Trump Jr and Megyn Kelly, also voiced their support, framing Hegseth's confirmation as a victory for America's armed forces.Democrats, however, were unanimous in their opposition, with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) calling Hegseth ""erratic and unqualified."" Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) warned that his confirmation ""will make our nation less safe,"" while Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) criticised Hegseth’s history of defending war criminals and advocating for privatising the VA.Even some Republicans, including McConnell, expressed serious reservations. In a detailed statement, McConnell criticised Hegseth's lack of a strategic vision for countering major threats like China and his inability to articulate plans for defending US allies in Asia. ""The consequences of failure in this role are higher than ever,"" McConnell said, though he ultimately wished Hegseth ""great success.""","The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as the new secretary of defense late Friday night after a nail-biting vote.

Michelle Obama’s absence fuels speculation

No official word yet

A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm, fueled by discussions of a possible separation and an alleged connection between Barack Obama and actress Jennifer Aniston . Amid this, Megyn Kelly, the host of The Megyn Kelly Show , addressed the rumours and said ""it would be a political earthquake"" if it were true.Kelly's social media posts on X and Instagram rapidly spread, drawing attention to the potential consequences of such a separation. ""I don't know whether it is true,"" she said, ""but if it is, it truly would be a political earthquake in Democratic circles, never mind America.""In her video, Kelly further emphasised the rarity of presidential divorces, saying ''I don't remember a presidential divorce in modern history.''A post on X has added fuel to the fire, claiming that Jennifer Aniston is romantically involved with Barack Obama. The post alleged that a friend of Aniston revealed the relationship during a casual conversation at a gathering. ""He's with Jennifer Aniston. My old manager, now a friend, is connected to her inner circle. At a gathering with Jennifer's friends, the affair came up casually -- Jennifer herself admitted it. They were sitting with a psychic, which makes it sound surreal, but it's definitely not a secret among her closest friends,"" the message read.The message has since gone viral, sparking heated debates and widespread speculation. Social media users were quick to point out that the rumours align with earlier tabloid claims, despite Aniston's public denial during an October appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Laughing off a magazine cover story suggesting a romance with Barack Obama, Aniston called the claims ""absolutely untrue"" but joked that she wasn't offended by them.The rumours of a split gained traction when Michelle Obama was noticeably absent from key events, including the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.Michelle’s team later clarified that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii during the Carter funeral. However, reports suggesting that she has distanced herself from Washington, life and spends little time with Barack have added to the speculation.As the rumours continue to swirl, neither Barack nor Michelle Obama has commented publicly on the matter.

Donald Trump Jr has a stark warning for any Republican who votes against Tulsi Gabbard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-jr-has-a-stark-warning-for-any-republican-who-votes-against-tulsi-gabbard/articleshow/117525757.cms,"2020 Democratic Debate - SNL

Why Gabbard has an uphill battle



Donald Trump Jr. issued a stark warning to Republican senators ahead of the confirmation hearing for Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI). In a tweet, Trump Jr wrote, “Any Republican Senator who votes against @TulsiGabbard deserves a primary. No more Deep State b******!!!!”The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing on January 30 to assess Gabbard’s qualifications. The hearing follows delays from Senate Democrats, who cited incomplete background checks, ethics disclosures, and other paperwork on the controversial nominee.If confirmed, Gabbard—a former Democrat congresswoman—would oversee all 18 US intelligence agencies. However, her nomination has sparked sharp debate in Washington. Critics point to her lack of intelligence experience and her controversial relationships with US adversaries.Gabbard faced scrutiny for meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2017, shortly after allegations emerged that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. She has also been a vocal defender of whistleblower Edward Snowden and has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine.Despite these concerns, Gabbard has sought to build bipartisan support, notably reversing her stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Once critical of the program, Gabbard now supports its use to allow US intelligence agencies to monitor foreign nationals abroad without a warrant.“If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people,” Gabbard said in a statement earlier this month.Her shift on Section 702 has garnered support from prominent Republican lawmakers, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).The upcoming hearing is expected to be contentious, as senators from both parties weigh Gabbard's qualifications and past actions against her recent pledges to support national security initiatives.Tulsi Gabbard's lack of formal intelligence experience is a major concern for her nomination as Director of National Intelligence (DNI), given the critical oversight role of managing the US's 18 intelligence agencies. While her military and congressional background is notable, critics argue it may not sufficiently prepare her for the complexities of the intelligence domain.Her foreign policy stances have drawn bipartisan criticism. Gabbard's 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, known for human rights abuses, and her controversial comments on US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, perceived as echoing Russian propaganda, have raised serious questions about her judgment.Gabbard’s perceived sympathies toward adversarial nations, including Russia and Syria, have further fueled skepticism about her ability to provide unbiased intelligence assessments. These perceptions stem from her public statements and diplomatic interactions that some view as overly conciliatory.Read: The obscure cult that could ruin Tulsi Gabbard's chances The most contentious issue is her association with the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF), a religious organization described by critics as cult-like. Allegations that SIF leader Chris Butler exerted influence over her political career raise concerns about potential undue external influence in her decision-making.Her shifting political allegiances, including her departure from the Democratic Party and endorsement of Donald Trump, have raised eyebrows. This evolution in her political stance has alienated members of both parties, complicating her confirmation prospects.Ethical and financial concerns have also emerged. Delays in her confirmation hearings are attributed to incomplete ethics paperwork, and scrutiny of her financial disclosures, including media earnings and book deals, has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest.Bipartisan opposition presents a significant hurdle for Gabbard’s nomination. Senators from both sides, including Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Tammy Duckworth, have voiced reservations, reflecting widespread unease about her suitability for the DNI role.Public and intelligence community skepticism adds to the challenges. Figures like John Bolton have openly criticised her nomination, citing her controversial past and perceived vulnerabilities, which many argue make her unfit to manage the nation’s intelligence operations.","Tulsi Gabbard's nomination for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has sparked sharp debate in Washington.

Barack Obama Divorce: Jason Whitlock says Barack Obama and Michelle have no reason to stay married after Biden did this,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jason-whitlock-says-barack-obama-and-michelle-have-no-reason-to-stay-married-after-biden-did-this/articleshow/117555826.cms,"Jason Whitlock made an explosive claim about Barack Obama and Michelle Obama's marriage.

Did Jennifer Aniston really admit dating Barack Obama?



Sports media personal Jason Whitlock commented on the rumors of former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle getting divorced and said he always considered this marriage a political one. ""Barack Obama needed a Black wife to be the president and there were people who wanted him to be the president. So he had a very political marriage with Michelle Obama. And once Joe Biden made it impossible for Michelle Obama to run for president this year, as many people thought they were positioning Michelle Obama to replace Joe Biden, there's actually no reason for these two people to stay married to each other,"" Whitlock said in his podcast.Whitlock said he believes that Barack Obama at his core, if one puts the politics part aside, was headed to be married to a woman like Jennifer Aiston and that's what he's doing now as he's free now. ""It's like 'well I am free now and I can do whatever I really want to do, marry some white girl like Jennifer Aniston and take trips and read books on beaches..."" Whitlock said.The rumors of an impending divorce started doing the rounds as Barack Obama made sole appearances at two crucial political events -- the funeral of Jimmy Carter and the inauguration of Donald Trump. Both were read as a political snub to Trump from Michelle but at the same time speculations are rife that Barack and Michelle are not together anymore and Barack Obama is dating Jennifer Aniston.Several prominent people like Megyn Kelly, Meghan McCain said they heard these rumors from highly placed sources. Meanwhile, a social media DM purportedly written by someone in Aniston's circle went viral as it claimed that everyone in Jen's friends' circle knows about it as Aniston herself admitted it.The viral post has been attributed to an acquaintance of Jennifer Aniston and it has not been dismissed by anyone. In October last year, Aniston was asked about the rumors as there was a cover story on her and Barack Obama dating. She said she was not mad about the story but there was no truth in it. At that time, she added that she met Barack Obama only once and knew Michelle better than Barack.","Sports media personal Jason Whitlock commented on the rumors of former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle getting divorced.

The United States has frozen all the foreign aids for several countries, including Ukraine on Friday but Israel and Turkey are exempted.An internal directive from secretary of state Marco Rubio, issued shortly after President Donald Trump 's inauguration, emphasised an ""America First"" approach to overseas assistance, AFP reported.""No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved,"" stated the internal memo obtained by AFP.According to the memo, the exceptions were only meant for emergency food, and military funding for Israel and Egypt.This comprehensive directive impacts various aid categories, including development and military support, notably affecting Ukraine, which had received substantial weapons funding under the previous Biden administration during its defence against Russian forces.The suspension also halts US funding for PEPFAR, the HIV/AIDS programme providing anti-retroviral treatments in developing nations, particularly across Africa.PEPFAR, established during George W Bush's presidency in 2003, has preserved approximately 26 million lives and previously maintained broad bipartisan backing in Washington.The directive specifically excludes military aid to Israel, whose US arms support has increased since the Gaza conflict, and Egypt, a recipient of substantial US defence funding since its 1979 peace agreement with Israel.Rubio included provisions for US emergency food aid contributions, which have supported crisis-affected regions including Sudan and Syria.Democratic legislators highlighted that PEPFAR supports over 20 million individuals requiring medication, whilst US-funded anti-malaria initiatives assist 63 million people.","The United States has frozen all the foreign aids for several countries, including Ukraine on Friday.

Donald Trump calls on Jordan and Egypt to accept Palestinian refugees to 'clean-out' Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-calls-on-arab-nations-egypt-jordan-to-accept-palestinian-refugees-to-clean-out-gaza/articleshow/117569538.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled from Las Vegas to Miami (AP photo)

US President Trump pushed for increased acceptance of Palestinian refugees from Gaza by Arab nations, including Jordan and Egypt, so that they can ""clean out"" war-torn area of Gaza.During a 20-minute question-and-answer session on Saturday with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump revealed that he discussed this vision with King Abdullah II of Jordan earlier in the day and plans to speak with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday. ""I'd like him to take people. I'd like Egypt to take people,"" said Trump. ""You're talking about, probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know it's, over'.""Trump mentioned that he complimented Jordan for successfully accepting Palestinian refugees and told the king, ""I'd love for you to take on more, cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess.""He added that such a mass movement of Palestinians ""could be temporary or long term,"" noting that the area encompassing Gaza has experienced ""many, many conflicts"" over centuries.""Something has to happen,"" Trump said. ""But it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there."" He expressed his preference to involve Arab nations in building housing for Palestinians in a different location, where they could ""maybe live in peace for a change.""Ever since his White House return on Monday, Trump has been politically active in making decisions with regards to the Israel-Gaza war. On Day 1, Trump immediately issued multiple executive orders and expressed his opinions on various matters, including the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. ""The hostages are starting to come back. Oh, if I. If I weren't here, they wouldn't be back ever. They would have never come back. They would have all died. If this were done a year earlier, if Biden would have done this deal a year and a half, two years ago, or frankly, it should have never happened,"" he said.Trump also cancelled an executive directive previously established by Joe Biden , which had permitted sanctions against violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Biden's February 2024 order had enabled the identification of several settlers and organisations accused of perpetrating violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territory, under occupation since 1967.Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Trump lifted the restriction on delivering 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, which was previously imposed to minimise civilian casualties during Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza, currently under a fragile ceasefire.Then-President Biden had initially suspended the delivery of these heavy bombs in May, aiming to prevent Israel from conducting a full-scale military operation in Rafah, a southern Gaza city. However, Israel did gain control of Rafah a month later, after most of its one million residents and displaced persons had evacuated the area.The earlier suspension by Biden had also affected a shipment of 1,700 500-pound bombs destined for Israel. However, these smaller munitions were eventually delivered several weeks after the initial hold.","US President Trump pushed for increased acceptance of Palestinian refugees from Gaza by Arab nations, including Jordan and Egypt.

The moves suggested North Korea will likely maintain its run of weapons tests and its confrontational stance against the U.S. for now, even though President Donald Trump said he intends to reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un The official Korean Central News Agency said Kim observed the test of sea-to-surface strategic cruise guided weapons on Saturday.The term ""strategic"" implies the missiles are nuclear-capable. KCNA said the missiles hit their targets after travelling 1,500-kilometer (932-mile) -long elliptical and figure-eight-shaped flight patterns, but that couldn't be independently verified.KCNA cited Kim as saying that North Korea's war deterrence capabilities ""are being perfected more thoroughly"" and affirming that his country will make ""strenuous efforts"" to defend stability ""on the basis of more powerfully developed military muscle.""In a separate statement carried by KCNA on Sunday, North Korea's Foreign Ministry criticized the US for committing ""serious military provocations aiming at"" North Korea with a series of military exercises with South Korea this month.""The reality stresses that the DPRK should counter the U.S. with the toughest counteraction from A to Z as long as it refuses the sovereignty and security interests of the DPRK and this is the best option for dealing with the U.S,"" the Foreign Ministry statement said.DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the abbreviation of its formal name. The Foreign Ministry warning was in line with Kim's vows to implement the ""toughest"" anti-US policy during a year-end political meeting.North Korea views US military training with South Korea as invasion rehearsals though Washington and Seoul have repeatedly said their drills are defensive in nature. In recent years, the US and South Korea have expanded their military exercises in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear program.The start of Trump's second term raises prospects for the revival of diplomacy between the US and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term. The Trump-Kim diplomacy in 2018-19 fell apart due to wrangling over US-led economic sanctions on North Korea.During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim ""a smart guy"" and ""not a religious zealot."" Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, ""I will, yeah.""On Monday, Trump called North Korea ""a nuclear power"" as he spoke of his personal ties with Kim during a news conference at the Oval Office after his inauguration. Washington, Seoul and their partners have long shunned describing North Korea as a nuclear state because that could be seen as accepting its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.Many experts say Kim likely thinks he has greater bargaining power than in his earlier round of diplomacy with Trump because of his country's enlarged nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.In South Korea, many worry that Trump might scale back military drills with the Asian US ally and abandon the goal of the complete denuclearization of North Korea and focus on eliminating its long-range missile program, which poses a direct threat to the US, while leaving its nuclear attack capabilities against South Korea intact.After his first summit with Kim in 2018, Trump baffled many in South Korea by unilaterally announcing the suspension of major summertime military drills, calling them ""very provocative"" and ""tremendously expensive.""North Korea hasn't commented on Trump's latest overture.

CIA shifts stance on Covid-19 origins; claims lab leak 'more likely',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-shifts-stance-on-covid-19-origins-claims-lab-leak-more-likely/articleshow/117567971.cms,"A view of the P4 lab inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is claimed to be the source of the Covid ""leak"" by many

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has changed its official position on the origin of Covid-19, stating on Saturday that the virus was ""more likely"" to have leaked from a Chinese laboratory than to have been transmitted by animals.A CIA spokesperson said in a statement, quoted by AFP, ""CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the Covid-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting."" The agency had not previously made any determination on whether Covid had been unleashed by a laboratory mishap or spilled over from animals.""CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the Covid-19 pandemic remain plausible,"" the spokesperson noted.This new assessment comes after John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the CIA director under Donald Trump's second White House administration on Thursday.Ratcliffe, who previously served as the director of national intelligence from 2020-2021 during Trump's first term, believes that Covid-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology . In an interview published Friday with the right-wing outlet Breitbart, he stated that making an assessment on Covid's origins would be a ""day-one"" priority.""The agency is going to get off the sidelines,"" Ratcliffe told Breitbart.Additionally, a US official told AFP that the shift was based on a new analysis of existing intelligence ordered by previous CIA director William Burns, which was completed before Ratcliffe's arrival this week. Some US agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy, support the lab-leak theory, albeit with varying levels of confidence, while most elements of the intelligence community lean toward natural origins.Ratcliffe emphasised the importance of providing the president with comprehensive intelligence for interactions with China. ""As President Trump deals with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping], he needs to be armed with the very best intelligence and to be able to talk about China in a way that if they caused or contributed to the death of a million Americans, the president needs to be armed with that,"" Ratcliffe said.US intelligence agencies including the CIA have consistently maintained their inability to definitively determine the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reported by the NYT. According to unnamed officials cited by the newspaper, this shift in perspective of them leaning towards 'lab leak' is not based on newly acquired intelligence. Rather, it stems from an analysis of the operational conditions within Wuhan's high-security laboratories during the pre-pandemic period. However, the CIA's spokesperson has emphasised that the market origin theory maintains its credibility, and the agency remains committed to examining any credible new intelligence that surfaces.The origins of Covid-19 is a widely debated topic. Two primary hypotheses have persisted - natural emergence from a Wuhan market or an inadvertent release from a Wuhan research facility.Proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis highlight that the earliest known Covid-19 cases emerged in Wuhan, China, a major coronavirus research hub, roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from the nearest bat populations carrying similar SARS-like viruses. Advocates of the ""lab leak theory"" assert that the virus emerged from research conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory facility in China.","The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has changed its official position on the origin of Covid-19.

PORT SUDAN: A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region has killed 67 people and injured dozens, local activists and a medical source said Saturday, updating an earlier toll.""Thirty-seven of those injured in the drone strike yesterday died today, bringing the number of victims up to 67,"" the source told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation.He added that a number of those injured were still being treated, but could not give an exact figure.The bombing of the Saudi Hospital late Friday had ""led to the destruction"" of the hospital's emergency building, the source said.AFP could not independently verify which of Sudan's warring sides had launched the attack.Since April 2023, the Sudanese army has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who have seized nearly the entire vast western region of Darfur.Since May they have besieged El-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, but have not managed to claim the city where army-aligned militias have repeatedly pushed them back.Last week, the RSF issued an ultimatum demanding army forces and allies leave the city by Wednesday afternoon in advance of an expected offensive.Local activists have reported intermittent fighting since, including repeated artillery fire from the RSF on the famine-hit Abu Shouk displacement camp.On Friday morning alone, heavy shelling killed eight people in the camp, according to civil society group the Darfur General Coordination of Camps for the Displaced and Refugees.The United Nations has voiced alarm, calling on both parties to ensure the protection of the city's civilian population -- some two million people.""The people of El-Fasher have suffered so much already,"" Seif Magango, spokesman of the UN rights office, said Wednesday.According to the medical source, the Saudi Hospital's emergency building had been hit by an RSF drone ""a few weeks ago"".Between December 9 and January 14, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab observed three advanced drones at the RSF-controlled Nyala Airport, some 200 kilometres (124 miles) south.In its report, it said the Chinese-made drones have ""significant electronic surveillance and warfare capabilities and can be equipped with air-to-ground munitions"", but could not verify which countries had purchased them.The United Arab Emirates has been repeatedly accused of funnelling weapons, including drones, to the RSF.United Nations experts determined in December 2023 the allegations were ""credible"", but Abu Dhabi has issued repeated denials in the face of mounting international criticism.In December, it assured the outgoing administration of US president Joe Biden that it was ""not now transferring any weapons"" to the RSF.But on Friday, two US lawmakers said the UAE had violated its promises to Washington and ""is continuing to provide weapons"" to the RSF -- who the United States concluded earlier this month had committed ""genocide"" in Darfur.The RSF's latest attempt to consolidate its hold on war-ravaged Darfur -- a vast region about the size of France, home to a quarter of Sudan's population -- comes as the army claims significant victories elsewhere.Some 850 kilometres east, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Saturday toured the Jaili oil refinery, the country's largest, a day after his forces reclaimed it.In a statement, his ruling Transitional Sovereignty Council said Burhan ""pledged to rebuild what the militia had destroyed"" and rehabilitate a key economic resource.The military on Friday also broke a paramilitary siege on its Khartoum headquarters, which the RSF had encircled since the war began in April 2023.Earlier this month, the army successfully wrested control of key state capital Wad Madani, just south of Khartoum, from the RSF.Since the war began, both the army and the RSF have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians and indiscriminately shelling residential areas.Before leaving office on Monday, the Biden administration sanctioned Burhan, accusing the army of attacking schools, markets and hospitals and using food deprivation as a weapon of war.Across the country, up to 80 percent of healthcare facilities have been forced out of service, according to official figures.In El-Fasher, where ambulances and hospital buildings have been routinely targeted, medical charity Doctors Without Borders said this month the Saudi Hospital was ""the only public hospital with surgical capacity still standing"".The war has so far killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and brought millions to the brink of mass starvation.In the area around El-Fasher, famine has already taken hold in three displacement camps -- Zamzam, Abu Shouk and Al-Salam -- and is expected to expand to five more areas including the city itself by May, according to a UN-backed assessment.","A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region has killed 67 people.

""We've heard that for a long time, like I just heard that they live separate lives.""Then the duo talked about the photo that Barack posted to wish on Michelle Obama's birthday and said that the photo was quite bad. 'I would kill Ben if he put a picture of me looking like no makeup with that lighting on social media,' McCain said, referring to her husband, Ben Domenech. 'I would kill him. So for me it didn't help the rumors, and like why are you putting this like s****y picture of your wife up?'Palmeri said Michelle Obama always hated politics and did not like being the first lady. As they are no longer in politics, this is a chance to drop Washington completely, she said. ""I am not at home with them, but it's not really surprising at this phase of their life and she clearly has very little interest - she's always hated politics! She did not really like being First Lady,"" she said.Michelle and Obama were last seen together in early mid-December when they stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles. The divorce rumors became intense amid speculations that Barack Obama has been dating Jennifer Aniston, though the actor dismissed the rumors last October on Jimmy Kimmel show.Barack and Michelle first met in 1989 when they both worked at a law firm in Chicago. They got married in 1992 and had their first daughter Malia in 2998, and second daughter Sasha in 2001.Barack Obama appeared solo at Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration.

China has a ‘veiled’ warning for Rubio,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-has-a-veiled-warning-for-rubio/articleshow/117568098.cms,"Marco Rubio

BEIJING: China's veteran foreign minister has issued a veiled warning to America's new secretary of state: Behave yourself. Foreign minister Wang Yi conveyed the message in a phone call Friday, their first conversation since Marco Rubio 's confirmation as Trump's top diplomat four days earlier.""I hope you will act accordingly,"" Wang told Rubio, according to a foreign ministry statement, employing a Chinese phrase typically used by a teacher or a boss warning a student or employee to behave and be responsible for their actions.

""Don't read the English translation that they put out because the English translation is never right,"" he said.A US statement on the phone call didn't mention the phrase. It said Rubio told Wang that the Trump administration would advance US interests in its relationship with China and expressed ""serious concern over China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.""","Wang Yi used a Chinese phrase typically used by a teacher or a boss warning a student or employee to behave.

President Trump makes surprise visit to Vegas Casino floor, ""USA, USA"" chants heard near craps table

President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of the United States rejoining the World Health Organization (WHO) during a rally at Las Vegas' Circa Resort & Casino on Saturday.This comes just days after he signed an executive order withdrawing the country from the international group, citing the organization's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and China's influence over the UN's health agency body.Trump expressed his concerns about the United States paying more than its fair share to the WHO compared to other countries like China. He has long criticized the organization for its perceived failures and described the US financial contribution as ""onerous.""The president talked about the possibility of joining WHO again at the rally but only at a reduced payout. ""Maybe we would consider doing it again, I don't know, maybe we would. But, they have to clean it up a bit,"" said Trump.But he added his condition over the fundings from US in comparison to China. ""China pays $39 million for 1.4 billion people and we're paying $500 million for 325 million- I don't know what the hell is wrong with these people,"" also said Trump while taking a jab at his predecessor Joe Biden for blocking his initiatives in 2020 saying that he would've ""done it four years ago"" claiming that when Biden went back in office, US ""paid more than they were paying in the first place.""The president began taking steps to withdraw the United States from the WHO during the final year of his first administration. However, after losing the election to Joe Biden, the Democratic president ultimately blocked the effort on his first day in office.Trump also revealed plans to work with Congress on a bill that would cut taxes and fulfill his campaign promise to prevent any taxes on workers' tips, as well as potentially halting the hiring of over 80,000 new IRS agents. ""Your tips will be 100% yours, won't that be nice?"" he remarked.Additionally, Trump revealed his intention to halt the hiring of over 80,000 new IRS agents, whose salaries were funded by $72 billion provided for the federal agency under the Inflation Reduction Act.""They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,"" he said.Trump thanked his supporters in Nevada for helping him become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state in decades, besting Vice President Kamala Harris by 46,000 votes. ""I just came here because I wanted to thank the people of Nevada for giving us such a big win,"" he said.The president also highlighted the numerous executive actions he signed off on during his inauguration week, which aimed to undo the work of the Biden administration and fulfill campaign promises, such as closing the border and restoring law and order.""This week alone I took nearly 350 executive actions to reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that were inherited from a group of people that didn't know what the hell they were doing,"" Trump said. ""Our message couldn't be more clear: America's decline is over,"" he added.After the speech, Trump walked across the Circa casino's main floor, passing by its purple velvet-covered tables, whilst visitors chanted ""USA, USA."" A gambler at the roulette table wagered, ""Give me $47 on 47,"" referencing Trump's potential role as the 47th president. ""Ohh,"" Trump at the unsuccessful bet, yet continued to sign autographs amidst enthusiastic supporters' cheers.Following his triumph in Nevada, where he secured six electoral votes in November, Trump held his inaugural swing-state rally since assuming office. This marked the first Republican victory in Nevada since George W Bush's win in 2004. His success in Nevada contributed to his comprehensive victory across all seven battleground states, resulting in a substantial electoral majority and enabling his return to the presidency for a non-consecutive second term.","President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of the United States rejoining the World Health Organization (WHO) during a rally at Las Vegas' Circa Resort & Casino on Saturday.

WASHINGTON: The US Senate narrowly confirmed Pete Hegseth as defense secretary on Friday after he survived a bruising struggle with Democrats who decried the Trump nominee as unqualified and unfit to oversee the country's 1.3 million active duty troops and the Pentagon's nearly $850 billion budget.Vice President JD Vance had to cast a tiebreaking vote to confirm Hegseth, after three Republicans - senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - joined all Democrats in opposition. The final vote, 51-50, was the smallest margin for a defense secretary's confirmation since the position was created in 1947.Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, has vowed to bring his self-described ""warrior"" ethos to the defense department, which he says has been made weak by ""woke"" generals and diversity programmes. Republican leaders embraced that outlook as they cheered his confirmation. ""Peace through strength is back under President Trump and Hegseth,"" said senator Roger Wicker.Democrats, who unanimously opposed Hegseth's confirmation, promised to continue their scrutiny of him. ""I am going to watch him like a hawk,"" senator Jack Reed, said, adding: ""I will demand accountability.""Hegseth's selection by President Donald Trump and the confirmation process were complicated by a claim of sexual assault and accusations of abusive behavior, public drunkenness and fiscal mismanagement of two nonprofit veterans groups","Vice President JD Vance had to cast a tiebreaking vote to confirm Pete Hegseth.

The Trump administration on Friday directed federal agencies to start terminating staffers working in positions related to diversity programmes, after placing them on paid leave earlier this week. ""Each agency, department, or commission head shall take action to terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and 'environmental justice' offices and positions within 60 days,"" said a memo from the US Office of Personnel Management, referring to jobs aimed at boosting ""diversity, inclusion and accessibility.""Earlier this week Trump had ordered govt agency heads to submit a written plan for reducing employees in DEI offices by Friday. The reference to environmental justice is new, however.The state department said the US has ceased issuing passports with a gender-neutral 'X' option, following President Donald Trump's order limiting government recognition of transgender identity.The move rolls back the option first introduced under former president Joe Biden's administration and leaves an unknown number of people awaiting further guidance on the fate of their pending applications and already issued passports. Trump, shortly after taking office on Monday, signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to only give the option of male or female, as part of an array of actions aimed at quickly reversing policies enacted by his predecessor.On Saturday, the Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and Trump's plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. afp","The US has ceased issuing passports with a gender-neutral 'X' option, following President Donald Trump's order limiting government recognition of transgender identity.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence.

She also urged the international community to intervene and ensure the restoration of internet services while safeguarding the fundamental rights of the Baloch people.Sharing a post on X, she wrote, ""I appeal to human rights organizations to immediately take notice of the internet blackout in Dalbandin and actively intervene to prevent a potential crackdown on the peaceful Baloch national gathering . Such actions not only stifle freedom of expression and assembly but also set a dangerous precedent of suppressing dissent through force and digital censorship.""""I urge these organizations to pressure the authorities to restore internet services without delay and to ensure that the fundamental rights of the Baloch people to assemble peacefully and voice their concerns are respected. The international community must not remain silent in the face of these repressive measures, as their silence could embolden further human rights violations in the Balochistan,"" the post added.Notably, the internet blackout comes days before Baloch Genocide Remembrance Day , scheduled for January 25, when the people of Balochistan will come together to protest the ongoing atrocities.Serious concerns are being raised due to this history of repression, with fears that the government may use violence to suppress peaceful opposition in Dalbandin once again.The internet blackout heightens concerns among Baloch Youth Conference (BYC) organizers about a possible crackdown on the event. The shutdown severely limits the Baloch people's ability to record and share their experiences of human rights violations, as communication routes are cut off.On Thursday, Mahrang Baloch, in her post on X, said that Pakistauthorities have imposed an internet blackout in Dalbandin. The post noted that the digital crackdown is reminiscent of an unsettling trend. Similar internet restrictions were imposed during the Baloch National Gathering in Gwadar in July last year, where organisers and attendees of the event were brutally suppressed afterwards.",Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch has called on human rights organisations to address the internet blackout in Dalbandin.

"Free Speech In Pakistan: Pakistan introduces law allowing government to block platforms, imprison users for spreading 'disinformation' on social media",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-introduces-law-allowing-government-to-block-platforms-imprison-users-for-spreading-disinformation-on-social-media/articleshow/117490772.cms,"Pakistan's government has tightened its grip on social media with a new law that critics fear will threaten free speech and further erode democratic freedoms.The controversial legislation, passed by the country's lower house of parliament on Thursday, grants sweeping powers to the government to control online content, including the ability to block platforms and imprison users for spreading ""disinformation.""The law requires social media companies to register with a government-controlled authority and gives officials the power to immediately block content deemed ""unlawful and offensive,"" such as criticism of judges, military, or government itself. Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse. This move comes at a time when press freedom in Pakistan is already under increasing pressure. Journalists report facing state pressure, and many media outlets have been instructed to avoid mentioning Imran Khan by name.","Pakistan's lower house of parliament passed a new law on Thursday.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.
