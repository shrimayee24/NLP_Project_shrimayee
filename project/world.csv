KOCHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Malayalam superstar Mohanlal expressed Sunday regret over distress caused by political & social themes in his movie Empuraan. His statement follows backlash over film's alleged portrayal of the '02 Gujarat riots, leading CBFC to mandate 17 changes.""As an artist, it is my duty to ensure that none of my films harbours animosity towards any political movement, ideology or religious group,"" Mohanlal wrote in an FB post. ""I have come to understand certain themes introduced in Empuraan have caused distress among many who care for me... We've collectively decided to remove such themes from the movie."" However, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan (CPM) and VD Satheesan of Congress defended Empuraan, condemning alleged efforts by Sangh Parivar to pressure changes to the film.The film Empuraan, starring Mohanlal, released worldwide on March 27 and grossed over Rs 100 crore at the box office, has drawn sharp criticism from BJP and RSS members in Kerala.RSS-affiliated publication Organiser claimed that some scenes were ""purposefully designed to reinforce the image of Hindus as the primary aggressors during the 2002 riots"".BJP's Kerala unit president Rajeev Chandrasekhar said he would no longer watch the movie. ""I had said that I would watch the movie Empuraan when I heard it was a sequel to Lucifer. But now I have come to know that the makers of the movie themselves have made 17 amendments in the movie and that the movie is undergoing re-censorship. I understand that there were topics in the movie that disturbed Mohanlal fans and other viewers,"" Chandrasekhar wrote on Facebook.""A movie should be watched as a movie. It can't be seen as history. Also, any movie that tries to build a story by distorting the truth is doomed to fail. So, will I watch this sequel to Lucifer? No. Am I disappointed by this type of moviemaking? Yes.""However, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan of CPM and opposition leader VD Satheesan of Congress defended Empuraan, condemning alleged efforts by Sangh Parivar to pressure changes to the film.Vijayan, who watched the film Sunday, praised its impact on the Malayalam film industry and denounced the backlash. ""I watched it amidst widespread hate campaigns unleashed by the Sangh Parivar and communal forces against the film, its actors, and its crew,"" he posted on social media.The CM accused Sangh-linked groups of attempting to suppress the film for depicting historical realities. ""The film references one of the most brutal genocides the country has seen... functionaries of BJP and RSS are issuing open threats. It is not a tribute to democracy when communalists can destroy a work of art and viciously attack artistes for taking a stand against communalism and depicting its horrors,"" he said.Congress's Satheesan accused Sangh of attempting to distort history. ""They believe that freedom of expression means the freedom to create narratives that favour them. Their agenda is to celebrate distorted creations,"" he said.He said coercing filmmakers into altering their work amounted to an attack on artistic freedom. ""It is a sign of utter failure and cowardice. No matter how much one tries to cover it up, historical truths will always stand clear,"" he said.","Mohanlal expresses regret over distress caused by political & social themes in his movie Empuraan.

JAMMU: Security forces continued their “seek-and-shoot” operation Sunday in the forested Sufain area of Kathua district in Jammu division, days after a gunfight left four policemen dead. The confrontation, which erupted Thursday when a search team was ambushed by Pakistani terrorists hiding in the woods, lasted more than 20 hours and also resulted in the deaths of two attackers affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed J&K police said some of the terrorists may have escaped and are moving through the mountainous terrain, an area frequently traversed by local herders in search of pasture for their livestock. Officials have urged residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.The forces have deployed bulletproof vehicles, drones, and sniffer dogs in an effort to track the fugitives, who may be using remote mountain huts built by nomadic herders for shelter.The attackers are believed to be part of the same group that evaded capture last Sunday after a brief shooting near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain forests are about 35km from Sanyal village. A village couple had spotted five armed men moving in the area and alerted police.Security operations have since expanded, with similar searches conducted near Kathera village in Kathua tehsil and Gharh in Billawer.Kathua district has been a key route for militants for over three decades due to its strategic location. It connects Doda and Udhampur districts to the north, providing a passage to Kashmir valley. Experts said the district’s proximity to the Pakistan border and its rugged terrain with dense forests provide ideal hiding spots for terrorists.Police dismissed social media reports suggesting that terrorists had seized service weapons from the fallen policemen. “All weapons and their belongings have been accounted for,” a police spokesperson said. “Some people are spreading rumours. Strict legal action shall be taken against them.”Among those wounded in the gunfight were DSP Dheeraj Katoch, two other policemen, and a soldier from Army’s 1 Para (Special Forces). Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha visited Sunday the govt medical college and hospital in Jammu to check on the wounded men and met their families, assuring them of full support.",Security forces in Jammu continued their operation in Kathua district's Sufain forest after a deadly gunfight with Pakistani terrorists.

PM Modi's Trip dispels saffron rift buzz ahead of key polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-trip-dispels-saffron-rift-buzz-ahead-of-key-polls/articleshow/119774614.cms,".

NAGPUR: PM Modi's visit to RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar's memorial at Smruti Mandir in Nagpur's Reshimbagh reaffirmed Sunday unity between BJP and its ideological fountainhead, while also suggesting consensus-building over the party's next president. This also marked Modi's first visit to Smruti Mandir in a decade since assuming office in 2014.His meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat dispelled speculation of a rift between the two entities as BJP prepares for assembly polls in Bihar and Bengal.The visit coincided with the RSS's 'pratipada' programme, commemorating Gudi Padwa and the Hindu New Year. Modi and Bhagwat's interaction, their first public engagement since the consecration of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya in Jan 2024, drew scrutiny for its potential impact on the selection of BJP's next national president.The question of BJP's next president has garnered attention as the party's current chief JP Nadda has been serving an extended term since joining the Union cabinet in June 2024. With BJP's national council scheduled to convene in Bengaluru in April, discussions in Nagpur may shape the trajectory. RSS has historically played a crucial role in this process and Modi's visit highlighted its continued influence.He paid homage to RSS founder Hedgewar and the organisation's second sarsanghchalak Madhav Golwalkar. In a post on X, the PM described his visit as deeply personal & inspiring. ""Visiting Smruti Mandir on 'varsha pratipada' is special, as it is also the 'jayanti' of param pujya doctor sahab (Hedgewar). Countless people like me draw strength from the vision of doctor sahab and Guruji,"" Modi wrote.Adding another dimension to his Nagpur visit, Modi also stopped at Deekshabhoomi, the site where Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in 1956. Calling the shrine a symbol of social justice and empowerment, the PM reiterated his govt's commitment to Ambedkar's vision for India. ""Deekshabhoomi stands as a beacon of dignity and equality. Generations of Indians remain indebted to Dr Ambedkar for giving us a Constitution that safeguards our rights,"" he wrote on X.PM's visit to the RSS headquarters reaffirmed the party's ideological alignment with the Sangh. His stop at Deekshabhoomi also conveyed a message of inclusivity to marginalised communities.",PM Modi visits RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar's memorial at Smruti Mandir in Nagpur's Reshimbagh.

GOPALGANJ: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday sounded the bugle for Bihar assembly polls due later this year, urging the people to strengthen the hands of PM Modi by voting the BJP-led NDA back to office.Addressing a rally in Gopalganj, a stronghold of the RJD, Shah also charged the opposition party's president Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, both of whom had together governed the state for 15 years, with running a "" jungle raj "", alleging that murders, kidnappings and dacoities became an industry in the state while they were in office.It was the first public meeting addressed by Shah, regarded as the BJP's principal strategist, in Bihar since last year's Lok Sabha polls.""Major businessmen fled the state, worried about their own safety. Lalu also made Bihar infamous the world over because of his involvement in the fodder scam,"" Shah claimed.He said things began to improve when BJP, in alliance with JDU headed by CM Nitish Kumar, formed a government in the state.If the NDA returns to power later this year, Bihar's decades-old problem of annual floods will become a thing of the past, he said.""The people of Bihar have a choice to make between the Lalu-Rabri duo, representing the jungle raj, and development under Modi and Nitish,"" said Shah. ""I hope you all will press the lotus button, in the assembly polls later this year and vote for the BJP-led NDA. The people of Bihar have always shown their affection for Modi. I am sure you will strengthen his hands further,"" he said.Shah had interacted with senior party leaders in the state capital late Saturday night when he is said to have remarked that a victory in Bihar has a far-reaching impact and ""we must strive to win the assembly polls"".Shah pulled no punches in lambasting the RJD supremo for alleged nepotism, accusing him of making his wife the CM, getting his daughter elected to Parliament and ""now both his sons want to become the CM"".","Union home minister Amit Shah urges voters in Bihar to re-elect the BJP-led NDA.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.Recently, the Trump administration has detained individuals with ties to American universities, many of whom have supported pro-Palestinian causes, as part of a crackdown on immigrants. Among the detained is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, arrested under accusations of supporting Hamas. Other individuals detained include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Yunseo Chung, a US resident arrested at a protest, and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar accused of spreading Hamas propaganda.The US government has also taken action against several other activists, including Leqaa Kordia, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Alireza Doroudi, with many facing deportation or detention. Some of these individuals are accused of advocating for violence or engaging in political protests.","The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk quoted a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Clarifying the post, Musk wrote: “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised. It'll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades.”He added that the U.S. would be “very fair” and “very nice” in its approach, despite what he described as unfair treatment by other nations.","US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts.

Trump administration to take over media seating arrangements in White House: 'It doesn’t really matter where people sit',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-to-take-over-media-seating-arrangements-in-white-house-it-doesnt-really-matter-where-people-sit/articleshow/119787413.cms,"Uncertainty over media access

The Trump administration is planning to take over the seating assignments in the White House press briefing room , a senior official has confirmed. The plan, which could impact the relationship significantly between the administration and the media, would strip the White House Correspondents’ Association ( WHCA ) of its long-standing authority to assign seats.The WHCA is an independent organisation responsible for managing the seating chart and press access. The proposed change has sparked concerns among journalists, who see it as an attempt to exert influence over the media and limit independent scrutiny of the administration.Axios first reported on the potential seating changes on Sunday, and Trump allies who view it as a way to marginalise mainstream media and elevate explicitly pro-Trump outlets. A senior White House official confirmed the plan to CNN but declined to provide further details.However, several correspondents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had been expecting such a shift. The move is seen as symbolic and likely to be celebrated by pro-Trump media outlets.""It doesn’t really matter where people sit,"" one White House correspondent remarked. ""But it does matter when the White House tries to impact what questions are asked, and how stories are covered, by taking control away from an elected group.""The WHCA, which is governed by a rotating panel of elected journalists, has yet to issue an official response. Its current president, Eugene Daniels, did not respond to requests for comment regarding the status of the seating chart.It remained unclear whether the administration intended to completely remove major news outlets from their assigned seats or simply reshuffle seating arrangements. Even a minor reordering could alter the dynamics of White House press briefings, potentially giving more prominence to right-wing media personalities and diminishing the presence of mainstream networks.Under the current WHCA-managed seating arrangement, journalists from major TV networks, newswires, newspapers, and radio organisations sit in the front rows. The association updated the chart periodically to reflect shifts in the media landscape, ensuring representation for more than 60 outlets within the 49 available seats. The WHCA also assigned workspace booths and desks for the press corps.Since Trump’s return to office in January, his administration has repeatedly clashed with the press. In February, news agency AP was banned from press conferences and other events. Around the same time, Leavitt announced that the White House, rather than the WHCA, would now handpick the reporters included in the “press pool”—a rotating group of journalists who travel with the president and attend smaller events.In recent weeks, the administration has granted increased access to hyper partisan pro-Trump websites and smaller, lesser-known TV networks while excluding some mainstream outlets. During a recent briefing, Trump enthusiastically praised a reporter from the far-right network One America News after receiving what appeared to be a complimentary question.Leavitt has also introduced a so-called “new media seat” at briefings, repurposing a chair formerly occupied by a White House aide to accommodate right-wing podcasters and independent commentators. Many of these pro-Trump media figures, however, are not based in Washington, DC, and do not regularly attend press briefings, potentially limiting their participation.The White House's effort to reshape press access extends beyond the briefing room. The Pentagon recently implemented a controversial ""rotation"" programme, removing major outlets from their long-established workspaces and replacing them with smaller media organisations that are openly supportive of Trump.This is not the first time the Trump administration has attempted to alter the press seating arrangement. During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the White House tried to reassign CNN’s Kaitlan Collins from her front-row seat to the back of the room. The move was widely seen as punitive. Both Collins and the affected reporter refused to comply, and the administration ultimately backed down.At the time, then-WHCA President Jonathan Karl defended the association’s authority, “there is a decades-long bipartisan tradition of the WHCA determining the seating assignments in the briefing room,” hence, “we will challenge any effort to pick and choose what outlets are there or the manner in which they are in there.”","The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) is responsible for managing the seating chart and press access.

Myanmar military junta accused of bombing raid hours after quake

Myanmar’s military junta has continued air strikes even after a massive earthquake hit the country. While some armed groups halted fighting to focus on the disaster, the junta carried on with aerial attacks, reported news agency AFP.The 7.7-magnitude quake struck Myanmar on Friday, killing at least 1,700 people and destroying thousands of homes and buildings. Tremors were felt in neighboring countries, including Thailand and Vietnam.One of the air strikes targeted the Danu People's Liberation Army (DPLA), an ethnic armed group in northern Shan state. Five military aircraft bombed their base in Naungcho township, killing seven fighters, including five female soldiers. A DPLA officer said their soldiers tried to reach bunkers when they heard the aircraft, but a direct bomb hit killed those inside. Other reports of air strikes have also surfaced.Human rights groups and UN officials have condemned the military’s actions. Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur for Myanmar, called for an immediate ceasefire, saying it was “incredible” that the junta continued bombing people after the earthquake.""Anyone who influences the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable. I'm calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations."" Andrews told BBC.Human Rights Watch also accused the military of prioritising its war over humanitarian needs.The National Unity Government (NUG), representing the ousted civilian administration, announced that its armed forces would pause offensive military operations for two weeks in earthquake-affected areas, starting Sunday. However, defensive actions would continue if necessary.The military has struggled in ground battles over the past year, losing large areas of land to anti-coup forces.

Could Donald Trump actually serve a third term as US President? What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-donald-trump-actually-serve-a-third-term-as-us-president-what-we-know/articleshow/119782747.cms,"Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in NBC News interview

Can Trump legally run for a third term?



America 101: Why Do We Have Presidential Term Limits? | History

Are there any alternative ways?



An effort to 'dismantle democracy' or does America 'need him'?



Donald Trump made headlines again on Sunday after he reiterated that he might pursue a third term as US president, even though such a move would challenge the constitutional two-term limit established by the 22nd Amendment .“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said, adding, “I’m not joking,” in a telephone interview with NBC News.Later, talking to the reporters, he said that there were demands from the people for him to run for a third term.""I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged. I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go,” Trump said, who would be 82 by the end of his potential second term.Though a third term for any US president would typically be unthinkable, Donald Trump has never followed political norms. Throughout his time in office, he has repeatedly tested the boundaries of presidential power and has shown a willingness to bend or even break the law to remain in office.The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.Any attempt by Trump to remain in office beyond this limit would be legally questionable, and it remains uncertain how seriously he intends to pursue the idea.When asked if one option could be having vice president JD Vance run for president and then ""pass the baton"" back to him, Trump acknowledged, ""Well, that’s one. But there are others too. There are others."" However, he refused to elaborate further.Nine US presidents have assumed office without being elected, all having previously served as vice presidents before stepping in due to the death or resignation of their predecessors. This historical precedent highlights alternative paths to the presidency beyond direct election. However, whether a two-term president could return to office via the vice presidency remains a legal gray area, The Conversation reported.The 22nd Amendment restricts a president to two elected terms but does not explicitly prevent them from serving as vice president. Meanwhile, the 12th Amendment states that anyone “constitutionally ineligible” for the presidency cannot be vice president. It is unclear whether this applies to a two-term president or only to basic eligibility requirements such as age, citizenship, and residency.If this issue were taken to the US Supreme Court, their ruling could determine whether a Trump-Vance ticket in 2024 might evolve into a Vance-Trump ticket in 2028. If elected under such a scenario, Vance could resign, allowing Trump to assume the presidency once again—a legal loophole that, if upheld, could redefine presidential succession.The political leaders reacted differently to Trump's remark with the right-wing leaders favouring the US president while the Democrats called it an effort to ""dismantle democracy"".“This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy. If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term,” Democrat and representative Daniel Goldman said.Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term. “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards,"" she said.","The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.

What turned the protests violent?



NEW DELHI: At least 100 protesters were detained after pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Nepal's Kathmandu.The unrest left two people dead, including a journalist, and over 30 others injured, prompting authorities to impose a curfew and call in the army.The curfew was lifted on Friday and has been lifted from 7 am on Saturday, according to a notice issued by the Kathmandu District Administration Office.The pro-monarchist agitators were demanding the reinstatement of the monarchy and a Hindu kingdom, which was abolished in 2008 as part of a peace deal that ended a decade-long civil war in which more than 16,000 people were killed.Nepalis blame corruption, economic struggles, and instability for their frustration, leading to renewed calls for the return of the monarchy.The monarchists have been demanding the restoration of the monarchy since the former king appealed for support in a video message telecast on Democracy Day (February 19).The pro-monarchy activists also held a rally on March 9 in support of the former king, who landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport from Pokhara after visiting religious places in different parts of the country.The government also decided to take all necessary steps to curb possible demonstrations and protests by pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu parties, a minister told the Post.The Nepal cabinet meeting on Friday condemned the killings and discussed the ""evolving security situation"" following protests in the Tinkune area near Koteshwar, Kathmandu.""It has become crystal clear that Gyanendra Shah (the last reigning king of Nepal) is behind all these acts. Gyanendra Shah's intent is culpable. It is time for the government to take strict action,"" said former PM of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda.'""An investigation should be conducted to bring the criminals to justice, and Gyanendra Shah cannot be spared—given absolute freedom, it is unacceptable for the Nepali citizens, and the government should be serious about this issue,"" he added.According to authorities, the demonstration turned violent after Durga Prasai, the convenor of the agitation, broke the security barricade, riding a bulletproof vehicle, and headed towards Baneshwor, where the Parliament building is located.Those arrested included the general secretary of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Dhawal Shumsher Rana, and a central member of the party, Rabindra Mishra, among others.Prasai, the key person behind the violent demonstration, is at large, Superintendent of Police of Kathmandu District Police Range Apil Bohara said.According to the police, 53 police personnel, 22 Armed Police Force personnel, and 35 protestors were injured in Friday's incident.During the violent demonstration, 14 buildings were set on fire and nine were vandalized. Nine government vehicles were torched, and six private vehicles were vandalized.Protesters also attacked the Kantipur Television building and Annapurna Media House in the Tinkune area.","Pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Kathmandu.

""But if the US leaves us no choice, as with the tariffs on steel and aluminum, we will respond as a united European Union.""Trump's tariff hikes have sparked tensions with both allies and adversaries, with the EU preparing countermeasures against the steel and aluminum duties that took effect in mid-March.

"Pakistan kills own civilians during military operation, admits 'unintended consequences'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-kills-own-civilians-during-military-operation-admits-unintended-consequences/articleshow/119742670.cms,"AI image

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

"Deadline looms for Pakistan’s Afghan refugees, tensions soar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/deadline-looms-for-pakistans-afghan-refugees-tensions-soar/articleshow/119723762.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s deadline to expel Afghan refugees by March 31 is intensifying a bitter standoff with Afghanistan, pushing their fragile relationship to the brink.The policy, part of Islamabad’s “Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan”, targets over 800,000 Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders and countless others without documents, sparking a humanitarian crisis and diplomatic rifts. For Afghans like Zahra, a 32-year-old mother in Rawalpindi, the stakes are personal: “We fled war once. Now they are sending us back to it.”Since the expulsion drive kicked off in late 2023, over 842,000 Afghans have left Pakistan, with more than 40,000 forcibly deported, according to govt figures.Authorities have urged voluntary departures before the deadline, warning of mass deportation starting April 1. Yet, a glimmer of hope emerged this week for some when Rana Sanaullah, a senior adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif, suggested that the cutoff might be reconsidered -- a rare hint of flexibility amid unrelenting pressure.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has slammed Pakistan, accusing it of using arrests and harassment to drive out all Afghans, not just the undocumented.Pakistan’s foreign ministry fired back, insisting its actions target only illegal migrants. The tit-for-tat has fueled a narrative of distrust, with Islamabad blaming Afghan soil for cross-border attacks and Kabul rejecting the claims outright.Pakistani officials link Afghan refugees to rising militancy and crime. The Taliban denies the charge, urging Pakistan to stop scapegoating its citizens.On the ground, fear grips Afghan communities. In Peshawar, Karachi and other Pakistani cities, businesses are shuttering as families brace for the worst. Many hold valid papers or await resettlement in the US -- delayed by policies like US refugee program’s suspension under President Donald Trump -- but face police raids nonetheless.UN reports a 45-fold surge in arrests in Islamabad and Rawalpindi since early 2024, with rights groups decrying beatings and detentions of even documented Afghans.","Pakistan's deadline to expel Afghan refugees by March 31 is intensifying a bitter standoff with Afghanistan.
