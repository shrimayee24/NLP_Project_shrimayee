NEW DELHI: Congress Wednesday reappointed Sam Pitroda as chairman of Indian Overseas Congress over a month and half after he resigned following a major controversy over his remarks at the peak of elections on ""inheritance tax"" and analogies on India's diversity ascribed as ""racist"" by opponents.

Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said on X, ""During the recent election campaign Sam Pitroda had made some statements that were totally unacceptable to Congress. By mutual consent he stepped down as chairman of Overseas Indian Congress. Subsequently he clarified the context in which statements were made and how they were later distorted by Modi campaign."" Ramesh added that "" Congress president has reappointed him on the assurance he will not in future leave room for such controversies to arise.""

Pitroda's proximity to the Gandhi family is well known and it is now assumed that he will be careful with his words.Meanwhile, BJP's national spokesperson C R Kesavan lashed out at Congress saying the ""reappointment is an egregious insult to all the good citizens of our country.""

US rep Lauren Boebert wins republican house primary

Polls closed at 9 pm (US time)

What next?

NEW DELHI: George Latimer , a Democratic Party politician , and a pro-Israel centrist , defeated US Representative Jamaal Bowman on Tuesday (local time) in a New York Congressional district election.Latimer successfully defeated one of the progressive members of Congress, who was also known for being a vocal critic of Israel's policies. Bowman had previously leveled accusations against Israel, claiming that the country had perpetrated genocide in Gaza, a region where a significant number of Palestinians have lost their lives due to military actions.Latimer, a former state legislator who has held the position of Westchester County executive since 2018, entered the race after being encouraged by Jewish community leaders. His campaign received substantial financial support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a prominent pro-Israel lobbying organization.In the previous year, the US Congress took the step of officially reprimanding Bowman for his actions during a congressional session. While Democrats were attempting to delay a vote to prevent a government shutdown, Bowman set off a fire alarm, causing an evacuation of the building, BBC reported.The primary race saw Latimer receiving support from Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State. On the other hand, Bowman had the backing of prominent figures such as Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known left-wing representative, and Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont.In other notable congressional contests, John Avlon, a former CNN political analyst, has won the Democratic primary race in New York's 1st Congressional District and defeated challenging Nancy Goroff, who has lived in Suffolk County for more than two decades.Avlon will now face Rep. Nick LaLota, the Republican incumbent, in November. While President Joe Biden eked out a 0.2-point win in the district in 2020, LaLota cruised to an 11-point victory two years later. The Democratic House Majority PAC has characterized the 1st Congressional District as ""one of the most competitive districts in the country,"" while the Cook Political Report has called it ""likely Republican.""US rep Lauren Boebert won the republican primary in a US house race that she jumped into last year, surviving a scandal over a video of her at a Denver theater and accusations of carpetbagging after fleeing what could have been a tough reelection bid in her current district.Boebert built national hard-line conservative stardom through a take-no-prisoners political style in the House.That clout likely made it easier for her to weather the scandals of the last year, which included the video of her vaping and causing a disturbance at a musical production of ""Beetlejuice.""Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles.Meanwhile, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, state Rep. Stefani Zinerman faces a challenge from Eon Huntley, who is supported by the Democratic Socialists of America.In the Hudson Valley, state Rep. Didi Barrett is being challenged by Claire Cousin, who has questioned Barrett's record on environmental issues and emphasized the need for more affordable housing. Lastly, in East Harlem, state Rep. Eddie Gibbs is facing Xavier Santiago in a race that has turned into a debate over representation and has seen personal insults exchanged between the candidates.Polls will close at 9 pm Tuesday. Voters can find their local polling places on the Board of Elections website.New York is a closed primary state, meaning Democrats and Republicans can vote only in their own parties' primaries. Unaffiliated or independent voters cannot participate in the primary. The last day to register to vote before the primaries was June 15, and early voting ended Sunday.All absentee ballots must be dropped off at a polling place by 9 pm or postmarked June 25.The winner will face a challenging battle against the Republican incumbent in November.The Democratic-led state Legislature is also up for election in November, with several Assembly primary races expected to be closely contested. These races highlight the ongoing divide between institutional and progressive Democrats within the party, particularly on issues such as housing and criminal justice.(With inputs from agencies)",Former CNN personality John Avlon wins Democratic primary in New York's 1st Congressional District.

Azm-e-Istehkam: Pakistan's new military operation to take on TTP and other militant groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/what-is-azm-e-istehkam-pakistans-new-military-operation-against-militants/articleshow/111255323.cms,"China has pressured Pakistan to crack down on the armed violence against CPEC targets.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and the Taliban rulers in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Azm-e-Istehkam aims to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan.

""Diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation.""Gallant, speaking at the opening of the meeting with Austin, said that ""we are working closely together to achieve an agreement but we must also discuss readiness on every possible scenario.The Israeli army said last week that plans for an offensive in Lebanon were ""approved and validated"" amid escalating cross-border clashes, but Washington is seeking to lower the temperature and head off another major conflict in the Middle East.Gallant is on a visit to Washington seeking to reaffirm the value of ties with Israel's top ally after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly chastised the United States for what he said was a delay in weapons deliveries.The US government insists that only one shipment of bombs has been held up over concerns about their use in populated areas, and that other arms deliveries are proceeding as usual.The United States is Israel's main supplier of weapons but the growing death toll from the Gaza conflict has piled pressure on President Joe Biden to take action and fueled tensions between his administration and Netanyahu.Gallant met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington the previous day, with the top US diplomat calling on Israel to avoid escalation in Lebanon.The Israeli minister also held talks with CIA chief Bill Burns, the key US point man in negotiations to free hostages from Hamas, which launched an unprecedented attack on Israel in October that sparked a devastating conflict in Gaza.Netanyahu has said Israeli forces are winding up the most intense part of the Gaza war and will redeploy to the northern border, although he has cast the move as defensive.Israel and Hezbollah last fought a full-scale war in 2006 when a cross-border Hezbollah attack sparked 34 days of fighting that took a heavy toll on Lebanon, especially the country's south.","US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant at the Pentagon on Tuesday.

US jails ex-Honduras president Juan Orlando Hernandez for 45 years on drugs charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-jails-ex-honduras-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-for-45-years-on-drugs-charges/articleshow/111295233.cms,"A New York court on Wednesday handed down a 45-year prison sentence to former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez , following his conviction for trafficking massive amounts of cocaine into the United States . Protesters gathered outside the courthouse in Manhattan, holding signs denouncing Hernandez's crimes.Judge Kevin Castel stated, ""The role of Mr Hernandez was to use his political power as president of Congress and president of Honduras to limit the risks of drug traffickers in exchange of money."" Castel noted that Hernandez provided support from the police and military, facilitating the shipment of 400 tons of drugs worth $10 billion at market prices to the US.The sentence, which included an $8 million fine, was less than the life imprisonment sought by prosecutors. However, given Hernandez's age of 55, he may spend the rest of his life in prison. Hernandez's legal team has indicated their intention to appeal the conviction.Prosecutors accused Hernandez of turning Honduras into a ""narco-state"" during his presidency from 2014 to 2022. He was convicted in March of facilitating the smuggling of approximately 500 tons of cocaine, primarily from Colombia and Venezuela, to the United States via Honduras since 2004, long before his presidency. Hernandez allegedly used the drug money to enrich himself, finance his political campaigns, and commit electoral fraud in the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections.Initially, Hernandez presented himself as a champion of the war on drugs and was seen by Washington as an ally in the fight. In 2017, the United States was among the first countries to recognize his re-election, despite the opposition's allegations of fraud and violent protests that resulted in around 30 deaths.Hernandez's downfall was swift. Immediately after handing over power to the new left-wing president Xiomara Castro, the ex-president was shackled and paraded before journalists.

NEW YORK: A court in New York on Wednesday sentenced former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to 45 years in prison after he was convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States.Anti-Hernandez protesters gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse ahead of sentencing brandishing placards decrying the former head of state's crimes with one declaring ""Narco government -- makes the people emigrate.""""The role of Mr Hernandez was to use his political power as president of Congress and president of Honduras to limit the risks of drug traffickers in exchange of money,"" said Judge Kevin Castel as the disgraced statesman stood impassively.He said Hernandez provided police and military support and helped to send 400 tons of drugs -- worth $10 billion at market prices -- to the United States.In a speech ahead of sentencing, Hernandez, who wore prison garb and used a walking stick to enter court, was interrupted by the judge for contesting the trial's outcome and insisting he was wrongly charged.The sentence, which also included an $8 million fine, was less than the life imprisonment that prosecutors had sought -- although Hernandez's age, 55, means he may die behind bars.""He's going to pursue every single possible legal remedy that he can pursue,"" Hernandez's lawyer Renato Stabile told reporters outside court.Hernandez, who US federal prosecutors said turned his Central American country into a ""narco-state"" during his 2014-2022 presidency, has previously indicated through his legal team he would appeal his conviction.He was convicted in March of having facilitated the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine -- mainly from Colombia and Venezuela -- to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before he became president.Hernandez used the drug money to enrich himself and finance his political campaign, and commit electoral fraud in the 2013 and 2017 elections, prosecutors said.He had presented himself as a champion of the war on drugs and was initially seen by Washington as an ally in the fight.In 2017, the United States was one of the first countries to recognize his re-election, while the opposition denounced fraud against a backdrop of violent protests that left some 30 people dead.He was extradited to the United States in 2022 using a law he had himself helped to pass as Congress president under pressure from Washington, accused of aiding drug smugglers in return for millions of dollars in bribes.US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hernandez ""abused his power to support one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world, and the people of Honduras and the United States bore the consequences.""The fall of Hernandez, who is known in his country as ""JOH,"" was abrupt.No sooner had he handed over power to the new left-wing president Xiomara Castro, the outgoing leader was shackled and paraded in front of journalists.Hernandez follows in the footsteps of other former Latin American heads of state convicted in the United States, including Panama's Manuel Noriega in 1992 and Guatemala's Alfonso Portillo in 2014.The short, athletic leader was known for his military haircut, having served as an officer before training as a lawyer, completing a masters degree in New York in 1995.His legal woes began in earnest in 2018 when his brother, Juan Antonio Hernandez, was arrested in Miami and sentenced in March 2021 to life imprisonment for ""large-scale"" drug trafficking.After his arrest in Honduras in February 2022, Hernandez said he was a victim of ""revenge"" by the drug lords, many of whom testified against him in New York.","Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez sentenced to 45 years in prison.

John O'Keefe

Alleged police corruption

NEW DELHI: From the past few years, Karen Read’s murder trial has been surrounded by the controversy of a fatal love story and police corruption since John O'Keefe , her partner was found dead outside a fellow officer’s house in Canton, Massachusetts in 2022. The court, on Wednesday, will begin a second day of deliberation of the trial.Read has been accused by the prosecutors of the victim of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the accident spot. According to Court TV, the duo were dating for two years before O'Keefe’s death. The alleged involvement of Michael Proctor , a state police trooper, in planting false evidence against Read at the crime scene has also made headlines.Now, the question is arising whether Read is guilty of killing her alleged boyfriend or is it a police cover-up to save the real culprits.Citing a witness, the Associated Press reported a fight that erupted between the couple in 2021 in Cape Cod over how O’Keefe treated her. The witness also said how Read became angry after accusing O'Keefe of kissing another woman during Aruba vacation.Read and O’Keefe were drinking at a Canton bar before the argument, prosecutors said.According to the prosecutors, Read’s SUV hit O'Keefe outside the home of Brian Albert. Albert was hosting an after-party at his residence.Read was arrested on February 1, 2022. However, she got bail the next day.Alan Jackson , Read's lawyer has highlighted the alleged police corruption in the murder case and called it a cover-up. He called Read a ‘convenient outsider’ and thus being framed to save the real culprit.“Ladies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,” Jackson said.“You have been lied to in this courtroom. Your job is to make sure you don’t ever ever look the other way,” he said in the Tuesday argument.Michael Proctor is also accused of sending derogatory text messages to friends and family about Read.Proctor said, ""She's a whackjob (about Read)"" and ""hopefully she kills herself"" in his chats.Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally , however, denied any cover-up. He presented evidence before the jurors mentioning about the voice message in which Read is screaming, “John, I (expletive) hate you!”According to Lally, four witnesses had heard Read saying “I hit him. I hit him. Oh my God. I hit him.”Read, 44, if convicted in the O'Keefe’s murder case, will be sentenced for life.","Karen Read's murder trial has been surrounded by the controversy of a fatal love story and police corruption.

Bolivian general arrested after apparent failed coup attempt as government faces new crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bolivian-general-arrested-after-apparent-failed-coup-attempt-as-government-faces-new-crisis/articleshow/111300979.cms,"LA PAZ: Led by a top general vowing to ""restore democracy,"" armoured vehicles rammed the doors of Bolivia's government palace Wednesday in what the president called a coup attempt , then quickly retreated - the latest crisis in the South American country facing a political battle and an economic crisis.Within hours, the nation of 12 million people saw a rapidly moving scenario in which the troops seemed to take control of the government of president Luis Arce . He vowed to stand firm and named a new army commander, who immediately ordered the troops to stand down.Soon the soldiers pulled back, along with a line of military vehicles , ending the rebellion after just three hours. Hundreds of Arce's supporters then rushed the square outside the palace, waving Bolivian flags , singing the national anthem and cheering.The soldiers' retreat was followed by the arrest of army chief gen. Juan Jose Zuniga , after the attorney general opened an investigation.Government minister Eduardo del Castillo said that in addition to Zuniga, former navy vice Adm. Juan Arnez Salvador was taken into custody.""What was this group's goal? The goal was to overturn the democratically elected authority,"" del Castillo told journalists in announcing the arrests.The apparent coup attempt came as the country has faced months of tensions and political fights between Arce and his one-time ally, former leftist presidentEvo Morales , over control of the ruling party. It also came amid a severe economic crisis.The clashes have paralysed the government's efforts to deal with the economic crisis. For example, Morales' allies in Congress have consistently thwarted Arce's attempts to take on debt to relieve some of the pressure.Zuniga referenced that paralysis during the rebellion, telling reporters the military was tired of the infighting and was seeking ""to restore democracy.""""We are listening to the cry of the people because for many years an elite has taken control of the country,"" he said, adding that politicians are ""destroying the country: look at what situation we are in, what crisis they have left us in.""""The armed forces intend to restore the democracy, to make it a true democracy,"" he said.The rapidly unfolding crisis began in the early afternoon as the streets of La Paz started filling with soldiers. Arce tweeted that the troops deployment was irregular, and soon he and other political figures warned of an attempted coup.Still, the apparent attempt to depose the sitting president seemed to lack any meaningful support, and even Arce's rivals closed ranks to defend democracy and repudiate the uprising.In a twist, Zuniga claimed in comments to journalists before his arrest that Arce himself told the general to storm the palace in a political move. ""The president told me: 'The situation is very screwed up, very critical. It is necessary to prepare something to raise my popularity',"" Zuniga quoted the Bolivian leader as saying.Zuniga said he asked Arce if he should ""take out the armoured vehicles?"" and Arce replied, ""Take them out.""Justice minister Ivan Lima denied Zuniga's claims, saying the general was lying and trying to justify his actions, for which he said he will face justice.Prosecutors will seek the maximum sentence of 15 to 20 years in prison for Zuniga, Lima said via the social media platform X, ""for having attacked democracy and the constitution.""The spectacle shocked Bolivians, no stranger to political unrest; in 2019 Morales was ousted as president following an earlier political crisis.As the crisis unfolded Wednesday, Arce confronted Zuniga in the palace hallway, as shown on video on Bolivian television. ""I am your captain, and I order you to withdraw your soldiers, and I will not allow this insubordination,"" Arce said.Surrounded by ministers, he added: ""Here we are, firm in Casa Grande, to confront any coup attempt. We need the Bolivian people to organize.""Less than an hour later, Arce announced new heads of the army, navy and air force amid the roar of supporters, and thanked the country's police and regional allies for standing by him. Arce said the troops who rose against him were ""staining the uniform"" of the military.""I order all that are mobilized to return to their units,"" said the newly named army chief Jose Wilson Sanchez. ""No one wants the images we're seeing in the streets.""Shortly after, the armoured vehicles roared out of the plaza, tailed by hundreds of military fighters, as police in riot gear set up blockades outside the government palace.The incident was met with a wave of outrage by other regional leaders, including the organization of American States, Chilean president Gabriel Boric, the leader of Honduras, and former Bolivian leaders.Bolivia has seen intensifying protests in recent months over the economy's precipitous decline from one of the continent's fastest-growing two decades ago to one of its most crisis-stricken.Arce and Morales have been battling for the future of Bolivia's splintering movement for socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of elections in 2025.Following Wednesday's chaos, reports on local media showed Bolivians stocking up on food and other essentials in supermarkets, concerned about what will come next.But addressing supporters outside the presidential palace, the country's vice president, David Choquehuanca, vowed: ""Never again will the Bolivian people permit coup attempts.""","Army chief Gen.

Prosecutors drop nearly 80 arrests from a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prosecutors-drop-nearly-80-arrests-from-a-pro-palestinian-protest-at-the-university-of-texas/articleshow/111300705.cms,"DALLAS: Nearly 80 criminal trespass arrests stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas have been dismissed , a prosecutor said Wednesday, the latest dropped charges against demonstrators arrested on college campuses across the US this spring.Delia Garza, a democrat who is the elected attorney for Travis County, said 79 criminal trespass cases that were dismissed all stemmed from the April 29 protest. She said cases involving other offenses remain pending.Garza said her office determined it couldn't meet the legal burden to prove the cases beyond a reasonable doubt. She said factors that were considered included whether the protesters' right to free speech had been violated, whether prosecutors had sufficient evidence to seek a conviction and if pursuing the case was in the interest of justice.At campuses across the US this spring, demonstrators sparred over the Israel-Hamas war. Texas' protest and others grew out of Columbia University 's early demonstrations.Last week, prosecutors in New York announced that dozens of Columbia students who were arrested for occupying a campus building as part of a pro-Palestinian protest would have their criminal charges dropped. The Manhattan district attorney's office said it would not pursue criminal charges for 31 of the 46 people initially arrested on trespassing charges inside the administration building.On April 29 at UT, officers in riot gear encircled about 100 sitting protesters, dragging or carrying them out one by one amid screams. Another group of demonstrators trapped police and a van full of arrestees between buildings, creating a mass of bodies pushing and shoving. Officers used pepper spray and flash-bang devices to clear the crowd.The university said in a statement at the time that many of the protesters weren't affiliated with the school and that encampments were prohibited on the campus in the state capital. The school also alleged that some demonstrators were ""physically and verbally combative"" with university staff, prompting officials to call law enforcement. The Texas department of public safety said arrests were made at the behest of the university and Texas gov. Greg Abbott.Garza said she wished that state and university leadership had looked for ""another solution to allow these students to voice what they felt like they needed to voice."" She said the reaction to the protests showed that elected leaders ""continue to prioritize extreme government outreach over actual public safety.""In a statement, UT said the school was ""deeply disappointed"" by Garza's actions, adding that the school ""will continue to use the law enforcement and administrative tools at our disposal to maintain safety and operational continuity for our 53,000 students who come to campus to learn, regardless of whether the criminal justice system shares this commitment.""""Free speech is welcome on our campus. Violating laws or rules is not,"" the statement said. ""Actions that violate laws and Institutional Rules should be met with consequences, not with political posturing and press conferences.""","Nearly 80 criminal trespass arrests stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas have been dismissed.

Death Sentence: Texas man executed for 2001 abduction and killing of 18-year-old woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-man-executed-for-2001-abduction-and-killing-of-18-year-old-woman/articleshow/111300159.cms,"HUNTSVILLE: A Texas man who admitted he kidnapped, sexually assaulted and fatally shot an 18-year-old woman in 2001 was executed Wednesday evening.Ramiro Gonzales , 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 PM following a chemical injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville for the January 2001 killing of Bridget Townsend.Gonzales was repeatedly apologetic to the victim's relatives in his last statement from the execution chamber.""I can't put into words the pain I have caused y'all, the hurt, what I took away that I cannot give back. I hope this apology is enough,"" he said.""I never stopped praying that you would forgive me and that one day I would have this opportunity to apologize. I owe all of you my life and I hope one day you will forgive me,"" he added, just before the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began flowing.As the drug took effect, he took seven breaths, then began sounds like snores. Within less than a minute, all movement had stopped.Gonzales kidnapped Townsend, who would have turned 41 on Wednesday, from a rural home in Bandera County, northwest of San Antonio. He later took her to his family's ranch in neighboring Medina County, where he sexually assaulted her before killing her. Her body wasn't found until October 2002, when Gonzales led authorities to her remains in southwest Texas after he had received two life sentences for kidnapping and raping another woman.""We have finally witnessed justice be being served,"" Townsend's brother, David, said after watching the execution. ""This day marks the end of a long and painful journey for our family. For over two decades we have endured unimaginable pain and heartache.""He said Gonzales' death ""provides us a little bit of peace. I do want to say we are not joyous. We are not happy. This is a very, very sad day for everyone all the way around.""The US supreme court declined a defense plea to intervene about 1 and 1/2 hours before the execution's scheduled start time. The high court rejected arguments by Gonzales' lawyers that he had taken responsibility for what he did and that a prosecution expert witness now says he was wrong in testifying that Gonzales would be a future danger to society, a legal finding needed to impose a death sentence .""He has earnestly devoted himself to self-improvement, contemplation, and prayer, and has grown into a mature, peaceful, kind, loving, and deeply religious adult. He acknowledges his responsibility for his crimes and has sought to atone for them and to seek redemption through his actions,"" Gonzales' lawyers had written Monday in their unsuccessful request to the supreme court for a stay of execution. After re-evaluating Gonzales in 2022, Gripon said his prediction was wrong.Earlier this month, a group of 11 evangelical leaders from Texas and around the country asked the parole board and gov Greg Abbott to halt the execution and grant clemency. They had said Gonzalez was helping other death row inmates through a faith-based program.In video submitted as part of his clemency request to the Texas board of pardons and paroles, Gonzales admitted responsibility.""I just want (Townsend's mother) to know how sorry I really am. I took everything that was valuable from a mother,"" said Gonzales, who was 18 years old at the time. ""So, every day it's a continual task to do everything that I can to feel that responsibility for the life that I took.""On Monday, the parole board voted 7-0 against commuting Gonzales' death sentence to a lesser penalty. Members also rejected granting him a six-month reprieve.Prosecutors described Gonzales as a sexual predator who told police he ignored Townsend's pleas to spare her life. They argued that jurors reached the right decision on a death sentence because he had a long criminal history and showed no remorse.""The State's punishment case was overwhelming,"" the Texas attorney general's office said. ""Even if Dr. Gripon's testimony were wiped from the punishment slate, it would not have mattered.""Gonzales' execution was the second this year in Texas and the eighth in the US on Thursday, Oklahoma is scheduled to execute Richard Rojem for the 1984 abduction, rape and killing of a 7-year-old girl.","Ramiro Gonzales, 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 PM following a chemical injection.

US Congress adopts resolution seeking independent probe into Pakistan's general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-congress-adopts-resolution-seeking-independent-probe-into-pakistans-general-election/articleshow/111298764.cms,"WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution by an overwhelming vote supporting democracy and human rights in Pakistan, urging an independent investigation into claims of irregularities in the country's February 8 general elections. Pakistan's general elections were plagued by a nationwide mobile internet shutdown on election day, arrests and violence during the lead-up, and unusually delayed results. These issues led to widespread accusations that the vote had been rigged.Lawmakers supporting resolution HR 901, titled 'Expressing support for democracy and human rights in Pakistan', said that the overwhelming support highlighted the United States' commitment to promoting democratic values globally.The resolution passed on Tuesday by an overwhelming 368-7 vote urged US President Joe Biden to collaborate with Pakistan in upholding democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.It emphasised the importance of free and fair elections, calling for a thorough and independent investigation into any claims of interference or irregularities in Pakistan's 2024 elections.The resolution emphasised the need for Pakistani public participation in the democratic process, months after the general elections were contested as rigged.Jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is among those opposing the election results, citing significant obstacles faced by its candidates, leading them to run as independents without their iconic bat symbol due to a legal battle with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).Following the elections, Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Bilawal Bhutto-led Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) formed a coalition government, leaving PTI and other parties in opposition.The resolution calls for a ""full and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities in Pakistan's February 2024 election.""It also condemns ""attempts to suppress the people of Pakistan's participation in their democracy, including through harassment, intimidation, violence, arbitrary detention, restrictions on access to the Internet and telecommunications, or any violation of their human, civil, or political rights.""It also denounces ""any effort to subvert the political, electoral, or judicial processes of Pakistan.""Congressman Rich McCormick, a Georgia Republican, sponsored the resolution. Congressman Daniel Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, co-sponsored it. The original resolution was introduced in the House on November 30, 2023, and the text was amended on June 18 this year, the Dawn newspaper reported.Meanwhile, Pakistan on Wednesday criticised Resolution 901, saying it was neither constructive nor objective due to its perceived lack of understanding of the country's political situation and electoral process.Responding to media inquiries regarding the resolution, Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch confirmed that Pakistan had noted its passage.""We believe that the timing and context of this particular resolution do not align well with the positive dynamics of our bilateral ties and stem from an incomplete understanding of the political situation and electoral process in Pakistan,"" Baloch was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune newspaper.She emphasised that Pakistan, as the world's second-largest parliamentary democracy and fifth-largest democracy overall, remains committed to constitutionalism, human rights, and the rule of law in line with its national interests.Baloch stressed the importance of constructive dialogue and engagement based on mutual respect and understanding.""Such resolutions are therefore neither constructive nor objective. We hope that the US Congress will play a supportive role in strengthening Pakistan-US ties and focus on avenues of mutual collaboration that benefit both our peoples and countries,"" she added.","The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution supporting democracy and human rights in Pakistan.

He embraced his father before entering the terminal building with his legal team.Assange has not spoken publicly since being released and did not appear at a Wikileaks press conference at a hotel in Canberra, where Stella said it was too soon to say what her husband would do next.

Those charges stemmed from WikiLeaks' release in 2010 of hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - one of the largest breaches of secret information in US history.During a three-hour hearing held earlier in the US territory of Saipan, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents. He defended his actions, describing himself as a journalist seeking information from sources, a task he said he saw as legal and constitutionally protected. ""I believe the First Amendment and the Espionage Act are in contradiction with each other,"" he said, ""but I accept that it would be difficult to win such a case given all the circumstances.""Asked if Assange would return to publishing, Stella did not rule out the possibility.

Nevada judge denies release of ex-gang leader ahead of trial in 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nevada-judge-denies-release-of-ex-gang-leader-ahead-of-trial-in-1996-killing-of-tupac-shakur/articleshow/111298333.cms,"LAS VEGAS: An ailing former Los Angeles-area gang leader has been denied release from a Las Vegas jail ahead of his trial in the 1996 killing of music legend Tupac Shakur , despite a bid by a hip-hop music figure to underwrite his $750,000 bond.A Nevada judge rejected house arrest with electronic monitoring for Duane ""Keffe D"" Davis, 61, saying she wasn't satisfied with assurances that Davis and his would-be benefactor - Cash ""Wack 100"" Jones - weren't planning to reap profits from the sale of Davis' life story.Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said in a ruling issued Wednesday that Davis failed to prove the money for his bond ""was paid by a legitimate source.""Davis has sought to be released since shortly after his arrest last September made him the only person ever charged with a crime in the killing, which has drawn intense interest and speculation for 27 years.Prosecutors allege the gunfire in Las Vegas that killed Shakur stemmed from competition between East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect and West Coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre known at the time as ""gangsta rap.""Davis has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. His trial is scheduled for Nov. 4. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.After a 45-minute hearing on Tuesday, Kierny said she was left with more questions than answers after Davis' legal team tried to demonstrate the source of the funds. The judge heard contradictory statements from Jones and wasn't convinced the payment he put up to the bond company ""was not connected to Mr. Davis ultimately talking about Mr. Shakur's murder.""Jones, a music record executive who has managed hip-hop artists including Johnathan ""Blueface"" Porter and Jayceon ""The Game"" Taylor, offered sworn testimony Tuesday by video from an unspecified place in California.Jones said he talked with Davis and knew he's having a health issue. He also spoke of his own background coming from gang violence and his exit from that life. He called Davis ""a monumental person in our community. Especially the urban community.""On Tuesday, Davis told the judge he isn't getting proper food and medical care in jail.""I got cancer,"" Davis said as he stood in shackles. ""I'm in a life situation, and I would say anything to save my life.""Prosecutors have argued that Davis intends to benefit from retelling his story about the killing of Shakur and played a recording of a jailhouse phone call in which Jones describes to Davis a plan to produce ""30 to 40 episodes"" of a show based on his life story.""Although it's convoluted, ... it is an illegal benefit, profiting from this crime,"" prosecutor Binu Palal told the judge.Under questioning, Jones testified that he did not yet have a contract or any agreement with Davis for a television or movie deal.","A Nevada judge rejects house arrest with electronic monitoring for Duane ""Keffe D"" Davis.

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

It will commence with actions against terrorists. The operation has no political motive, its sole purpose is to counter the surge in terrorism,” the minister said.“We fought two wars under the Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf regimes for US interests.

The charges related to the disappearances of his followers are still pending trial.He could face at least 12 years in jail, but can still appeal his conviction.Bamjan is believed by many Nepalese to be the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama, who was born in southwestern Nepal some 2,600 years ago and became revered as the Buddha. Buddhist scholars have been skeptical of Bamjan's claims.Bamjan was arrested from a house in a suburb of Kathmandu, the country's capital, after jumping two floors from a window in an attempt to flee.Police said they seized Nepalese banknotes worth $227,000 and other foreign currencies amounting to $23,000 at the time of the arrest.Bamjan became famous in southern Nepal in 2005, when claimed to be able to meditate without moving for months while sitting beneath a tree with no food or water.His popularity has declined amid accusations of sexual and physical assaults on his followers, but he still maintains camps in southern Nepal where thousands come to worship or live.","Ram Bahadur Bamjan is believed by some to be the reincarnation of the founder of Buddhism.

'Broken' voting system

SAFFRON WALDEN: In a medieval market town in rural eastern England, locals are looking to vote tactically at the July 4 general election by taking part in a primary to choose a challenger to the conservatives .Former local councillor John Lodge has been organising an informal ""people's primary"" to pick a candidate to oust Kemi Badenoch, who is vying to be returned as Saffron Walden's MP.The commuter town, part of the North West Essex constituency, has been part of a largely safe Tory seat since before World War II.The primary, however, is a response to ""a really poor government over 14 years"", Lodge said. ""Every day, someone comes up and asks, 'who shall we vote for to get rid of Kemi?'""He directs them to a website where voters can sign up for an online poll on the candidate they like best from the UK's centre and left parties: Labour, Liberal Democrat or Green.""We've got around 400 subscribers to the website,"" Lodge told AFP, as he showed his friend in a vinyl record store how to sign up.The primary subscribers have voted overwhelmingly to back the Labour candidate in the constituency, crowning the candidate the ""people's champion"".Primary organisers are recommending that anti-conservative voters tactically back Labour instead of their usual party, claiming that if 50 percent of Lib Dem voters were to lend their support, the constituency could get rid of Badenoch.Mark Starte, who runs the vinyl store in town, is unconvinced the primary will unite voters enough to succeed but hopes Badenoch will get a ""much smaller majority"" as a result.Right-winger Badenoch is hotly tipped to be a future Tory leader, but with Labour's candidate just over two points behind her in one poll, Lodge hopes tactical voting will secure the town's first non-Tory MP.The UK's winner-take-all electoral system has been criticised for disadvantaging smaller parties, who struggle to win seats despite gaining a chunk of the votes.Voters on the left say it is particularly unfair for them because the left-wing vote is often split across multiple parties.In contrast, the Tories have largely remained the dominant force on the right.The North West Essex primary is part of a network of informal primaries aiming to make the system ""fairer"" for ""progressive"" voters.Simon Oldridge helped organise some seven hustings in South Devon, southwest England, in March, in what he says was the country's ""first community-led political primary"".In it, the public grilled the hopefuls before voting for who to back to defeat the Tory candidate in their constituency.Voting to coalesce behind one candidate rather than guessing who to back tactically, people felt that ""for once their vote was going to count"", said Oldridge.Over 1,000 people voted to back Lib Dem candidate Caroline Voaden.Oldridge said the primary has ""caught people's imagination"", with people putting up banners ""all over the place"" saying they will ""lend their vote"" to Voaden.Since then, however, Labour and the Lib Dems have forbidden their candidates to take part in the primary process.Recent primaries have found ways to side-step candidate involvement by directing interested voters to hustings organised locally and holding secure online votes.The decision was a sign, Oldridge said, that the main parties ""didn't like the loss of control to the electorate, that the electorate are actually starting to make these decisions themselves"".Best for Britain, a campaign group that makes tactical voting suggestions based on nationwide polling, released recommendations for ousting Tory lawmakers in 451 seats last week.""People are fed up,"" said Cal Roscow, the group's director of campaigns, adding that there was a huge appetite for tactical voting.The organisation suggested that more than a third of voters in 621 of the 650 parliament seats said they would vote tactically to change the government.Like the primary organisers, Roscow emphasised that tactical voting was only important because the UK did not have proportional representation.""Best for Britain doesn't like tactical voting. But until we change the voting system, it's going to be something that's part of our general elections,"" he added.""We're trying to improve the way our politics works within our broken first-past-the-post system,"" added Oldridge. ""We're starting something that's potentially going to change politics.""Our message to the parties is: bring proportional representation in, otherwise we're just going to work around this.""","Voters in Saffron Walden, eastern England, are looking to vote tactically at the July 4 general election.

Independence

GLASGOW: In Glasgow , voters at next month's UK general election are poised to desert the Scottish national party and re-establish Labour in its former fiefdom, setting back Scotland 's bruised independence movement .Out shopping on Dumbarton Road in the Partick area of Scotland's biggest city, 26-year-old trainee lawyer Suzie Green said she and her peers planned to cast ballots for Keir Starmer's main opposition party.""Labour really is the only option in Scotland if you want to see change,"" she told AFP.May McCraw, 83, was also excited about the prospect of Labour returning to power in London after 14 years of Conservative rule dominated by austerity, Brexit and infighting.""I've supported them all my days. It's just the way we were brought up,"" she said.Labour ruled the roost in Scotland for decades on the back of strong support among working-class and industrial communities, particularly in the central belt that encompasses Glasgow and the capital, Edinburgh.That changed at the UK election in 2015 when the party was virtually wiped out north of the English border as support soared for the pro-separatist SNP. Scotland sent only one Labour MP to Westminster at the last nationwide vote in 2019.But polls suggest the party could win scores of Scottish seats on July 4 as Labour rides a wave of antipathy towards prime minister Rishi Sunak's ruling Conservatives across the UK.Feelings of disdain among the electorate towards the SNP after 17 years in charge of the devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh is expected to boost Labour's vote share in Scotland.With polls suggesting Labour could overtake the SNP as Scotland's largest party, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar was in a bullish mood when AFP met him on a campaign stop in Midlothian, just outside Edinburgh.""Every vote for Scottish labour is a vote to make sure we get rid of the Tories, to put Scotland at the heart of a Labour government, and to deliver the change our country needs,"" he said.Support for the SNP has slumped amid a finances scandal that saw Peter Murrell, the husband of Scotland's former leader Nicola Sturgeon, accused of embezzlement. Murrell is the party's former chief executive. Sturgeon herself was arrested, but released without charge.Current leader John Swinney only took charge last month following the resignation of Humza Yousaf after the collapse of the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens in Edinburgh. Critics have also accused the SNP of neglecting key issues such as the cost-of-living crisis, education and health.Billy Steele, a 55-year-old Glasgow cafe worker, said he intended to vote SNP because he wants Scotland to be independent. But he would be comfortable with Labour taking most of the six Glasgow seats from the SNP.""I don't have a problem with it if it gives the SNP the kick up the bum they need to focus on day-to-day stuff,"" he said.The SNP won 48 seats in Scotland in 2019. A recent YouGov poll suggested it might only win 18 of Scotland's 57 constituencies this time around, although other polls give it more. ""We know it's all to play for,"" Stephen Flynn, the SNP's leader at Westminster, told AFP, putting a brave face on his party's chances as it launched its manifesto in Edinburgh this month.""What you need to be is confident about your message, and we're very confident about our message under John Swinney's leadership.""Swinney has pledged to start negotiations for another independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats next month, an unlikely prospect.Labour and the Conservatives insist the issue was dealt with at the 2014 referendum, when 55 percent of voters in Scotland opted to remain part of the UK.Despite the SNP's slump, the number of Scots favouring independence has held at around 40 percent, according to surveys, providing the SNP with some comfort.Labour hopes a strong showing in Scotland will propel it towards taking charge in Edinburgh at the next Scottish Parliament elections in 2026 for the first time in two decades, pushing the idea of independence further down the road.A lot will depend on how Labour performs in government, according to Glasgow University politics lecturer Jonathan Parker.""If they provoke some dissatisfaction from Westminster then we could see it (the independence issue) coming back rather sooner,"" he told AFP.",Voters in Scotland are poised to desert the Scottish national party and re- establish Labour in its former fiefdom. Scotland sent only one Labour MP to Westminster at the last nationwide vote in 2019. But polls suggest the party could win scores of Scottish seats on July 4.
