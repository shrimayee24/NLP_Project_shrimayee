THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Four-time Congress MP Shashi Tharoor appears to be growing increasingly disillusioned with the party, following what he perceives as a continued sidelining by the high command. His recent public criticism of a leadership vacuum in Kerala Congress and a meeting with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi to discuss his role in the party have fuelled speculation about his future within the organisation.However, Congress functionaries in Kerala maintained that Tharoor will not quit the party. ""I don't believe Tharoor will leave the party or join CPM,"" KPCC president K Sudhakaran said Sunday. Tharoor has staked a claim for chief ministership if Congress is voted to office in Kerala assembly elections next year. He has asserted that several surveys rank him as the most acceptable functionary among Congress stalwarts in state, signalling his reluctance to remain a passive MP & CWC member.The Thiruvananthapuram MP 's remarks have put the party's state brass in an uncomfortable position. Sudhakaran, who had supported Tharoor, has cautioned him against crossing party lines. ""Responding through the media was not the right approach for Tharoor. He has time to rectify the mistakes he made. It was most unfortunate that he has made comments against the interest of the party through media. One should not cross the boundaries,"" Sudhakaran said.CWC member Ramesh Chennithala defended the party's treatment of Tharoor, pointing out that he had been given multiple opportunities. ""Congress needs Tharoor and that was the reason why he was made MP four times and a central minister once. He was also given important positions in the party's supreme bodies,"" he said.Chennithala recalled how he had invited Tharoor to join Congress when he returned from UN and encouraged him to contest from Palakkad LS constituency. He said Tharoor was given recognition within the party, including invitation to a KPCC general body meeting even when he was not a member.Congress' K Muraleedharan dismissed Tharoor's claims of a leadership vacuum in Kerala.

Bill direct attack on autonomy of legal profession: M K Stalin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-direct-attack-on-autonomy-of-legal-profession-m-k-stalin/articleshow/118513383.cms,"CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin fired yet another salvo at the Union govt on Sunday alleging the Advocates Amendment Bill 2025 was a direct assault on the autonomy of the legal profession .In a social media post on Sunday, Stalin said though the Union govt was forced to withdraw the draft bill due to ‘spontaneous protests and strong opposition,’ there was a rider that the bill will be reconsidered and processed afresh.“This is condemnable. The DMK demands the total withdrawal of this Bill and appeals to the Union govt to respect the autonomy of the legal profession,” Stalin said in the post.Stalin’s attack on Centre comes in the backdrop of a political slugfest between DMK and the BJP-led Union govt over New Education Policy (NEP). Stalin has been alleging that NEP will not be implemented in TN as it imposes Hindi and intrudes into the state's education policy.Scaling up the attack on the BJP, Stalin said the Advocates Amendment Bill was also against Tamil.“The BJP’s aversion to Tamil is evident in this Bill, as it wants to rename the Bar Council of TamilNadu and Puducherry as the Bar Council of Madras. TN is not just a name; it is our identity,” Stalin said.He said the BJP govt has been systematically undermining the independence of the judiciary since 2014 when it came to power. This was done first by trying to hijack judicial appointments through the National Judicial Appointments Commission and then by ignoring the collegium's recommendations for judicial appointments and transfers, he said.“Now, by seeking control over bar councils, it aims to weaken judicial independence ,” he added.Earlier, Stalin said Tamil Nadu is losing out to other states in the delimitation exercise due to population control. Speaking at a marriage function of a DMK functionary here, Stalin said that TN was in a disadvantageous position due to its efficient implementation of population control measures as less population means fewer parliamentary seats in the delimitation exercise. Nevertheless, he urged people to limit the number of their children.He also reiterated that TN will not adopt the three language policy even if it means losing out ₹10,000 crore.",Stalin’s attack on Centre comes in the backdrop of a political slugfest between DMK and the BJP-led Union govt.

Italian Prime Minister GIORGIA MELONI'S Full Speech at CPAC 2025

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has claimed that the Left is panicking over US President Donald Trump ’s victory, accusing liberals of hypocrisy and global conservatives of being unfairly called a “threat to democracy.”Speaking via videolink at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington DC on Saturday, Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.The Italian PM argued that the Left’s frustration had turned into “hysteria” following Trump’s return to power, not only because conservatives were winning elections but because they were now working together internationally. “When Bill Clinton and Tony Blair created the global leftist liberal network in the 90s, they were called statesmen,” she said.“Today, when Trump, Meloni, Milei or maybe Modi talk, they are called a threat to democracy. This is the last double standard, but we are used to it, and the good news is people no longer believe in their lies, despite all the mud they throw at us. Citizens keep voting for us,"" she added.Meloni backed Trump as a strong leader, dismissing any suggestion that his presidency would create rifts within the conservative movement . “Our adversaries hope that President Trump will move away from us, but knowing him as a strong and effective leader I bet that those who hope for divisions will be proven wrong,” she said.Meloni also defended JD Vance, who faced criticism for his speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he said Europe’s greatest threat came “from within.” Meloni dismissed the backlash, claiming liberal elites were uncomfortable with conservatives speaking openly about identity and democracy. “Vice President Vance was discussing something deeper: identity, democracy, freedom of speech,” she said.Meloni’s participation in CPAC came amid calls from Italian opposition leaders to cancel her appearance. The controversy followed former Trump advisor Steve Bannon’s speech at the event, during which he appeared to make a Nazi-style salute. Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein condemned CPAC as a “neo-fascist gathering” and urged Meloni to disassociate from it. However, Meloni went ahead with her speech, aligning herself with the conservative movement and dismissing left-wing criticism.She reiterated her belief in a conservative vision of leadership and said that, “We serve the people, we do not rule over them.”","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said that Elon Musk will be looking at gold depository at Fort Knox ""to make sure the gold is still there"".The United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox has served as the storage facility for the country's precious metal bullion reserves since 1937, earning a reputation for its robust security.""We're going to open up the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,"" Trump said in a speech to Republican governors Thursday evening.""I don't want to open it and the cupboards are bare,"" he added.In addition to safeguarding the gold, Fort Knox also functions as the Army's human resources command center and hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.The Army post, located about 35 miles south of Louisville, covers 109,000 acres across three Kentucky counties—Bullitt, Hardin, and Mead.Established during World War I, Camp Knox was initially an artillery training center. It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known as Fort Knox ever since. In 1937, the first shipment of gold arrived at Fort Knox, with the 1st Cavalry Regiment assigned to guard it.When World War II broke out in Europe, the Army formed the Armored Force at Fort Knox, where thousands of soldiers were introduced to tank training.

Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, he said, ""Looks like the conservative party in Germany has won the very big and highly anticipated election. Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration, that has prevailed for so many years.

Rise of AfD



AfD unlikely to be part of the ruling coalition



Germany’s elections on Sunday saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secure its highest-ever vote share, finishing second with over 20 per cent. The conservative CDU/CSU alliance , led by Friedrich Merz, won the most votes with more than 28 per cent. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) recorded their worst postwar result at just over 16 per cent.The AfD’s rise comes amid growing concerns over immigration and security following recent attacks linked to asylum seekers.The party, which first entered the Bundestag (Germany's Parliament) in 2017 with 12.6 per cent, nearly doubled its vote share. AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla called the outcome ""historic,"" while the party’s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, said AfD is ""open for coalition negotiations."" AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla called the outcome ""historic,"" while the party’s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, said AfD is ""open for coalition negotiations.""However, mainstream parties, including Merz’s CDU/CSU, have ruled out working with AfD.

""You want the opposite of what we want, so there will be no cooperation.""Scholz also opposed AfD’s rise, saying, ""That must never be something that we will accept. I will not accept it and never will.""The election was held earlier than planned after Scholz’s coalition government collapsed in November last year. The campaign focused on concerns about Germany’s economy and migration policies.Merz, a longtime critic of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, has pushed for stricter immigration policies. He has called for a swift formation of a new government, citing global changes under US President Donald Trump. ""The world out there isn’t waiting for us, and it isn’t waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations,"" he said.The SPD’s coalition partners also struggled. The Greens received around 12 per cent, while the Free Democrats (FDP) were projected to fall below the 5 per cent threshold needed to retain seats. The newly formed Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) hovered around this threshold, while the hard-left Left Party strengthened its position with up to 9 per cent.CDU/CSU is a centre-right Christian democratic and conservative political alliance of two political parties in Germany - the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria.Merz aims to form a government by Easter, but coalition negotiations are expected to be challenging. He may seek to partner with the SPD and Greens. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens suggested that Merz should ""moderate his tone"" after the campaign.“We have seen the center is weakened overall, and everyone should look at themselves and ask whether they didn't contribute to that,” said Habeck. “Now he must see that he acts like a chancellor.”More than 59 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which will determine the composition of the 630-seat Bundestag. The next government will play a key role in shaping Germany’s economic and foreign policies, including its position on Ukraine and relations with the US under Trump’s leadership.","Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secure its highest-ever vote share, finishing second with over 20 per cent.

'Adult in the room'

Anti-immigration stance

AfD 'firmly anchored' in German politics

Nazi grandfather

Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) leader Alice Weidel is a striking contrast to the party she represents. A gay woman raising two sons with her Sri Lankan-born partner, she leads a party that opposes same-sex marriage and champions 'traditional family values'.Weidel’s leadership has coincided with a rise in support for the AfD, making it Germany’s most successful far-right party since World War II. In the national elections, the party secured over 20% of the vote, finishing second only to Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance on Sunday.Weidel was born in Gütersloh, West Germany. She studied business and economics before working at Goldman Sachs and later the Bank of China. She spent six years in China, where she earned a doctorate and became fluent in Mandarin. Unlike many in her party, she is from the West, while the AfD draws most of its strength from the former East Germany.Weidel’s career path sets her apart from the party’s typical membership, but analysts say her business-like image helps the AfD appeal to middle-class voters. “She seems like the adult in the room among all these lunatics and extremists,” Oliver Lembcke, a political scientist at the University of Bochum, was quoted as saying to Reuters news agency.Weidel has fully embraced the AfD’s nationalist and anti-immigration stance. She originally joined the party due to its opposition to eurozone bailouts but later shifted her focus towards migration and German identity politics.She has described immigrants as “burqas, girls in headscarves, knife-wielding men on government benefits and other good-for-nothing people,” reports Reuters.Her statements faced widespread criticism but struck a chord with the party’s supporters. At a conference earlier this year, she called for the “large-scale repatriation of foreigners,” emphasising each syllable: “re-mi-gra-tion,” as the crowd cheered.Weidel has also questioned climate change, expressed scepticism about Covid vaccines, and endorsed the far-right “Great Replacement” theory, which claims that elites are deliberately replacing native populations with immigrants, often targeting white Europeans.In an online discussion with billionaire Elon Musk, she claimed that the Nazis were “not right-wing” and described Hitler as “a communist, socialist guy,"" reports Sky news.At an AfD rally on Sunday, Weidel said that the party was now “firmly anchored” in Germany’s political system after securing second place in national elections. She also warned mainstream parties that if they refused to cooperate with the AfD, “we will surpass them in the next election.”Despite her personal life clashing with the party’s conservative ideals, Weidel has avoided focusing on her identity. She has dismissed same-sex marriage as unimportant and refuses to label herself as queer. She claims that the AfD is the only party willing to address hostility towards gay people from Muslim immigrants.Weidel’s family history has come under scrutiny. Her grandfather, Hans Weidel, was a Nazi judge appointed by Adolf Hitler, something she says she only discovered through researchers, German newspaper Die Welt reported. Despite this, she continues to push for stricter immigration laws and a referendum on EU membership.Weidel sees former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her role model. She wants Germany to hold a Brexit-style referendum on EU membership if the bloc cannot reform what she calls its ""democratic deficit.""",Alice Weidel is the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) She is a gay woman raising two sons with her Sri Lankan-born partner.

'Bitter' blow for

Olaf Scholz

Merz’s coalition challenge

Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has secured its strongest-ever result in a national election, surging to second place with over 20%, trailing only behind Friedrich Merz ’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance , which won with more than 28%.The party nearly doubled its support, making it the most successful far-right party since World War II, according to projections from ARD and ZDF public television.AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla called the result a landmark victory, telling supporters: “We have achieved something historic today.” At the party’s election night gathering in Berlin, attendees waved German flags as Alice Weidel, the party leader and candidate for chancellor, insisted AfD was now “firmly anchored” in Germany’s political system.Weidel also issued a challenge to the mainstream parties, arguing that if the CDU/CSU refused to cooperate with the AfD to “implement the will of the people,” her party would surpass them in the next election. The party has been buoyed by backing from influential figures abroad, including US vice president JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk, both of whom have become key figures in US President Donald Trump’s administration.While AfD celebrated, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats (SPD) suffered a crushing defeat, finishing in third place with just over 16% of the vote—its worst postwar result. Conceding defeat, Scholz admitted to his supporters: “This is a bitter election result. This is an election defeat.”Scholz congratulated the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, led by Friedrich Merz, which won with around 28.5% of the vote. However, he reaffirmed his stance against working with AfD, stating, “That must never be something that we will accept. I will not accept it and never will.”Merz now faces a tough challenge in forming a coalition, despite his party winning the most votes. He promised to “re-establish a viable government in Germany as quickly as possible,” but the divided political landscape makes that difficult. The Greens, with around 12%, and the hard-left Left Party, which made a surprise comeback with up to 9%, could play key roles in talks.Despite its big win, the AfD remains shut out. Merz has ruled out working with them, saying, “We have fundamentally different views, for example, on foreign policy, on security policy, in many other areas, regarding Europe, the euro, NATO.”","Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secures its strongest-ever result in a national election.

Coalition push

AfD’s rise

Trump’s influence on the election

Outgoing German chancellor Olaf Scholz ’s Social Democrats (SPD) was defeated in Germany’s national elections, recording their worst postwar result with just 16% of the vote.Friedrich Merz ’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance secured victory with over 28%, positioning him as the next chancellor. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged to second place with more than 20%, marking its strongest performance in history.Scholz has decried historic gains by the AfD. He told followers that “this is a bitter election result” for his center-left Social Democrats and “this is an election defeat.” Scholz said that he ""bears responsibility"" for the result while congratulating the CDU/CSU for forming the upcoming government. Furthermore, he reiterated his stance against the AfD, stating no cooperation will be done with the far-right party.Merz, 69, promised to form a new government by Easter, saying global events—like Donald Trump ’s return to the White House—made quick action necessary. “The world isn’t waiting for us,” he said, urging Europe to boost its defence. He also said Germany should rely less on the US, especially with Trump warming up to Russia.It’s unclear how Merz will form a government. He could partner with the SPD without Scholz or work with the Greens, who got 12% of the vote. However, his Bavarian allies, the CSU, are hesitant about this. The pro-business FDP, which helped bring down Scholz’s government last year, barely passed the 5% mark needed to stay in parliament. Meanwhile, the left-wing BSW was just below the threshold, making coalition talks even trickier.AfD nearly doubled its support from the last election, driven by concerns over immigration and security following a series of deadly attacks linked to asylum seekers. The party’s co-leader Alice Weidel celebrated the “historic” result and reiterated her willingness to govern with the CDU/CSU. However, Merz and other mainstream parties have maintained a strict “firewall” against working with AfD.AfD’s rise has alarmed many across Germany. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called the result “deeply concerning,” warning that a party with ideological links to far-right extremism now holds significant power.Donald Trump, now in his second term and reshaping US foreign policy, called the result a “great day for Germany” on Truth Social. Trump's allies Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have openly supported AfD. Trump’s outreach to Vladimir Putin and his Nato comments have added to Europe’s concerns.Merz recognised these challenges and urged European unity. “We are under massive pressure from both Washington and Moscow,” he said. “Our absolute priority must be to strengthen Europe’s independence.”Furthermore, Merz faces the challenge of balancing coalition negotiations while addressing voter concerns over migration and the economy. Political analyst Michael Broening warned that mainstream parties must act decisively: “If they fail to deliver this time, they may not be the establishment for much longer.”","Outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz ’s Social Democrats (SPD) was defeated in Germany’s national elections.

US President Donald Trump's administration announced on Sunday the elimination of 2,000 positions at the US agency for international development (USAID) and placed most remaining employees on administrative leave globally. The move follows a federal court ruling that allowed the administration to proceed with pulling thousands of USAID staffers from their jobs both in the United States and abroad.US district judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas to extend a temporary stay on the government's plan in a lawsuit filed by USAID employees, effectively greenlighting the administration's decision. The official notices, reviewed by The Associated Press, instructed staff that as of 11:59 pm EST on Sunday, all direct hire personnel, except for those handling mission-critical functions, core leadership roles, or specially designated programs, would be placed on administrative leave.This latest action is part of a broader effort by the administration to scale back USAID operations, a campaign that has already led to the closure of its headquarters in Washington and the shutdown of thousands of aid and development initiatives worldwide.President Donald Trump and his cost-cutting chief, Elon Musk, have repeatedly criticised foreign aid programs, claiming they are wasteful and aligned with a liberal agenda.In addition to the job cuts and administrative leave orders, hundreds of USAID contractors reportedly received anonymous form letters of termination over the weekend. According to copies of the letters obtained by AP, the lack of specific names or job details could complicate efforts for affected workers to claim unemployment benefits.While the administration moves ahead with its restructuring of USAID, a separate federal lawsuit challenging the freeze on foreign assistance has seen a different judge issue a temporary order blocking the withholding of funds. The court ruled last week that the administration must restore at least some of the aid funding to global programs.The Trump administration's aggressive overhaul of USAID has drawn sharp criticism from international aid organisations and lawmakers, who warn that the abrupt withdrawal of funding and personnel could have devastating effects on global humanitarian efforts .","US President Donald Trump's administration announced the elimination of 2,000 positions at the US agency for international development (USAID) The move follows a federal court ruling that allowed the administration to proceed with pulling thousands of USAID staffers from their jobs both in the United States and abroad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118513297,imgsize-823125,width-400,resizemode-4/118513297.jpg"

A lip reader caught Princess of Wales , Kate Middleton , making a playful remark during Prince William 's passing out parade .At the December 2006 ceremony, which marked the formal graduation of officer cadets, Kate attended as William's girlfriend alongside numerous guests. William had finished his 44-week Commissioning Course at Sandhurst and was preparing to join the Household Cavalry's Blues and Royals as a second lieutenant, UK Mirror reported.Prince Harry completed his passing out parade in April 2006.

The 24-year-old Kate wore a scarlet coat with black accessories.William, also 24, participated in the parade with 232 fellow cadets. This marked Kate's first official public appearance at a Royal Family event. According to Tina Brown's book The Palace Papers, whilst Kate's presence signalled strong commitment, her mother attracted criticism for chewing nicotine gum throughout the ceremony.Following the event, Catherine and her parents shared their first lunch with the Royal Family.

She told the Mirror: ""We have already seen more of her than we expected in these early months of the year, so that augurs well.But I think she will be determined to remain in charge of her own schedule and she will dictate how much we see her on public duty, and how quickly she gets back to full-time work.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

JD Vance steps in to help 12-year-old relative denied heart transplant over unvaccinated status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-steps-in-to-help-12-year-old-relative-denied-heart-transplant-over-unvaccinated-status/articleshow/118506731.cms,"US Vice President JD Vance and his 12-year-old distant relative Adaline Deal (File Image)

US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in his 12-year-old distant relative medical case and is looking into ways to help out her as she was refused a heart transplant in Ohio due to her unvaccinated status against COVID-19 and influenza.Adaline Deal , adopted from China at age four, was born with two rare cardiac conditions: Ebstein's anomaly and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome.Vance informed the Daily Mail about his recent awareness of Adaline's situation, stating: ""I guess it's been circulating on social media, but I was made aware of a couple days ago, and we're trying to dig in and trying to help, obviously, as much as possible.""The familial connection exists through Adaline's adoptive brother Jacob Deal, who is married to Vance's half-sister, Chelsea.Her heart condition deteriorated as she grew, leading to heart failure in January. Her mother, Jeneen Deal, expressed gratitude for Vance's support and hopes the Trump administration will advocate for legislation protecting unvaccinated individuals from hospital discrimination .Cincinnati Children's Hospital , where Adaline received treatment for nearly ten years, requires transplant patients to be vaccinated due to the necessity of immunosuppressant drugs post-surgery.The family, identifying as nondenominational Christians, declines vaccination based on religious convictions. Jeneen Deal explained: ""We're just in a different way. [We] walked with the Lord. The Holy Spirit is on us. We weren't like that – we didn't have a relationship with the Lord like we do now, so it's different.""Although Adaline received vaccinations in China and during adoption, she hasn't been immunised since. While one transplant team doctor approved her surgery despite vaccination status, unanimous approval from the entire team is required.The situation has prompted legislative action, with Representatives Erin Houchin and Mike Rulli introducing the COVID-19 Vaccination Non-Discrimination Act on February 14. The bill aims to prevent transplant denials based on personal or religious medical choices.Houchin stated: ""Denying a child a life-saving transplant over a COVID-19 vaccine is not science, it's cruelty. Hospitals exist to save lives, not impose medical mandates on vulnerable patients. Families deserve the freedom to make the best medical decisions for their loved ones, without fear of being blacklisted from life-saving care. This bill will put an end to this unjust practice.""",US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in his 12-year-old distant relative's medical case.

Zelenskyy says 'willing to resign as president in exchange for Ukraine's Nato membership',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/zelenskyy-says-willing-to-resign-as-president-in-exchange-for-ukraines-nato-membership/articleshow/118508379.cms,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is ready to resign as Ukraine’s president in exchange for Nato membership, declaring he would step down “immediately” if it guaranteed the country’s security. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said, “If there is peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready. I can exchange it for Nato.”His comments come as Ukraine marks the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion and faces growing pressure over negotiations with the United States.Speaking about Trump calling a 'dictator' Zelenskyy said that only a true authoritarian would be offended it. Zelenskyy added that as a legally elected leader, he was not offended, noting, ""One would be offended by the word dictator if he was a dictator. I’m not.""Zelensky also expressed the desire for a meeting with Trump to discuss an agreement granting Washington access to Ukrainian natural resources before Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He stressed the importance of Trump providing security guarantees to help Ukraine defend itself from the Russian invasion.Zelenskyy’s remarks follow mounting tensions with the US over a proposed mineral resources deal. Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff suggested on Sunday that Ukraine could sign the agreement with Washington this week as part of efforts to end the war. “I expect to see a deal signed this week,” Witkoff told CNN, adding that Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to move forward with the agreement. However, a source close to the negotiations told AFP that Ukraine was “not ready” to accept the current terms, insisting that security guarantees must be included.The proposed deal has become a major sticking point in relations between Kyiv and Washington, with Trump demanding Ukraine provide rare earth minerals and oil as compensation for US aid. The president told supporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), “I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up. We’re asking for rare earth and oil, anything we can get.” Trump has claimed that the US aid to Ukraine exceeds $500 billion, though official figures put the total at around $60 billion.A deepening war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy has raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Trump recently branded the Ukrainian leader a “dictator” and urged him to “move fast” to end the war. The tensions escalated after US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian representatives. Meanwhile, Washington has proposed a United Nations resolution on the Ukraine conflict that notably excludes references to Russian-occupied territories.Ukraine has resisted Trump’s demands, with reports describing the proposed agreement as one-sided. “There are no American obligations in the agreement regarding guarantees or investments. Everything about them is very vague, and they want to extract $500 billion from us,” a Ukrainian official told AFP. Kyiv has reportedly pushed for amendments to secure clearer commitments.Despite the tensions, discussions over the deal remain ongoing. Trump’s special envoy Keith Kellogg, who met Zelenskyy in Kyiv, described the talks as “critical” and suggested the Ukrainian president understood the importance of reaching an agreement. However, Kyiv remains firm in seeking security assurances as a condition for any deal.",Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is ready to resign as Ukraine's president in exchange for Nato membership.

Following a January 24 visit to disaster-affected areas in North Carolina and California, she hadn't returned until Saturday.The first lady was anticipated to divide her time between New York, where Barron attends university, and Florida. Sources close to her indicated she would attend significant events like Saturday's ball and maintain her own agenda as first lady.Her month-long absence suggests an even more limited presence in Washington than initially expected, marking an unprecedented arrangement for a first family.

She hasn't undertaken any solo official travel, contrasting with her previous term's activities.Sources indicate she prefers to avoid public involvement in her husband's second term's daily operations, though she remains an influential adviser.

Who is Janet Mills?



What it was like when Mills had spate with Trump?



After Janet Mills , the Democratic governor of Maine challenged President Trump during a White House meeting over banning men from women's sports, her video of performing at a Halloween drag show resurfaced.A footage reportedly from October 29, 2022, the Democratic governor of Maine was seen performing at a Halloween drag show at the Pumpkin Bal in Portland, Maine.In the video Mills is seen enjoying the Maine’s largest LGBTQ+ Halloween dance party.This video came after Mills, 77, told Trump on Friday that she would not accede to his executive order banning transgender athletes in women’s sports. “See you in court,” she said, while seated with a group of bipartisan governors in the White House State Dining Room.Born in Farmington, Maine grew up surrounded by politics. Her father, Sumner Peter Mills Jr, worked as a lawyer and served as a Republican state legislator, later becoming U.S. attorney for Maine during the Eisenhower and Nixon governments.Following her education at the University of Massachusetts and the University of Maine School of Law, she pioneered as Maine's first female criminal prosecutor in the attorney general's office. In a 1978 interview, she said, ""I like prosecuting murder trials the best.""She achieved another milestone as the first woman in New England to secure a district attorney position, advocating for improved handling of domestic violence cases within the justice system. She won a State Legislature seat in 2002, and by 2009, she had become Maine's first female attorney general, New York Times reported.During her tenure as Maine's chief prosecutor, she opposed Paul LePage, the conservative governor and Trump supporter. When LePage vetoed a bill expanding police access to opioid overdose medication, she allocated settlement funds for treatment. She opposed LePage's support of Trump's 2017 immigration ban on predominantly Muslim countries, legally challenging the executive order. LePage's lawsuit against her proved unsuccessful.In 2019, after LePage reached his term limit, she won the gubernatorial election.Her administration has prioritised economic initiatives and healthcare access expansion. She has collaborated with lawmakers to protect transgender individuals from insurance discrimination, authorise gender-affirming hormone therapy for those aged 16 and above under specific conditions, and establish legal protection for gender transition care providers against interstate litigation.Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis expressed disappointment over Friday's heated exchange between Maine's Democratic Governor and President Trump at a White House gathering, noting it failed to meet the National Governors Association's standard of constructive disagreement, New York Post reported.Polis told Fox News that whilst disagreements are expected, the interaction did not exemplify the desired approach of elevating discourse towards finding common solutions.During the meeting, Trump warned of potential federal funding cuts for states not complying with his directive prohibiting transgender athletes in women's sports, specifically mentioning Maine. This prompted Governor Janet Mills to declare ""See you in court,"" to which Trump replied, ""I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.""Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt described the atmosphere as ""a little uncomfortable"" when speaking to Fox News about the confrontation between Trump and Mills regarding her state's stance on the president's executive order about school sports.Stitt admitted to being unaware of the complete background of their dispute, noting there appeared to be previous exchanges between both parties. He acknowledged governors' rights to pursue legal action against the federal government, suggesting the confrontation might benefit both leaders' political standings.Stitt commented on the broader context, mentioning the NCAA and Olympics' positions on the matter, whilst questioning the legal basis of Maine's opposition to the directive, adding that the courts would ultimately decide the outcome.During the same White House session, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey requested direct contact information for cabinet officials to enhance state-federal cooperation under Trump's administration.","Janet Mills, 77, is the Democratic governor of Maine.

Mass deportations intensify

Undocumented population in the US

US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his administration’s mass deportation efforts, framing them as a necessary step to rid the country of fraudsters, cheaters, and bureaucrats working against American interests.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington, Trump reinforced his hardline immigration stance, calling the deportations part of a broader mission to clean up the system.“The fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists, and deep state bureaucrats are being sent packing,” Trump declared. “Illegal alien criminals are being sent home. We're draining the swamp and restoring government by the people.”Since returning to office, Trump has pushed forward an aggressive immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that as of February 3, federal agents had arrested 8,768 individuals as part of the administration’s mass deportation campaign.Among those deported, 332 Indian nationals have already been sent back in three separate batches. Additionally, a group of deported Indians recently landed in Panama after President Jose Raul Mulino agreed to make his country a “bridge” for deportees.According to a 2022 Pew Research Center report, unauthorized immigrants made up 3.3% of the total US population and 23% of the foreign-born population. Trump’s policies aim to significantly reduce these numbers through large-scale removals.Trump has vowed to continue and expand the crackdown, making immigration enforcement a cornerstone of his administration. While his policies have drawn sharp criticism from human rights groups, they remain a rallying point for his conservative base.","US President Donald Trump defended his administration’s mass deportation efforts, framing them as a necessary step to rid the country of fraudsters, cheaters, and bureaucrats.

In an interview with Lara Trump, Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, who returned to Fox News with her new show, Karoline spoke about how she became a mother during the campaign and bounced back to work and is now juggling the roles.As Lara asked her to give some advice to those who aspire to be like her, Karolin said if you are a Conservative voice on the campus, then you are definitely in the minority but that should not dissuade you from speaking the truth.Even if it's against the professors, which Karoline said she did a lot in her college asking youngsters to raise their voice. ""Seize every opportunity. Even if it's an unpaid opportunity with long hours, just do it, it will lead you to the next opportunity in life.""""And thirdly, remember someday your intern could possibly be your boss. So never burn bridges and leave everybody with a good impression.""Leavitt said President Trump is a good listener and values every opinion which is fascinating to her though this means long working hours for her. ""He's so generous with his time, I have noticed. And sometimes that means we are running late. Here in the White House, Trump time is a real thing,"" Leavitt said.Talking about juggling her roles as a mom and as the White House press secretary, Leavitt said that she has a new perspective after becoming a mother. ""I want my son to grow up in a free America that we've studied and learnt about in our classrooms and not this hatred.""""I try to tell myself when there are long hours and even nights and days away from my son, campaigning with the president and now working with the White House, that this is temporary and once-in-a-lifetime and we are doing real work. You just do your best, don't really sleep much and and get up the next day and do the best,"" Leavitt said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke to Lara Trump on Fox News.

Who is Joy Reid?



MSNBC made a major overhaul after Rebecca Jutler became the new president of the network following Donald Trump's election win. Liberal Joy Reid is a known critic of Trump and her 7 pm show has been running for the past five years. Now the network decided to replace the program by a new panel show featuring co-hosts Alicia Menendez, Michael Steele and Symone Sanders Townsend.New York Times reported that the final episode of Reid'ss show ""The Reidout"" will air sometime this week.The shakeup comes amid the plummeting rating of the network, the NYT said. MSNBC outperformed CNN but lagged behind Fox News, it said. ""Other major changes are expected at MSNBC. In January, Rachel Maddow, the network’s best-known anchor, returned to hosting her 9 p.m. show five days a week during the first 100 days of the Trump administration after having scaled back to only Mondays. At the time, the network said that Alex Wagner, who had hosted the 9 p.m. show four days a week, would return at the end of April,"" the report said.""That is no longer the case. Instead, MSNBC is planning to appoint a new anchor to fill Ms. Wagner’s spot, the two people said. A likely candidate for that hour is Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary in the Biden administration, who hosts shows on Sunday at noon and 8 p.m. on Mondays, the people said, though adding that this decision hadn’t been finalized,"" it said.56-year-old Joy Reid is a political commentator, television host and writer.

Fracture: Barack Obama, the Clintons, and the Racial Divide (2016), The Man Who Sold America: Trump and the Unraveling of the American Story (2019), and Medgar and Myrlie: Medgar Evers and the Love Story That Awakened America (2024).","MSNBC made a major overhaul after Rebecca Jutler became the new president of the network following Donald Trump's election win.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

'Airport built for China, not locals'

No direct flight to Quetta or Islamabad

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others. Last month, dozens of fighters of the separatist outfit wrested control of a small town in Khuzdar from paramilitary forces. Pakistani authorities regained the town after hours of effort.The separatists accuse Pakistan’s federal govt and military authorities of exploiting the natural resources of mineral-rich Balochistan for development elsewhere in the country, while neglecting the local population. The province has been the site of an insurgency for the last two decades, with separatists frequently attacking police, security forces, and civilians they see as “outsiders” in the region.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range. With 45 passengers on board, the bus was en route to Faisalabad from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital.A senior government official said the attackers burst the tyres of the bus on a highway close to the provincial border with Punjab. “Armed men stopped a Punjab-bound bus, with 45 people on board, on the Balochistan-Punjab highway and off-boarded seven Punjabi passengers after checking identification cards of those on board the bus,” Khadim Hussain, Barkhan’s assistant commissioner, said. “The commuters were lined up and shot dead,” Hussain said, adding the attack was carried out within 10 minutes and the attackers escaped into the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountains.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ethnic Baloch separatists, who have carried out similar attacks in the past, are the most likely suspects. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) is the most active organisation in the region and it usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.At least 10 mine workers from northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were killed in a roadside blast in Balochistan’s Harnai district. Last year, at least 39 people were killed after BLA militants forcibly removed ethnic Punjabi commuters from buses in the volatile province.
