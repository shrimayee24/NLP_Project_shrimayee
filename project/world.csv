"After Tirupati row, Odisha to check Puri temple ghee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-tirupati-row-odisha-to-check-puri-temple-ghee/articleshow/113648824.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: Amid the controversy surrounding the alleged presence of animal fat in the ghee used to prepare Tirupati laddus , the Odisha govt has decided to send the ghee used in Puri Jagannath Temple for quality test .Puri district collector Sidharth Shankar Swain Tuesday said the move was aimed at preventing adulteration in the offerings to the deities at the 12th century shrine.The decision comes a day after a Puri-based lawyer, Dilip Baral, submitted a plea to the collector, who is also the deputy chief administrator of Jagannath temple administration, suggesting a proper check on the quality of ingredients, including ghee, used for preparation of ' mahaprasad ' in the temple kitchen.Swain said although no complaint had been received regarding the quality of ghee, the administration decided to get it examined in the backdrop of the Tirupati laddu controversy.Govt-owned Odisha State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (Omfed) has been supplying ghee to the temple for the last few years. According to sources in the Suar Mahasua Nijog, an association of servitors who prepare the 'mahaprasad' daily, about 6,000 litres of ghee is purchased from Omfed every month at nearly Rs 700 per litre.Swain said the food safety and quality control authorities had already been informed to carry out the inspection of the ghee and other raw materials used in the shrine kitchen.As of now, a variety of items such as rice, khichdi, dal, dalma, curry and sweets are cooked daily for about 25,000 devotees, and served as 'mahaprasad'. ""We will also check the quality of the ghee used for lighting diyas. In 2017, the temple administration had made it mandatory for vendors to sell ghee supplied by Omfed, following allegations of adulterated ghee of other companies being sold to the shrine. We will check if the vendors are using Omfed ghee or not. Strict action will be taken if any violations come to our notice,"" Swain said.",Puri district collector Sidharth Shankar Swain said the move was aimed at preventing adulteration in the offerings to the deities at the 12th century shrine.

PM Modi heads back to India without handing MAGA supremo a 'trump card',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pm-modi-heads-back-to-india-without-handing-maga-supremo-a-trump-card/articleshow/113617300.cms,"'Who's Next?': Awkward Moment For Biden As He Forgets Modi’s Name At Quad Summit | Watch

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi headed back home to India on Monday night after a hectic 72-hour visit to the US during which he steered clear of domestic American politics, including giving a wide berth to the two 2024 Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris Modi's packed schedule, which included bilateral talks with outgoing President Joe Biden , a summit of Quad leaders , an address at the UN Summit of the Future, a community reception, and meeting with high-profile CEOs, left him little time to meet the candidates, both of whom have also been on the road electioneering.But a Trump teaser last week that Modi was coming to the US to meet him had triggered speculation about whether the MAGA supremo would turn up in NYC or at the diaspora event at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, where Trump himself had held a raucous rally a few days before.As it turned out, it was just some hot air from the MAGA poohbah, whose bloviating in recent months includes constant bragging about how world leaders respect him and seek him out. Apparently, some polite inquiries about his schedule from someone who desired to bring about a meeting may have been enough to assume Modi wanted a meeting.Trump is notorious for misreading or distorting conversations with world leaders. In a 2019 Oval Office meeting with then Pakistan PM Imran Khan, he claimed Modi had asked him to be a mediator or arbitrator in Kashmir, a claim New Delhi had to refute publicly.Despite the contretemps, or perhaps because of it, the Indian Prime Minister famously invited Trump for a ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Houston in 2019, impressing him with a 50,000 people desi turnout. That in turn led Trump, who is freakily obsessed with crowd sizes, to begin his 2020 India visit with a ""Namaste Trump"" rally Modi hosted for him in Ahmedabad, where 100,000 people packed the newly build stadium named after Modi.While Trump talked up Modi ahead of his US visit on Friday, calling him a ""fantastic"" leader while holding out the prospect of a meeting, the Indian side evidently chose discretion after copping some criticism for the 2019 rally in which Modi laid it thick on Trump. He echoed the slogan ""Ab ki baar, Trump sarkar"" -- coined by Trump's Indian-American acolytes who see common virtues in them as strong, assertive leaders -- leading some commentators to conclude he was backing Trump for a second consecutive term in 2020.As it turned out, Trump lost the election to Joe Biden, and New Delhi had to reset engagement with the incoming Democratic dispensation that included a vice-president of part-Indian origin, whose desi creds are suspect in the eyes of the Indian right wing. In light of that experience, it appears the PM's brains trust chose to skirt around meeting either presidential candidate, with everyone's program busy enough to cite ""scheduling difficulties.""Although Indian-Americans have conventionally leaned towards Democrats, more recent surveys indicate that with increasing economic security and well-being, many are embracing the Republican Party. Trump in particular has a vocal Indian-American following from a pro-Modi constituency that hero-worships both.Trump was in fact speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night as Modi emplaned for New Delhi. Harris, who also has to juggle her job as vice-president while campaigning, was in Washington DC before she heads out to Pennsylvania, the most crucial among battleground states.","Narendra Modi headed back home to India on Monday night after a hectic 72-hour visit to the US.

THANE: Bombay high court will urgently hear on Wednesday a petition by the father of the accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case who was killed in a police encounter on Monday evening while being escorted by Thane crime branch officers, even as the post-mortem found a single bullet mark on the left side of the 24-year-old's head and listed the cause of death as 'haemorrhagic shock' and 'bleeding'.Based on the account of the escorting team, Mumbra police registered two cases: an accidental death report and another of attempted murder against the deceased. Both will be handed over to CID, Maharashtra, on Wednesday.Forensic teams inspected the PCR van and visited the scene near the Mumbra bypass. They collected blood samples and recovered four shell casings. In his plea before the HC, an advocate for the deceased's father sought urgent hearing saying evidence could be destroyed.The former school janitor accused of sexually assaulting two nursery students had turned abusive and aggressive and threatened to kill the cops when he was being taken from Taloja jail to the Thane crime branch office. The central unit of Thane crime branch had taken his custody in an offence related to unnatural sex filed by his wife for probe. When assistant inspector Nilesh More alerted senior inspector Sanjay Shinde, he stopped near Mumbra and moved the accused to the rear seat in an attempt to de-escalate the situation. But the accused suddenly began shouting, ""Why are you taking me back? What have I done now? Let me go."" He snatched a gun and fired at them before being killed in retaliatory firing.Medical sources said a five-doctor team conducting the post-mortem at J J Hospital asked for a full-body X-ray to check for foreign bodies, but none was found. It is learned they collected samples after doing a saline handwash, mainly to check for residue. Authorities said the post-mortem was videographed and the body was handed over to Mumbra police around 5pm. Samples have been sent for forensic testing.Around 6.15pm on Monday near the Mumbra bypass, as the accused was being transferred from Taloja Central Jail to the Thane crime branch under transit remand, he became increasingly aggressive, said statements made to the police.Shinde in his statement (accessed by TOI) said the police team, comprising himself, API Nilesh More, and two constables, had taken custody of the accused at 5.30pm.

The two other officers involved are said to be under significant stress following the incident but are taking treatment at a private hospital.Relatives of the deceased accused, who were initially refusing to accept the body, were seen ready to take it from the hospital. The deceased's uncle told TOI that his relatives will reach the city by night and they would perform his last rites on Wednesday.Police sources said in light of public anger against the deceased, they will request his family to perform his last rites at night.

Zelenskyy at the United Nations

On Tuesday, Donald Trump commended Russia 's military history while criticizing US aid to Ukraine, asserting that he would swiftly end the war if elected president. Speaking in Savannah, Georgia, Trump ridiculed President Joe Biden 's pledge to support Ukraine until victory, citing Russia's past successes against Hitler's Nazi regime in World War II and Napoleon Bonaparte's failed invasion.Trump insisted on the US ""getting out"" of the conflict, though he did not provide specifics on how he would negotiate an end to US involvement. He mimicked Biden's statement, ""We will not leave until we win,"" and questioned the outcome if Ukraine were to emerge victorious, emphasizing Russia's reputation for engaging in wars.A Trump campaign official confirmed that the Republican nominee will not be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his US visit to attend the UN General Assembly opening, despite previous statements from Ukrainian officials suggesting a planned meeting. Trump reiterated his portrayal of Zelenskyy as ""the greatest salesman on Earth"" for securing US aid, erroneously claiming that Zelenskyy receives ""$100 billion"" with each visit to the United States.Trump and Zelenskyy's history dates back to the former president's time in the White House, during which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a cybersecurity firm falsely linked to Ukraine by Trump. This call and the White House's hold on $400 million in military aid led to Trump's first impeachment.In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Zelenskyy suggested that Trump oversimplifies the conflict and that his running mate, JD Vance, advocates for Ukraine to ""make a sacrifice"" by relinquishing territories. Donald Trump Jr criticized Zelenskyy on X, questioning the Ukrainian leader's criticism of the GOP ticket despite receiving substantial US taxpayer funding.While Trump criticized US involvement in the war, Zelenskyy delivered a strong message at the United Nations, arguing that Russia must be forced into a peace settlement. ""Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what's needed,"" Zelenskyy said, addressing the UN Security Council. He firmly rejected any negotiations on Moscow’s terms, calling such proposals “insanity.”Zelenskyy’s speech followed reports of increased military support for Russia from Iran and North Korea. Zelenskyy, along with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urged global powers to address these alliances, accusing Tehran and Pyongyang of assisting Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine.(With inputs from agencies)","Donald Trump will not meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his US visit to the UN General Assembly opening.

Pressure for a deal

Aviva Siegel one of the 251 hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on October 7, remains haunted by her time in captivity in Gaza, where she was held by Hamas for weeks. Although it has been nearly 10 months since her release, her thoughts are still consumed by the fate of her husband, Keith Siegel, who remains in captivity. The Israeli military reported that 33 hostages are believed to be dead.Aviva and her husband were captured from their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza . Aviva was released as part of a truce in November last year, which saw 105 hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Despite her release, Aviva remains overwhelmed by the memories of her ordeal. ""I wanted to die so many times,"" she admitted, describing the physical toll of her captivity. ""When I got out, I had lost 10 kilos. I could barely walk, eat or drink. I don’t want to imagine the situation Keith is in.""""I’m still in Gaza, I haven’t left yet,"" she told reporters. ""I’m with Keith in spirit at all times. I can’t bear to imagine that he and the other hostages are 40 metres below ground, without air to breathe, without food to eat, without anything nice,"" she told AFP.Since her return, Aviva has actively participated in protests in Tel Aviv, demanding a resolution for the remaining hostages. ""Keith is still there,"" she shared during a recent demonstration. ""We have to get them out. It’s too cruel... It’s unbearable and unforgivable.""The urgency has increased since the Israeli military discovered the bodies of six hostages in a Gaza tunnel in August. Like Aviva, other family members of captives, including Raz Ben Ami, who was also freed in the November truce, continue to pressure the government for action. ""I’m sick of burying hostages, returned in coffins,"" Ben Ami said.","Aviva Siegel was one of 251 hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on October 7.

The Israeli airstrikes injured over 1,600 people and forced thousands to flee their homes in the south. Israel claimed that it had struck approximately 1,600 targets in its operation, which aimed to dismantle Hezbollah 's weaponry. However, Lebanon's health minister reported that hospitals, medical centres, and ambulances were also hit in the attacks.In retaliation, Hezbollah announced that it had fired dozens of rockets into Israel, targeting military bases and prompting a series of air-raid sirens to sound in northern Israel.On Friday, an Israeli airstrike demolished a high-rise building in Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit, along with other key leaders. Israel alleged that Akil was responsible for orchestrating attacks on northern Israel. This strike resulted in at least 45 deaths and over 60 injuries.These airstrikes followed a wave of electronic device bombings earlier in the week, which triggered the detonation of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, killing at least 37 people, including two children, and injuring around 3,000.

Israel said it had launched air strikes against hundreds of Hezbollah targets on Monday, killing 356 people in Lebanon's deadliest day in decades according to authorities, as it ramped up a nearly year-long conflict with its Iran-backed enemy. After some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire since the hostilities flared last Oct, Israel warned people in Lebanon to evacuate areas where it said the armed movement was storing weapons.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu sent a short video statement addressed to the Lebanese people. ""Israel's war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah. For too long Hezbollah has been using you as human shields,"" he said. After almost a year of war against Hamas in Gaza on its southern border, Israel is shifting its focus to the northern frontier, where Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, also backed by Iran. Israel's military said it had struck Hezbollah in Lebanon's south, east and north.Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad said the strikes hit hospitals, medical centres and ambulances. He said 356 people had been killed, including 24 children and 42 women, and 1,246 wounded. One official said it was Lebanon's highest daily death toll from violence since the 1975-1990 civil war. It was also the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.Tens of thousands are fleeing southern Lebanon ""due to Israeli atrocities"", Lebanese minister coordinating the crisis response, Nasser Yassin, said. He said 89 temporary shelters in schools and the like had been activated, with capacity for more than 26,000 people so far.On Monday evening an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs targeted Hezbollah commander Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front, but his fate was unclear, a security source told Reuters. Earlier, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said the campaign would continue until ""we achieve our goal to return the northern residents safely to their homes"". Hezbollah has vowed to fight on until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.The Israeli military said it had struck about 1,300 targets connected to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Bekaa valley. ""Among the targets struck were buildings where Hezbollah hid rockets, missiles, launchers, UAVs and additional terrorist infrastructure,"" it said. Hezbollah has not commented on Israeli claims that it hid weapons in houses, but it has said in past that it doesn't place military infrastructure near civilians.In response to the strikes, Hezbollah said it had launched missiles at a military base in northern Israel. Sirens warning of Hezbollah rocket fire sounded across northern Israel, including in the port city of Haifa, and in the northern part of the occupied West Bank. It also targeted for a second day the facilities of the Rafael defence firm in Haifa. Approximately 180 projectiles crossed into Israeli airspace, an AFP report said.Israel's military spokesperson said Israeli aircraft were preparing to attack strategic Hezbollah weapons stashed in houses in the Bekaa valley and urged civilians to evacuate immediately. The strikes have redoubled the pressure on Hezbollah, which last week suffered heavy losses when thousands of pagers and radios used by its members exploded. In another major blow, an Israelistrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday struck senior Hezbollah commanders, killing 45 people.The fighting has raised fears that the US, Israel's ally, and Iran will be sucked into a wider war. Suffering from a financial meltdown, Lebanon can ill afford a war like the one in 2006, when Israel pounded it during a month-long conflict with Hezbollah, inflicting heavy damage to infrastructure.The US is sending additional troops to West Asia during a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, Pentagon said Monday. Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do. The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region.

US Intel says Moscow pumping for Trump as Ukraine brings Russia war to battleground Pennsylvania,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-intel-says-moscow-pumping-for-trump-as-ukraine-brings-russia-war-to-battleground-pennsylvania/articleshow/113642661.cms,"WASHINGTON: Far from being a ruse, Moscow 's interference in US elections, mocked by MAGA supremo Donald Trump as the ""Russia Russia Russia hoax,"" is real and current, US intelligence agencies said on Monday.The agencies, trashed by Trumpists as a war-mongering ""Deep State,"" said while Russia is attempting to boost Trump's candidacy by denigrating his opponent Kamala Harris , China and Iran are also sowing discord in the US using artificial intelligence.A one-page summary of the intelligence assessment released by the Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) cited a specific instance where Russian influencers purportedly staged a video in which a woman claims she was the victim of a hit-and-run car accident by Vice President Harris, and altered videos of her speeches. Social media abounds in slowed down videos of Kamala Harris to make her appear drunk.""Russia has generated the most AI content related to the election and has done so across all four mediums—text, images, audio, and video... consistent with Russia’s broader efforts to boost the former President’s candidacy and denigrate the Vice President and the Democratic Party,"" the summary said.The assessment said China is also using AI in broader influence operations seeking to shape global views of China and amplify divisive U.S. political issues, but not for any specific operations targeting U.S. election outcomes.Trump has repeatedly ridiculed claims that Russia put its thumb on the election scale in his favor in 2016, when he won three states narrowly to clinch the Presidency, while suggesting that an entrenched Deep State in Washington wants an unnecessary confrontation with Moscow. Democrats see him as a Russian stooge who will throwUkraine under the bus if he returns to the White House, which is why they say Moscow is backing him.In fact, the Russia-Ukraine war reared up in the battleground state of Pennsylvania this weekend when Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky visited an arms factory in Scranton -- which happens to be President Biden's home turf -- that is churning out munitions for Ukraine. The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant has ramped up production over the past year to supply more than 3 million 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine, and Zelensky, who is set to meet Biden at the White House on Wednesday, is asking for more arms to beat back Russia.“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail. Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected,"" he wrote on X after the visit to the munitions plant, where he and Pennsylvania's Democratic governor Josh Shapiro signed on artillery shells.The visit outraged Trump and his MAGA principals who fumed on social media that ""a foreign leader is essentially campaigning for Harris on American soil"" and bilking billions of US taxpayer dollars to wage a futile war. ""I think Zelenskiy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,"" Trump said at a rally in western Pennsylvania. ""He wants them to win this election so badly, but I would do differently - I will work out peace.Democrats in turn claimed Putin has ""bought control of Trump's party"" by paying millions to MAGA influencers, a reference to recent disclosures of lavish funding by Russia-backed companies for pro-MAGA commentators. ""Vice President Harris understands that if America walks away from Ukraine, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe and our NATO allies,"" the Harris campaign shot back.Democrats are eyeing a large Polish-American vote in Pennsylvania invoking Russian threats to Poland similar to its invasion of Ukraine. “Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch?” Harris asked Trump during their debate earlier this month.",Russia is attempting to boost Trump's candidacy by denigrating his opponent Kamala Harris.

Arizona: Biden's narrow win in 2020 is complicated by immigration and abortion being dominant issues. Harris, the Schrodinger's ‘Border Czar,’ is visiting the state today – her first trip since becoming the Democratic nominee. It could be a sticky wicket for the Dems. Georgia: Trump faced legal battles over “election interference” here, but the state is crucial. African-American voters backed Biden in 2020, and Harris hopes they’ll support her as well. Michigan: The state’s significant Arab-American population is unhappy with Biden’s Middle East policy. Recently, the mayor of Hamtramck, the only city with an all-Muslim government, endorsed Donald Trump . Nevada: Though the state has voted Democrat since 2008, it’s still considered a swing state despite offering only six electoral votes. The economy and immigration issues make it a battleground for both candidates. North Carolina: The state has been in the news for its lieutenant governor’s controversial comments on a black porn forum, raising concerns that Mark Robinson could jeopardise Trump’s chances. Robinson, heavily backed by Trump for governor, was ignored when Trump recently visited the state. Pennsylvania: Trump is known for his successes here. Democrats had won this state since 1992 until Trump flipped it in 2016. He also survived an assassination attempt, effectively ending Biden’s bid for a second term. Wisconsin: Harris has a slight edge over Trump, but the economy, healthcare, abortion, and crime could create challenges. She leads for now, but can she maintain it?

Game of Thrones

In the Harry Potter universe – whose creator is now defined by her gender-bender takes – the number seven is pivotal. That’s why Lord Voldemort decided to create seven Horcruxes that would have made him immortal, if his sidekick hadn’t fancied the mother of a scrawny git. Seven is a number that frequently recurs in fiction and non-fiction. There are seven kingdoms inseven colours in the rainbow, seven musical notes (), and the number seven graces the backs of iconic sportsmen like MS Dhoni and Eric Cantona.The number seven is equally significant in US elections, where seven swing states can determine the outcome. While swing states may change, for the purposes of this piece, the seven are: Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19), and Wisconsin (10).A candidate needs a majority while battling for 538 electoral college votes. Regardless of the margin of victory, whoever wins a state takes the full electoral college vote count. For example, in Arizona in 2020, Joe Biden won by just 10,457 votes but secured all 11 electoral college votes from the state. It’s possible to win more votes overall, as Clinton did in 2016, and still receive fewer electoral college votes. As NPR ’s Domenico Montanaro noted, “44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin” separated Trump and Biden from a tie in the electoral college. Hillary Clinton famously won the popular vote in 2016 but lost in the electoral college.Essentially, these seven states could decide the fate of the realm.Since 1988, 20 states and Washington, DC have consistently voted for the same party in every presidential election, with only a few seeing close battles. Trump’s unexpected victory in 2016 was due to his ability to swing several key states that had previously voted for Democrats, earning him 304 electoral votes to Hillary's 227. Meanwhile, Biden’s ability to reclaim some of these states was crucial to his victory, where he defeated Trump 306-232.Now a disclaimer: given the unprecedented nature of this election – with a candidate shoehorned in at the last moment after her predecessor lost his bearings, and a former POTUS who has survived two assassination attempts – all bets are off.With fluctuating polls, any state with less than a 5% gap could be in play. A recent NYT-Sienna College poll suggested Trump’s fortunes were looking up in the so-called Sun Belt swing states of Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. However, these polls were taken before the revelations about Trump’s ‘black Nazi’ Mark Robinson’s candid thoughts on a porn forum, which could reverse Trump’s gains in North Carolina.Here's a quick look at each key state:Overall, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck in several polls. According to 538, Harris is nationally leading by 2.7 BPS. In the, to sit on the Iron Throne, you had to wade through eight seasons of incest, bloodletting, politically chicanery and lots of speeches. It was a rather messy affair at times. Hopefully, it won't get that messy on November 5.The Top 10 Stories:","Since 1988, 20 states and Washington, DC have consistently voted for the same party in every presidential election.

What was the visa case against Prince Harry?

Prince Harry's US visa application will remain private despite his admission of taking drugs in his memoir Spare, a judge has ruled in a big win for the Duke of Sussex. Harry in his memoir admitted that he took cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms triggering the case as to whether he should have been allowed into US in 2020. His drug admission became public in 2023 when his memoir was published.US judge Carl Nichols rules that his visa details will not be disclosed publicly as it was not in public interest. ""Like any foreign national, the Duke has a legitimate privacy interest in his immigration status,"" the judge ruled.The judge said Harry revealed intimate details of his life in the book with numerous instances of his drug use. But he concluded that public interest in the Duke's move to America was ""outweighed by the Duke's privacy interest"".The ruling comes as the Duke is in New York with a series of high-profile solo engagements scheduled in the city.In 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quit their royal duties and left the UK to settle in the US where Meghan had her Hollywood career before her marriage to Harry. In 2023, Harry published his memoir 'Spare' in which he admitted drug use. The Duke said cocaine ""didn't do anything for me"", adding: ""Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""A Washington DC-based think tank said application forms for US visas specifically ask about current and past drug abuses. If Harry got US visa, was his visa form not properly vetted, the think-tank asked.Drug use can lead to the rejection of the visa applications though immigration officers have the final say on it. The Heritage Foundation's lawsuit argued that US law ""generally renders such a person inadmissible for entry"" to the country.","US judge Carl Nichols rules that his visa details will not be disclosed publicly as it was not in public interest.
