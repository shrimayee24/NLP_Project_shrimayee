Zubeen Garg Death: CM Clarifies Cause, Fans Recall His Love For Water

Himanta claim in Zubeen case follows reports from Singapore

GUWAHATI: Cultural icon Zubeen Garg's death in Singapore on Sept 19 has been officially treated as a murder case from day one, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday, setting Dec 8 as the deadline for the special investigation team to file its chargesheet with clearance from MHA.""Today, I am not calling it an accident,"" Sarma told reporters. ""As the state's home minister, I get to know what I need to know. Whatever I say, I do so with conviction.""On whether that meant investigators had found evidence Zubeen didn't die in a swimming accident, Sarma said, ""This is not a new revelation from me... Everyone currently in judicial custody has been charged with murder."" Sarma said he briefed home minister Amit Shah on the probe during his visit to Delhi Sunday.Himanta said he requested speedy clearance from MHA for the chargesheet to be filed. The SIT, headed by CID's special DGP MP Gupta, will write to MHA with details within 2-3 days. ""Since the incident occurred on foreign soil, we need prior approval from the ministry before filing the chargesheet.""MP and PCC president Gaurav Gogoi demanded to know what prompted Sarma to explicitly say for the first time that Zubeen didn't die in an accident.""Now, he claims it was murder, but he hasn't told the public how or why it happened,"" Gogoi said, questioning what he said was ""lack of clarity and transparency in the govt's handling of the case"".Sarma had previously only hinted that Zubeen's death while swimming off an island in Singapore may not have been accidental, leading the opposition to ask how he could say so when the chargesheet was still to be filed.The CM's statement came days after Singapore Police Force handed over the final autopsy and toxicology reports to the SIT. Sarma described these reports as ""authentic"" proof of the cause of Zubeen's death, given these tests were conducted immediately after he was declared dead in a hospital there.Zubeen's friend and fellow singer Manas Robin expressed shock at the CM's statement, saying he couldn't have imagined anyone from Assam would target the icon.""The timing of the CM's statement suggests he is not lying. Speaking openly to the public and calling it a murder - there must be some truth in it,"" he said. ""We expect the maximum punishment for the culprits if it was murder."" Seven suspects are in judicial custody, including North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and Zubeen's manager Siddhartha Sharma. Four of them were with Zubeen on the yacht that took him to Lazarus Island. Over 60 FIRs have been filed across Assam in the case.",Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma sets Dec 8 as the deadline for the special investigation team to file its chargesheet.

Deadly Collision on Hyderabad-Bijapur Road: 19 Killed After Truck Rams Into RTC Bus Near Chevella

CHEVELLA: A scream. Then, silence - broken only by cries muffled under stone and steel. The bus lay crushed beneath a mountain of gravel, its passengers trapped - some buried up to their necks - as minutes stretched into nearly an hour before rescuers could reach them.""It felt like the whole world had collapsed on us. We couldn't move or breathe properly,"" said R Venkataiah, 55, a head constable from Vikarabad. He was on a work trip, now lying on a hospital cot, his voice still trembling. ""We screamed for help. But no one could get to us for so long.""By the time emergency crews pulled survivors from the wreckage, many had suffered deep cuts, crushed limbs and spinal injuries. Women, students, and children were among those badly hurt.""It all happened in a flash,"" said C Sri Sai, a 27-year-old govt school teacher from Chevella. Speaking from her hospital bed, her leg wrapped in bandages, she recalled boarding the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation bus around 5am.""I sat in the last row. About an hour later, suddenly there was a huge crash - the entire bus shook violently, people screamed, and within moments everything went dark and dusty.""Her family rushed from Tandur town after hearing the news. ""It took nearly 30 minutes before the rescuers managed to pull us out,"" she said.The truck smashed head-on into the Hyderabad-bound bus, tearing open its right side and spilling gravel. Those seated behind the bus driver never had a chance. ""They were almost instantly buried under the gravel - I could only hear muffled cries,"" said Abdul Razak, 38, another survivor. His hands still shook as he spoke. ""It was nerve-wracking.""Mohammed Yunus, a businessman from Tandur, had climbed aboard the same bus. He escaped with bruises - but not without images he can't forget. ""I was standing in the middle of the bus. When the lorry hit, I fell sideways, and the gravel started pouring in. I thought I would die,"" he said. ""Because I wasn't sitting, I managed to wriggle out through a broken window."" Others weren't as lucky. Many remained pinned, gasping under the weight of stones.""We were buried up to our necks. It was impossible to move. We could hear people groaning in pain,"" said another injured passenger.When the rescue teams - locals, police, and emergency workers - finally broke through the debris, the morning sun had risen high. What they found inside mangled shell of the bus was a scene of devastation that words could barely contain.","Truck smashed head-on into the Hyderabad-bound bus, tearing open its right side and spilling gravel.

(ANI)

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Monday said the age-old “Darbar Move” tradition, discontinued four years ago, was revived by his government to bridge the gap between the twin capitals of the erstwhile state — Jammu and Srinagar.The “Darbar Move” bi-annual tradition of shifting the J&K government offices from Srinagar to Jammu in winter and vice-versa in summer was started by Dogra rulers nearly 150 years ago. In June 2021, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha halted the practice, citing the administration’s complete transition to e-office, which, he claimed, would save approximately Rs 200 crore annually.The tradition was revived by the Abdullah govt on Oct 16.On Monday, CM Abdullah, accompanied by deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and minister Javed Rana, walked approximately 4-5 kms from his official residence on Wazarat Road (Residency Road) in Jammu to the Civil Secretariat in the morning, interacting with traders on Residency Road, Raghunath Bazaar and Shalimar Road on the way.“Jammu suffered the biggest setback since the Darbar Move practice was discontinued. The National Conference had promised to restore it.It was our responsibility, and we have done it today. We hope that with the resumption of the Darbar Move, the economy of not only Jammu but the entire J&K will get a boost,” Omar told reporters. “You must have seen the rousing reception. Today, a distance that takes a few minutes to cover took nearly an hour. It was the love and affection of the people.”Abdullah said some people always try to create a wedge between Jammu and Srinagar and rake up “Jammu versus Kashmir” for political advantage. “We want to address that wedge and remove the distance,” he said.The decision to discontinue the practice in 2021 had drawn sharp criticism from various quarters, including Jammu’s business community, which had termed the move a blow to trade and the traditional bond between the two regions. The trading community had been pressing for the revival of the practice ever since.Abdullah said the tradition was revived by his government to bridge the gap between the twin capitals of the erstwhile state and asserted that some things “should not be weighed by money”.“Everything should not be weighed in money. The ‘Darbar Move’ was stopped to save money. Some things are more than money, as they involve sentiments and unity between the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir ,” he said.","The bi-annual tradition of shifting the J&K government offices from Srinagar to Jammu in winter and vice-versa in summer was started by Dogra rulers nearly 150 years ago.

Watch: Pappu Yadav Gets Angry When Asked Why He Wasn’t Seen with Rahul Gandhi

RJD hits back at PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday stepped up his attack on the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in poll-bound Bihar, questioning why the person responsible for bringing “jungle raj” (lawlessness) to the state is ""missing"" from the party’s posters.Although he did not name anyone, the remark was a clear reference to RJD chief and former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav.“Look at the posters of the RJD and the Congress. The pictures of the person who brought ‘jungle raj’ to Bihar are either missing altogether or so tiny that they can’t be seen even with binoculars,” PM Modi said at a rally in Katihar.“The one who is such a big leader of the RJD, whose entire family is in politics — why are his pictures not being used?” he asked.PM Modi went on to question why Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son, Tejashwi, was ""reluctant"" to mention his own father’s name.“Why are you so ashamed to take your father’s name? What is the wrongdoing that the RJD feels compelled to hide from Bihar’s youth?” he remarked, without naming Tejashwi, the chief ministerial candidate of the RJD-led opposition Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress and other allies.The term “jungle raj” is frequently used by political opponents to attack Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, and the RJD.The RJD hit back at PM Modi, with both Tejashwi Yadav and his sister Misa Bharti taking aim at the prime minister.""PM Modi should talk about the 14 crore people of Bihar, why is he talking about useless things? The kind of profit Lalu Yadav has given to the Railways, PM Modi cannot do that even in 7 births,"" the Mahagathbandhan CM face retorted.""PM Modi has come for Bihar elections or to search for Lalu Yadav's photos? The fear of Lau Yadav has not come out of the minds of NDA leaders and PM Modi. On one side the prime minister of the country talks about 'katta' and on the other side, Tejashwi Yadav talks about providing employment to the youth,"" Bharti remarked.Bihar will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The election is shaping up as a direct contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Mahagathbandhan.","PM Narendra Modi questions why the person responsible for bringing ""jungle raj"" to Bihar is ""missing"" from the party's posters.

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Friday quashed the preventive detention of a man booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) for alleged involvement in anti-national activities.The detainee, Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Drabgam, Pulwama, was represented by Zameer Abdullah and Zahir Abdullah, the two sons of J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah According to the judgment, Bhat was placed under preventive detention after being accused in FIR No. 119 of 2020 at Police Station Rajpora for offences punishable under the Indian Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The Pulwama district magistrate, in a detention order on April 30, 2025, had stated that Bhat had “re-activated his contacts” and was “in close touch with active terrorists in the area”, enabling them to evade arrest. The order had described his activities as “highly prejudicial to the security of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir” and warranting preventive detention under the PSA.Pleading before a single bench of Justice Moksha Khajuria Kazmi, the defence lawyers argued that Bhat had already been arrested in the 2020 FIR and was later released on bail by a competent court on Nov 13, 2023 in the case.In its order, the HC observed that “the counsel for the petitioner have successfully shown that the detainee had been granted bail by a competent court of law, and the impugned detention order, based on the same FIR, is an outcome of stale allegations”.The bench said the detention order issued in 2025 was based on a case registered in 2020, terming it “stale” and lacking a “proximate link” between the alleged actions and the present security situation.The HC directed that the petition be allowed, the detention order be quashed and the respondents directed to release the detainee forthwith if not required in any other case.The judgment comes at a time when PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has moved the HC seeking the return to the UT of all undertrials held in jails outside Jammu and Kashmir.Outside the HC in Jammu on Monday, Mehbooba said they were hoping that the elected govt would take action on the issue of undertrial prisoners lodged in jails outside J&K.National Conference, however, used the judgment to criticise Mehbooba. “While Mehbooba Mufti opts for theatrics with zero benefit to those under detention, Zamir and Zahir quietly do the real work, offering help, legal aid, and support without the drama. What’s needed isn’t noise outside courts but action inside them,” NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said. “National Conference remains committed to advocating the release of those with minor or no charges, and to ensuring that others lodged in distant jails across the country are brought back to J&K,” he said.","Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Drabgam, Pulwama, was represented by Zameer Abdullah and Zahir Abdullah, the two sons of J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah.

BENGALURU: ""I killed my wife for you."" Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional who had spurned his proposal, weeks after his wife's death.In a desperate bid to give marriage a second start, Mahendra got in touch with women, who had earlier dumped him, and came back from the dead to make renewed proposals to half-a-dozen women.According to police, Mahendra administered anaesthesia and killed his wife Kruthika, 29, on April 24. He was arrested on Oct 14 from Manipal, Udupi district, for his wife's death.Police said Mahendra had messaged ‘I killed my wife for you' to the medical professional — not a doctor — through a digital-payment app after she had blocked him on multiple messaging platforms.Police have seized his mobile phone and laptop and sent them to a forensic science laboratory. The data revealed his messages to the woman.Deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) K Parashurama confirmed the messages were sent through PhonePe, a digital-payment app. The woman's statement has been recorded, but police are not revealing any details due to the ongoing investigation.The woman reportedly told police that she had blocked Mahendra before his marriage.After learning about his marriage to Kruthika, the woman stayed away from him. However, he messaged ‘a confession' to her a couple of months after killing his wife. Until Mahendra was arrested on murder charges, the woman had assumed he was falsely confessing to the murder only with an intention to talk to her, a senior police officer said, adding the woman has no role in the crime.Investigating officers found that Mahendra was also in contact with a Mumbai-based woman until 2023. He proposed to marry her and met her a few times. Later, he made his father call and inform her that he had ""died in an accident"". After that, he was not in contact with her.However, Mahendra rose from the ashes and called her in Sept to confirm he was not dead. Instead, according to his astrological chart, his first wife was going to die. Since his ""love for her was genuine"", he told her that he had lied to her and got married to Kruthika. As his wife was dead now, he said that he wanted to marry her.","Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional.

NYC Mayoral Polls: Clash over federal funding



Trump backs Cuomo, he steers clear







US President Donald Trump issued a warning to voters: elect left-wing candidate Zohran Mamdani , and the city will lose federal funds, just a day before New York City’s mayoral election.In a lengthy Truth Social (a platform he owns) post on Monday, Trump wrote: “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home. ”“It can only get worse with a Communist at the helm, and I don’t want to send, as President, good money after bad,” he said, calling Mamdani’s leadership a “Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster.” Trump added that Mamdani’s “principles have been tested for over a thousand years, and never once have they been successful.”Trump also warned Republicans not to split the vote, saying, “A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani.” Instead, he urged New Yorkers to back former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!” Trump wrote.This was not the first time that Trump has threatened to cut federal funding for NYC, earlier during his appearance on 60 Minutes interview on Sunday.""It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a Communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,"" the US president told CBS.Mamdani was swift to react, speaking at a rally in Astoria he said: “In these final days, what was rumored, what was feared, has become, naked and unabashed,” New York Times reported.Mamdani added, “The Maga movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him – not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration.”The White House has already clashed with New York over federal aid and infrastructure projects. Earlier this year, $18 billion earmarked for a major tunnel project was held back, while a judge ruled that a separate rescission of $34 million in counterterrorism funding was “a blatant violation of the law.”Trump’s latest comments reinforce his willingness to use federal funding as leverage — despite the fact that appropriations are constitutionally handled by Congress, not the president.Cuomo, who trailed Mamdani in polls but has since closed the gap, appeared to welcome Trump’s tacit endorsement. “Now it’s gonna be up to the Republicans, and I hope they listen to the president,” he told WABC Radio.Interestingly, hours after Trump's endorsement, Cuomo rejected any suggestion that the 47th POTUS had endorsed him, repeating firmly, “He didn’t say that. He didn’t say that. He did not say that.”Cuomo spent Monday campaigning across all five boroughs, presenting himself as the only candidate experienced enough to “deal with Trump.” Mamdani, 34, who identifies as a democratic socialist, maintained his focus on making New York more affordable, while Sliwa, the Republican nominee, continued his tough-on-crime message.Recent polling by AtlasIntel put Mamdani ahead with 41% support, followed by Cuomo at 34% and Sliwa at 24%.","US President Donald Trump issued a warning to voters: elect left-wing candidate Zohran Mamdani and the city will lose federal funds. Trump also warned Republicans not to split the vote, saying, “A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!)” Instead, he urged New Yorkers to back former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125073764,imgsize-761652,width-400,resizemode-4/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayoral-elections.jpg"
Is Nancy Pelosi quitting politics? Democrats brace as 85-year-old former House Speaker prepares to exit stage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-nancy-pelosi-quitting-politics-democrats-brace-as-85-year-old-former-house-speaker-prepares-to-exit-stage/articleshow/125066647.cms,"'Shut Up': Nancy Pelosi's On-Cam Meltdown Goes Viral After Reporter Presses Her On Capitol Riots

'I wish she would stay'



Who is running for her seat?



Pelosi stays focused on Prop 50



End of an era







Democrats are quietly preparing for the possible retirement of Nancy Pelosi, the long-time face of the party in Congress and one of the most formidable political figures in modern American history.At 85, the Speaker Emerita is expected to announce her future plans after Tuesday’s elections, which will include a key ballot measure, Proposition 50, that could reshape California’s congressional map.Pelosi has represented San Francisco for almost four decades and has yet to say if she will run again in 2026. Still, talk is growing among Democrats in Washington and back home in California that she might finally call it a day.Multiple party insiders told NBC News they believe Pelosi will not seek another term. “I wish she would stay for 10 more years,” said one California Democrat. “I think she’s out. She’s going to go out with Prop 50 overwhelmingly passing, and what a crowning achievement for her to do that.”If confirmed, Pelosi’s departure would close a chapter in American politics marked by her skill in managing legislative deals, uniting Democrats, and raising record funds.The first woman to ever hold the speaker’s gavel, she became both a trailblazer and the Republican Party’s favourite target, particularly during Donald Trump’s presidency.“She’s preparing to exit the stage,” a Democratic leadership aide told NBC. “We will not fully appreciate the time we have spent with her until she’s gone.”Despite having more than $1.5 million in her campaign account and raising over $2 million this cycle, Pelosi has made no move to deter two Democrats already running for her seat: state Senator Scott Wiener and former tech executive Saikat Chakrabarti, a onetime chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Pelosi’s spokesman, Ian Krager, dismissed talk of retirement as “pure speculation,” insisting her focus remains on Tuesday’s “Yes on 50” campaign. The measure is strongly backed by governor Gavin Newsom and Democrats, and aims to redraw congressional districts in their favour.“Proposition 50” (Prop 50) refers to a California ballot measure that would redraw the state’s congressional districts to give Democrats an advantage in upcoming elections.“Speaker Pelosi is fully focused on her mission to win the Yes on 50 special election in California on Tuesday,” Krager said. “She urges all Californians to join in that mission on the path to taking back the House for Democrats.”In a recent interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Pelosi herself hinted that no decision would come until after the vote. “Here’s the thing: We must win the House. If you talk about ‘no kings,’ we must win the House to put a stop to this. We won’t be able to get many things done, but we’ll be able to stop a lot of the poison that he’s putting there,” she said, referring to Donald Trump.“There’s a lot riding on this because this is the path to our winning the House,” she added. “We will win the House regardless, but winning it big, and we want to win Nov. 4 big.”Pelosi’s leadership has been defined by toughness and strategic brilliance. Known for saying she “eats nails for breakfast,” she mastered both negotiation and persuasion.Ro Khanna, another California Democrat, called her “a stateswoman who, as they say about Lincoln, belongs to the ages. Generations to come will be reading about her contributions to America.”Ashley Etienne, who worked for both Pelosi and former vice president Kamala Harris, praised her as “a pragmatist who hammered out deals in the interest of the nation.”“Pelosi’s loss is bigger than even to the Democratic Party; it’s a loss to the institution,” Etienne said. “She’s not just redefined the speakership, but she’s also demonstrated what real sound, principled leadership looks like, man or woman, but definitely as a woman. Pelosi is a beast. She’s the best to ever do it.”If Pelosi steps down, the race for her San Francisco seat could become one of the most-watched in the country.","At 85, the Speaker Emerita is expected to announce her future plans after Tuesday’s elections.

'I saw tower collapse in diagonal way': Eye witness







A worker, who had been rescued from the rubble of the collapsed medieval Torre dei Conti in central Rome, died, Italian news outlet Corriere della Sera reported after midnight on Tuesday.Crowds had cheered when emergency services freed him on Monday evening, but crews, who worked through the night amid the risk of further collapses, were unable to save him.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni named the man as Octay Stroici in a statement after midnight, saying ""she shares deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss"".""We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering,"" she added.Another worker was seriously injured when the Torre dei Conti collapsed twice on Monday during renovation work.Italy’s national fire department spokesman Luca Cari said one worker was in hospital in a critical condition, while three other workers were pulled out unharmed.Hundreds of tourists watched firefighters use a mobile ladder to reach the upper level of the 29-metre (95 ft) tower, where the man had been trapped by the first collapse sometime before noon.During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure collapsed, sending a cloud of debris over the area and forcing firefighters to retreat. Large clouds of dust filled the square, accompanied by the sound of falling masonry.The tower remained standing but suffered significant internal damage.Gelato shop worker Queen Paglinawan, 27, said she heard two loud noises in quick succession. She said: ""I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way.""German student Viktoria Braeu, 18, said: ""We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. ... And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting.'""No firefighters were injured. A drone was flown up to check the condition of the trapped worker.Rome city authorities said the Torre dei Conti, also known as the Tower of the Counts, has not been used since 2006 and was undergoing a four-year renovation project due to end next year.The surrounding area on Via dei Fori Imperiali had been closed off to pedestrians during the work. The tower, built in 1238 by Pope Innocent III for his family, was originally twice as high but was scaled down after damage from earthquakes in the 14th and 17th centuries.",Italian PM Giorgia Meloni named the man as Octay Stroici in a statement after midnight.

US shutdown: Trump administration to pay half of food stamp benefits in November — how will SNAP funding work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-trump-administration-to-pay-half-of-food-stamp-benefits-in-november-how-will-snap-funding-work/articleshow/125072250.cms,"FULL PRESSER: Hakeem Jeffries Rips ‘PUPPET MASTER’ Trump As Shutdown Blame Game Continues

Snap benefits delays

How will SNAP benefits be funded?

Court rulings





The Trump administration said Monday that it would provide only half of the normal food stamp benefits for November by tapping into the programme’s contingency fund amid the government shutdown, but recipients were unlikely to see the payments immediately.Some $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme’s contingency fund will “be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households’ current allotments” for November, according to a sworn statement from a US Department of Agriculture official submitted in federal court, CNN reported.The remaining $600 million in the fund will be used for state administrative expenses and nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa.The decision came after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opted to draw only on SNAP’s contingency fund.In court papers filed Monday, the administration said it decided against pulling $4 billion from other sources of money to provide full benefits for November.Some SNAP recipients were due to receive funds in the first few days of November, meaning their benefits have already been delayed.The logistical challenge posed by a partial delivery of benefits is expected to delay payments further, though the timeline will likely vary from state to state, experts told ABC News.Using emergency funds to pay for reduced SNAP benefits could take ""a few weeks to up to several months,"" a top US Department of Agriculture official told a federal judge in a sworn court filing on Monday.Since food stamp benefits are administered at the state level, the USDA is expected to provide instructions to state agencies, which will then calculate the level of partial benefits for each recipient and provide those figures to be loaded onto the electronic cards used by families, Tracy Roof, professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island who studies the food stamp programme, told ABC News.""The daunting part is that states have to go in and make this adjustment to their payment amounts,"" Roof said, estimating the operational hurdle could range from several days to more than a week after a federal directive, depending on the state.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke alongside Donald Trump during a press availability in the Oval Office of the White House on September 05-2025 in Washington, DC.The Trump administration committed to spend SNAP funds available in an emergency account meant to aid families in the event of an interruption of the programme. That reserve of contingency funds carries a total of about $6 billion, according to the non-partisan Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, putting the account well short of the $8 billion necessary to fully fund SNAP in November.The Trump administration said it would tap $4.65 billion in funds. The Trump administration opted against drawing upon a larger pot of money set aside for child nutrition programmes by the Department of Agriculture.This alternate fund holds about $30 billion, far exceeding roughly $3 billion per month needed to fund the relevant child nutrition payments, David Super, law professor at Georgetown University, told ABC News. ""The Trump administration could transfer enough money over to SNAP to pay for full benefits in November without any conceivable risk to child nutrition,"" Super said, adding that the fund could likely also support full benefits in December ""without breaking a sweat. ""In his ruling last week, Judge John McConnell, of the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, gave the administration until 12 p.m. ET on Monday to say what it planned to do.A second federal judge, in Boston, issued a similar order last week, saying the agency was required to use SNAP’s contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits. Both judges said it was up to the agency’s discretion whether to access other money to enable it to provide full payments.The USDA had maintained that it could not tap into its contingency fund, stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”It also noted that the contingency funds are meant to pay food benefits in the case of natural disasters. President Donald Trump indicated Friday evening that he wanted benefits to resume, posting on Truth Social that he instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it could legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available. ”The decision to halt benefits prompted a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, to file a lawsuit in Boston on Tuesday and a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to bring the case in Rhode Island on Thursday.",$4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme’s contingency fund will “be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households’ current allotments’ for November. The remaining $600 million in the fund will be used for state administrative expenses and nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125072352,imgsize-44848,width-400,resizemode-4/us-government-shutdown-ap-image.jpg"

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics

Patel uses $60 million jet to fly to his girlfriend's event, fires senior FBI official



'Patel flew from Mar-A-Lago to Nashville'







FBI director Kash Patel is MAGA's target this week as MAGA commentators did not like Patel's statement shielding his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins from troll attacks. Patel said he, in his public role, is open to criticism, but his girlfriend is not. Calling her a true patriot, Patel sent a strong message to people who are attacking her, suggesting that they are supposed allies. Right-wing commentator Candace Owens disapproved of Kash Patel's defence of his girlfriend only because Alexis Wilkins is not Patel's wife. ""I don’t care about Alexis one way or another but I want to point out that the head of the FBI is tweeting out in defense of his girlfriend. Not a wife— but a girlfriend. We are just not a serious nation whatsoever,"" Candace said.Some social media posts claimed that Kash Patel's girlfriend said that additional sleeper cells are preparing to launch attacks across the United States. This led to fresh speculations that Wilkins is a spy -- a narrative that never died and continued to find fans. ""I have long been a political commentator in my own right. It is clear that through Biden’s open border policies, we have had an influx of terrorists funneled into our country, which results in grave danger for American citizens,"" Wilkins said, defending her apparent statement.Amid a row over Alexis' statement, Patel flew to Pennsylvania to attend a pro-wrestling event where Alexis performed. This was pointed out by ex-FBI agent Kyle Seraphin who hammered home the discrepancy between Patel's extravagance and government officials not getting their salaries because of the ongoing shutdown. FBI pushed back and issued a statement that whenever Patel uses government jets for personal use, he make advance reimbursement.But FBI also fired a senior official, Steven Palmer , who was in charge of FBI's aviation units.Kyle Seraphin, who had already been sued by Alexis Wilkins for claiming that she is a spy, claimed that Patel blocked public tracking of his government-owned jet and again traveled from Mar-A-Lago to Nashville. ""Kash blocked access to OUR taxpayer funded FBI jet (so I paid extra to keep tracking it). Last night, he flew down to Mar-A-Lago (allegedly to be yelled at). And then, after firing Stephen Palmer, flew direct to Nashville,"" Seraphin posted."," MAGA targets Kash Patel as he speaks up for his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins.

What is the Hindu-Christian row?



'She Has No Plans To Convert': JD Vance Clarifies Amid Row Over Remark On Wife's Faith

Dinesh D'Souza stirs controversy with his story of conversion







The Hindu-Christian row triggered by Vice President JD Vance refuses to die down as commentators unravel several aspects of what he said about his religion and his wife's religion, and then what he said in defence. Indian-origin Christian MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza who supported JD Vance in his hope that Usha Vance one day embraces Christianity said Hindus should have no problem if Usha Vance converts to Christianity if Hinduism is truly inclusive.At a Turning Point USA event, JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith. “As I’ve told her, and as I’ve said publicly, and as I’ll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing I was moved by in church? Yes. I honestly do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope that eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,"" JD Vance said.""But if she doesn’t, God says that everybody has free will, so that doesn’t cause a problem with me. That’s something that you work out with your friends, your family, the person you most love,"" JD Vance said.Two major criticisms followed: one, as he called his Hindu wife an agnostic and two, overall for undermining his wife's Hindu faith.JD Vance defended what he said and explained that Christians do want to share their faith with others and it is a completely normal thing. ""My Christian faith tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings. My wife--as I said at the TPUSA--is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to re-engage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage--or any interfaith relationship--I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" JD Vance said, repeating that he would love it if Usha Vance converts to Christianity.Mumbai-born MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza, in his attempt to support JD Vance, created another controversy as he spoke about the conversion of his ancestors to Christianity. He said they must have been so oppressed because of being low cast that they chose to convert to Christianity. However, this account was proved to be false as he himself wrote in his book that his grandfather told him they were Brahmins.","Vice President JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith.

All you need to know about Telangana bus crash



The accident occurred near Khanapur Gate under Chevella police limits in Ranga Reddy district early Monday morning.

Police confirmed that the tipper truck, carrying gravel, was coming from the wrong side of the road when it collided with the TSRTC bus.

The bus was travelling from Tandur to Hyderabad and reportedly had around 72 passengers on board, according to preliminary information from the conductor.

Rivals struggle with Mamdani's name

Elon Musk has landed in controversy over his latest remarks, as people said he is being ""racist"" purposely against ""coloured people."" The backlash of the billionaire started after he misspelt the New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani 's name while endorsing his rival, Andrew Cuomo.Taking to X, Musk urged voters to back Cuomo, writing: ""Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is. Vote Cuomo!""He further added that voting for Republican Curtis Sliwa would effectively help Mamdani, who has surged in polls while focusing on key issues like child care, housing affordability and more.Cuomo is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary; meanwhile, Sliwa is also in the race. Musk's statement came ahead of voting on November 4 for the mayoral race.Musk's remark is being widely seen as mocking Mamdani's Indian name, triggering a wave of criticism. ""You can sorely dislike one's policies, but butchering a person's name on purpose is a third-rate, middle-schooler tactic. Oh wait…,"" said Crstl Tech CEO Dipti Desai.British-American broadcaster and writer Mehdi Hasan added, ""You can take the boy out of apartheid, but can you take the apartheid out of the boy?""Social media users attacked Musk for his comment, calling him ""racist"" and ""childish,"" noting a pattern where non-white names are deliberately mispronounced or ridiculed.""One of the easiest tells that someone is racist is when they purposely mispronounce coloured people's names that are actually very easy to read,"" wrote one user.""One of the easiest tells that someone is racist is when they purposely mispronounce coloured people's names that are actually very easy to read,"" an X used said.""When Elon messes up your name you sure know you’re winning and he isn’t happy about it but can’t stop it,"" another wrote in the comments.""Musk, why are you so obsessed with propping up rapists and washed-up predators?"" one asked. ""Also — it’s Zohran Mamdani, but I get it… names that aren't white or billionaire-adjacent must short-circuit your apartheid-brain wiring.""Mamdani, the 34-year-old son of India-origin Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani and Indian filmmaker Mira Nair, could become New York City’s first Muslim mayor if elected. His rivals — Cuomo and Sliwa — have also repeatedly struggled with the pronunciation of his name during campaign events and debates.The backlash adds to Musk’s growing list of controversies on X, where his political endorsements and inflammatory remarks often fuel public outrage — this time over what many see as a disrespectful, racially charged dig at a rising progressive figure.If elected, the 34-year-old Mamdani, son of India-origin Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani and Indian filmmaker Mira Nair, could become New York City’s first Muslim mayor.Previously, Mamdani's rivals, Cuomo and Sliwa, have also struggled with the pronunciation of his name during campaign events and debates.Just a day before the mayoral election, US President Donald Trump issued a warning to voters, saying that if Zohran Mamdani wins, the city will lose federal funds.In a lengthy Truth Social post on Monday, Trump wrote: ""If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.""""It can only get worse with a Communist at the helm, and I don't want to send, as President, good money after bad,"" he said, calling Mamdani's leadership a ""Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster.""

'Daily collisions don’t shock anyone’: Why locals call Hyderabad-Chevella stretch a ‘death corridor’ that killed 19; 280 dead since 2018,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/daily-collisions-dont-shock-anyone-why-locals-call-hyderabad-chevella-stretch-a-death-corridor-that-killed-19-280-dead-since-2018/articleshow/125073847.cms,"



HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad-Chevella stretch of NH-163 is grimly referred to by locals as a ‘death corridor’, and recent accidents have only reinforced the label.Official data and local accounts reveal that between 2018 and December 2024, at least 280 people have died in accidents on this stretch.The 100-km highway, which winds through Chevella, Manneguda, Vikarabad, and Kodangal, is narrow, riddled with blind turns, and lacks road dividers. Its crumbling surface and absence of crash barriers or reflectors make it extremely hazardous. According to EMRI (108 ambulance) staff, the stretch records six to seven accidents every single day, claiming hundreds of lives over the years.The dangers are ongoing. Barely hours after Monday’s fatal crash that killed 19 people, two men on a bike collided near Tolkatta in Moinabad mandal while attempting to overtake a lorry, leaving both injured. During Dasara, a father-daughter duo died in front of the Chevella police station after being hit by a lorry.“Every day we respond to at least seven emergency calls from this stretch,” said S Sangameshwar, an EMRI ambulance driver stationed in Chevella. “At night, the potholes and broken patches are invisible. Many smaller accidents go unreported because victims just move on.”Doctors at the government hospital in Chevella, where victims of Monday’s crash were taken, confirmed the constant strain on medical services.“We get three to four accident cases a day,” said Dr Rajendra Prasad, hospital superintendent. “Others are shifted to Vikarabad or Hyderabad depending on the severity.”Locals have repeatedly appealed to authorities to widen and repair the road, but their pleas have largely gone unanswered. “Everyone knows this is the most dangerous highway in Telangana. For years, we’ve written to officials to fix it, but they blame delays on clearances and environmental objections,” said Shaik Alam Pasha, a resident of Vikarabad.Several residents also blamed activists who stalled road expansion through the National Green Tribunal to protect trees. “They saved trees, but people keep dying. How is that fair? When other highways are being widened, why is this one – carrying thousands of vehicles daily – left untouched?” asked P Narsimhulu from Aloor village.Locals recalled that the road was a single lane until 25 years ago, when it was widened to two lanes. Since then, traffic has exploded, but safety measures haven’t kept pace. “Now, only major crashes make news. The rest – the daily collisions, the bruised and broken – don’t even shock anyone anymore,” Narsimhulu added.With narrow lanes, blind turns, crumbling surfaces, and minimal safety infrastructure, the Hyderabad-Chevella stretch of NH-163 remains a perilous route, claiming lives almost every day despite repeated warnings from residents and emergency responders alike.","The Hyderabad-Chevella stretch of NH-163 is referred to by locals as a ‘death corridor’ According to EMRI (108 ambulance) staff, the stretch records six to seven accidents every single day.

"Former Prince Andrew brought 40 prostitutes to hotel in Thailand using taxpayer money, reveals historian; 'spectacular fall from grace'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/former-prince-andrew-brought-40-prostitutes-to-hotel-in-thailand-using-taxpayer-money-reveals-historian-spectacular-fall-from-grace/articleshow/125022496.cms,"'No moral boundaries'





Furious Sandringham Residents Slam Andrew’s Move; “He’s A Horrible Man, We Don’t Want Him Here!”

Prince Charles predicted Andrew would 'chase women and play golf'





Why was Andrew stripped of his titles?





Disgraced royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to Thailand, according to royal historian Andrew Lownie.Speaking on the Daily Mail podcast Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York, Lownie accused Andrew of using his role as the UK’s Trade Envoy to “chase women and line his pockets”. He claimed the former prince “had no moral boundaries” and often turned official visits into private holidays.Lownie described what he called Andrew’s “spectacular fall from grace” and said British diplomats allowed the alleged incidents to happen.Andrew went to Thailand to celebrate the birthday of the King.“There was a famous trip to Thailand for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did,” Lownie said. “Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian told podcast host Sarah Vine that his information was verified by multiple sources, including a Reuters correspondent and a member of the Thai royal family.Lownie also claimed that then-Prince Charles had warned against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role back in 2001, fearing he would “just chase women and play golf.” Despite the warning, Lownie said Charles was overruled by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his close ally Peter Mandelson.He described Andrew at the time as “a man in the middle of a midlife crisis.” “In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women,” said Lownie.“He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips. He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things,"" Lownie added.Beyond the claims of sex-fuelled trips, Lownie said his greater concern was Andrew’s alleged misuse of his trade role for personal gain. He accused the former prince of using the position to further business interests for himself and his associate David Rowlands.Prince Andrew was first stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022 after facing a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the United States, filed by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abusing her when she was 17 — allegations he denied. His association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had already severely tarnished his public image.Earlier this week, King Charles III went further, removing all of Andrew’s remaining royal titles and honours and evicting him from his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge. The decision followed renewed public outrage after revelations in Giuffre’s posthumous memoir about Epstein’s network and Andrew’s alleged involvement.",Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to Thailand.

North Korea says its longtime ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam has died,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-its-longtime-ceremonial-head-of-state-kim-yong-nam-has-died/articleshow/125072710.cms,"Kim Yong Nam, head of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea (Image credits: AP)





SEOUL: Kim Yong Nam, a quintessential North Korean bureaucrat whose lifelong loyalty to the ruling Kim dynasty allowed him to serve as the country's ceremonial head of state for two decades, has died, state media reported on Tuesday.The Korean Central News Agency said Kim Yong Nam, former president of the Presidium of North Korea 's rubber-stamp Supreme People's Assembly, died on Monday of multiple organ failure at the age of 97.KCNA said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the bier of Kim Yong Nam to express deep condolences over his death. It said Kim Yong Nam's funeral was set for Thursday.Kim Yong Nam was not related to Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong Un, grandson of state founder Kim Il Sung, took power upon his father Kim Jong Il's death in 2011 in the country's second hereditary power transfer.Kim Yong Nam served as head of the Supreme People's Assembly from 1998 to April 2019. That post is North Korea's nominal head of state, though the true power was held by the Kim family that has ruled the North since its formal foundation in 1948.Kim Yong Nam, who was known for propaganda-filled speeches with a deep, booming voice at key state events, often appeared in state media greeting visiting foreign dignitaries on behalf of Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il.In February 2018, he travelled to South Korea with Kim Jong Un's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong , to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics as Pyongyang sought better ties with Seoul and Washington after years of heightened animosities on the Korean Peninsula.The trip made Kim Yong Nam the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since Kim Jong Un sent a top military officer to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon.At the Pyeongchang opening ceremony, Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong sat within feet of then-US vice-president Mike Pence, though the two sides made no apparent contact.North Korea's temporary diplomatic openness peaked with the summits between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, but Kim Yong Nam did not attend them and his influence was seen as waning due to his age.In April 2019, he was replaced by Choe Ryong Hae, one of Kim Jong Un's close confidants who previously served as the top political officer of the North's 1.2 million-member military.Kim Yong Nam's career epitomised that of a successful North Korean bureaucrat. He joined the ruling Workers' Party shortly after the 1950-53 Korean War and survived major political purges through the 1970s. He was appointed to the powerful Politburo in 1978 and served 15 years as foreign minister, starting in 1983. During his tenure, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated, leaving North Korea isolated.North Korea watchers also say Kim Yong Nam had an expertise in third-world diplomacy. He was a frequent participant in gatherings of nations that consider themselves independent from major power blocs, including the 2012 Non-Aligned Movement (Nam) summit in Iran.People who met Kim Yong Nam described him as mild-mannered but staunch in his opinions.""I found Kim Yong Nam a puzzling figure. In greetings before business began, he was cordial and relaxed, but once at work, he relentlessly followed his script in a way that reminded of former Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko,"" former Washington Post reporter Don Oberdofer wrote in his book, ""The Two Koreas"".In a testament to his loyalty to the ruling dynasty, Kim Yong Nam read an elegy to Kim Il Sung when he died in 1994. He also undertook the job of formally nominating Kim Jong Il to be chairman of the national defence commission after the son observed a three-year mourning period.A native of Pyongyang, Kim Yong Nam studied at the Kim Il Sung University and the Moscow State University.","Kim Yong Nam served as head of the Supreme People's Assembly from 1998 to April 2019.

Is Russia behind this decision?

What is Tomahawk missiles?

Will not giving missiles to Ukraine weaken its fight against Russia?





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday aboard Air Force One that, for now, he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.Trump was cool to a plan for the United States to sell Tomahawks to NATO nations that would transfer them to Ukraine, saying he did not want to escalate the war. His latest comments to reporters indicated he remained reluctant.“No, not really,” Trump told reporters as he flew to Washington from Palm Beach, Florida, when asked whether he was considering a deal to sell the missiles. He added, however, that he could change his mind.He and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had discussed the Tomahawk idea when they met at the White House on October 22.Rutte said on Friday that the issue was under review and that it was up to the United States to decide.Earlier, Russia had raised the issue of Washington supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine and warned that such military support could harm US–Russia relations and adversely affect any peace process.The US President later told journalists at the White House that he had spoken to Putin about Tomahawk missiles. “I did actually say to him, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousands of Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him,” Trump told reporters, adding that Putin did not appear to like that idea.“What do you think he’s [Putin’s] going to say, ‘Please sell Tomahawks?’ No, he doesn’t want Tomahawks to be supplied to Ukraine,” he added.According to US defence information, Tomahawk missiles were developed in the 1970s. They are long-range cruise missiles launched from ships or submarines and are generally used for long-distance attacks. The Pentagon’s budget documents state that the missile can make “deep-strike” attacks on land and “uses a combination of inertial navigation, GPS, and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) or Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) for precision guidance”.Tomahawks fly at supersonic speed at low altitudes – about 30 metres off the ground – and have a range of more than 1,250–2,500 km. They usually carry conventional warheads but can also carry nuclear ones.The US, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia have all used these missiles in combat.So far, the US has launched more than 2,300 Tomahawks from its ships and submarines during operations in Syria and Libya, among others.Possibly yes. The missiles’ long-range precision would allow Kyiv to strike Russia’s critical energy infrastructure, a key pillar of Moscow’s war economy, according to CSIS.A sustained campaign targeting oil and gas facilities could weaken Russia’s ability to fund and supply its war, potentially forcing it to negotiate.However, analysts caution that a handful of missiles won’t shift the balance — hundreds would be needed for meaningful impact. Even then, success would depend on consistent, focused strikes and the indirect effects trickling through Russia’s economy and public pressure.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics





FBI director Kash Patel put out a statement amid the new allegations against him that he went to attend his girlfriend's performance in Pennsylvania on a $60 million FBI jet. FBI directors are not allowed to travel on any commercial plane and are supposed to use FBI jet for their personal use too paying reimbursement for that. But a former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin sensationalized this as he brought this to the notice of the people on his podcast as he said: “We’re in the middle of a government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?""FBI clarified that Patel always pays reimbursement in advance and his personal use is limited as he's always on FBI duty .But the FBI director made it a point to send across a message to ""supposed allies"" who are staying silent when he and his partner are under ""baseless"" attack.""Let me be clear: we will not be distracted by baseless rumors or the noise from uninformed internet anarchists and the fake news. I’ve always said — criticize me all you want. But going after the people doing great work, my personal life, or those around me is a total disgrace,"" Patel said.""The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I’m so blessed she’s in my life.""""Attacking her isn’t just wrong — it’s cowardly and jeopardizes our safety. My love of family will always be my cornerstone, and you will never tear that down or keep me from them.

Claims that Russia and China are secretly conducting nuclear tests

The Iran operation and nuclear deterrence

On healthcare and the fight over Obamacare



‘I won’t be extorted’: Trump refuses to negotiate over govt shutdown







US President Donald Trump appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes in his first interview with the network since settling a lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year.Trump had famously walked out of a 60 Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl before the 2020 election, accusing the show of bias. Trump later sued the company over the newsmagazine’s interview with Kamala Harris, and Paramount reportedly paid $16 million to settle the case this summeIn his latest appearance, Trump defended his administration’s handling of key foreign and domestic challenges, from nuclear tensions and Middle East diplomacy to immigration, healthcare, and the ongoing government shutdown.The sit-down, recorded Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence with journalist Norah O’Donnell, aired Sunday night.President Trump alleged that both Russia and China have been secretly testing nuclear weapons underground. “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” he said. Asked why he recently ordered the United States to conduct its own nuclear tests, Trump explained, “You don’t necessarily know where they’re testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. ”“Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times.Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot,” he siad.Speaking about Iran, Trump said that his administration had “blasted the hell out of them” to prevent Tehran from becoming a nuclear power. “You could’ve never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran,” he said.He described meeting the pilots who carried out the strike and inviting them to the White House. “They told me something I didn’t know. They said, ‘Sir, for 22 years we’ve been practising this route … and you were the only president that let us do our job.’”Trump praised them as “real American heroes,” adding, “When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded … they deserve to come to the White House.”During the interview, Trump acknowledged the precarious balance in South Asia, noting that the United States continues to monitor India and Pakistan closely. Although he avoided direct mention of current military developments, administration officials have said Washington remains wary of escalation in the region, especially given the ongoing nuclear concerns.Trump once again claimed he helped prevent a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. “I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the US,” Trump said, adding, “If it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals... They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan.”Trump cited comments by Pakistan’s prime minister, saying, “If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now.”In May, India launched Operation Sindoor, carrying out precision strikes on terrorist camps located across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, which had killed 26 civilians the previous month.India has firmly denied any US involvement, reiterating that de-escalation was achieved solely through direct military communication between the two nations.Trump repeatedly attacked former President Barack Obama’s legacy, linking him to what he called “a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president.” He even ridiculed the Obama Presidential Center project in Chicago, saying, “He’s building a museum that’s, like, four times over budget … The neighbourhood doesn’t even want ‘em.”At one point, Trump hit out at New York Mayoral race front-runner Zohran Mamdani , invoking them in the context of what he sees as elite detachment from “real American” priorities.“Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far--far worse than a Socialist. Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history,” the 47th POTUS said.He went on to add, “I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time.”Trump used the platform to claim success in halting illegal immigration across the US-Mexico border. “We have a closed border right now,” he said. “For five months in a row, they have zero — think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border.”He accused Mexico of allowing “their prisons to be emptied into our country,” calling it one of his administration’s greatest challenges. “Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. They were criminals, murderers, drug dealers, people from jails and mental institutions,” he said.When asked if Nicolás Maduro’s days as Venezuela’s president were numbered, Trump said, “I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.”Pressed by O’Donnell about speculation that the United States might be preparing strikes in Venezuela, Trump refused to confirm or deny it. “I’m not gonna tell you what I’m gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn’t going to do it,” he said, calling it a matter of national security.He pointed to the rise of violent transnational gangs such as Tren de Aragua, saying Venezuela had “been bad” in exporting criminal networks.Asked about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s upcoming visit to the White House and his insistence that the kingdom would not join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution, Trump replied, “No. I think he’s gonna join.”He added, “We will have a solution. I don’t know if it’s gonna be two-state. That’s gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me.”Trump argued that peace in the Middle East was only possible because his administration prevented Iran from becoming a nuclear power.The president squarely blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, now in its sixth week. “Democrats’ fault,” he said flatly, accusing them of refusing to vote for an extension that would reopen federal offices. “They don’t wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for them, but the polls are turning around.”He said Democrats were suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome” and insisted, “All they have to do, Norah, is say, ‘Let’s vote.’ And you can open the economy during our interview.”Healthcare dominated much of the domestic discussion. Trump said Democrats were blocking progress on reform. “We almost did it. We were one vote short. John McCain made a mistake, frankly,” he said.He repeated his long-standing criticism of the Affordable Care Act, calling it “bad healthcare at far too high a price.” “It’s too expensive for the people,” Trump said. “They’re gonna get a very big increase this year.”Democrats have pushed to extend subsidies under Obamacare to prevent premiums from doubling for millions of Americans. O’Donnell noted that “three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election.” Trump responded, “And I’m saying we can fix it.”Trump rejected calls to compromise with Democrats to reopen the government. “I won’t be extorted,” he said, insisting that he would not “give $1.5 trillion so that prisoners, drug dealers and people from mental institutions” could receive welfare or healthcare.He also pressed Republicans to end the Senate filibuster, telling 60 Minutes, “Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.”","US President Donald Trump appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes in his first interview with the network since settling a lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year.

He will now move to a property on the Sandringham Estate, which will be privately funded by the King.Meanwhile, in the US, members of a congressional committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case have intensified their calls for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to answer questions about his links to the late sex offender.At least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee renewed their calls for Andrew to testify, although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: ""If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward"".Andrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said. ""Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.""So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.""He added: ""No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.""Fellow committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew with a subpoena, although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US.","Donald Trump said he felt ""badly"" for the UK royal family after Andrew Mountbatten Windsor was stripped of his titles.

California Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi on Monday described President Donald Trump as a “vile creature” and “the worst thing on the face of the Earth” and said she would announce any decision on seeking another term in Congress after Election Day on Tuesday.The former House speaker made the remarks in an interview with CNN’s Elex Michaelson, during a discussion of Thomas Jefferson’s vision of the United States and the separation of powers among the three branches of government, in contrast with Trump’s expansive view of executive power.“Our founders did not want to have again — how can I say this? It’ll sound like I’m awful about Trump, because he’s just a vile creature, the worst thing on the face of the Earth,” she said.Asked whether she really believed that, Pelosi responded: “Yeah, I do.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Indian time) warned he would restrict federal funds for New York City if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election, called the candidate a Communist, and predicted total economic disaster under his leadership.Posting on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at the NYC Democratic candidate, accusing him of having no chance to bring the city back to its former glory.“If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing federal funds, other than the very minimum as required,” Trump wrote.“As a Communist, this once great city has zero chance of success, or even survival I don’t want to send good money after bad.”Trump, who was born in Queens and often refers to New York as his first home, said it was his obligation to run the Nation and claimed the city would become a complete and total economic and social disaster if Mamdani won.He said he would even prefer a Democrat with a record of success over Mamdani, urging New Yorkers to back former governor Andrew Cuomo, whom he called capable.“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” Trump added.“You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job.”Trump also jabbed at Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, quipping that a vote for Sliwa is a vote for Mamdani and adding that Sliwa looks much better without the beret.Trump’s post marked his most direct intervention yet in a local race that has drawn national attention amid deep ideological divides over housing, policing, and federal aid.Candidates for mayor of New York City, are racing to the finish line Nov. 4 to see who wins off-year elections that are considered a signal for how 2026 campaigns will go.The voters need to choose between Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in polling , Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic former governor, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican founder of the anti-crime group Guardian Angels.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Indian time) warned he would restrict federal funds for New York City if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election.

Elon Musk has thrown his support behind Andrew Cuomo in New York City’s heated mayoral race and advised New Yorkers to not go for the 'socialist' Zohran Mamdani.In a post on X, the Tesla and SpaceX chief urged New Yorkers to “remember to vote tomorrow,” warning that “a vote for Curtis [Sliwa] is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is. ” He ended his post with a blunt message: “VOTE CUOMO!”The endorsement aligns Musk with several billionaire figures who have rallied against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, including Mike Bloomberg, Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.US President Donald Trump also said he preferred Cuomo, calling him the “lesser evil” compared to Mamdani in a CBS 60 Minutes interview. The MAGA chief said he would rather have Cuomo — whom he called a “bad Democrat” — as New York City’s mayor than a “communist,” referring to Mamdani.Zohran Mamdani is a progressive state assemblyman from Queens who has built his campaign on taxing the ultra-rich and expanding affordable housing. He wants stronger unions, public housing for all, and climate policies that put working people first. Mamdani has support from left-wing groups like the Democratic Socialists of America but is strongly opposed by Wall Street, landlords, and tech billionaires who see his policies as hostile to business.Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, is pitching himself as a steady, experienced hand who can bring order back to New York City. His campaign focuses on fiscal discipline, safety, police force, and rebuilding trust with businesses. He says New York needs balance, not extremes. Backed by moderates and several major donors, Cuomo is trying to appeal to voters tired of political fights and economic uncertainty.Curtis Sliwa, the Republican and founder of the Guardian Angels, is running on a law-and-order message. Known for his red beret and street patrols, Sliwa promises to clean up the subways, fight crime, and deal with homelessness. His focus is public safety above all. Supporters see him as tough and honest, while critics say his plans are short on details and rely too much on fear of rising crime.","The Tesla and SpaceX chief urged New Yorkers to “remember to vote tomorrow,” warning that “a vote for Curtis [Sliwa] is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is. ” He ended his post with a blunt message: “VOTE CUOMO!”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125068746,imgsize-596859,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"English test crackdown bars over 7,000 truckers across US; Indian-origin drivers among most affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/english-test-crackdown-bars-over-7000-truckers-across-us-indian-origin-drivers-among-most-affected/articleshow/125067978.cms,"From Tragedy To Target: Indian Truckers Face Backlash in United States After Deadly Florida Crash





Harjinder Singh truck crash



Over $40 million lost



What do experts say?



Loss of jobs for immigrant drivers







Thousands of truck drivers across the United States have been barred from operating after failing newly enforced English proficiency tests, with Indian-origin and Latino drivers among those most affected.The rule, reinstated under Donald Trump’s administration, has raised alarm among trucking companies and worker groups, who say it unfairly targets immigrant drivers. It could worsen the ongoing truck driver shortage.Since June, more than 6,000 commercial truckers have been taken off the road for failing roadside English-language checks, according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) data.FreightWaves, a transport and logistics outlet, reported that at least 5,006 “English language-related out-of-service violations” were recorded through October, a number that continues to climb as states increase enforcementLast week, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy, in a post on X, said that ""7248 drivers placed out of service for failing to meet Trump's English language proficiency standards as of October 2025.""""US department of transport requires commercial truck drivers to speak and understand English to operate a big rig- or they will be taken out of service,"" Duffy added.The stricter enforcement followed several fatal road incidents, including a crash in Florida that killed three people.The driver, Harjinder Singh, 28, originally from India, failed an English proficiency assessment after the accident, answering only two of twelve questions correctly. He has pleaded not guilty to vehicular homicide charges.The Department of Transportation announced that California would lose over $40 million in federal funding for refusing to comply with the rule.“California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement,” said Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy. The rule was reinstated in May under Trump’s executive order, which mandates that commercial drivers must demonstrate sufficient English skills to read road signs, converse with the public, and communicate with officials.While federal officials argue the policy improves safety, industry experts say there is no data linking English proficiency with accident rates. “English proficiency is such a subjective standard,” said Brandon Wiseman, president of Trucksafe Consulting. “What one officer might think is proficient, another officer down the road might think is not proficient. That makes it tough.”Drivers and trucking companies are not happy over the lack of clarity and fairness in the testing process. “It’s going to cause a lot of singling out of Mexican individuals or individuals of Hispanic heritage, and maybe stereotyping,” said Adalberto Campero, CEO of Texas-based Unimex. “Drivers are scared now. They’re threatened, they’re intimidated because they feel like their livelihood could be taken away.”Several industry schools are now preparing drivers for roadside English checks. Eli Soler, who runs a Miami-based commercial driving school, said he has added mock English tests to his classes. “This is an industry that requires both skills, the English to communicate and the proficiency to drive equipment,” he said.The enforcement has also raised fears of job losses, particularly among older or immigrant drivers. “A big chunk of the industry is made up of Latino drivers who work really hard and safely, even if their English isn’t perfect,” said David Sanchez, a Texas-based driver. “The young people are going to learn English pretty quick, but there are a lot of older drivers who are probably going to lose their job.”According to the FMCSA, about 3.8 per cent of licensed commercial drivers have limited English proficiency.Critics argue the new rule is part of a broader political agenda. The Sikh Coalition called the policy “an effort to remove approximately 194,000 non-domiciled drivers from the workforce,” saying it unfairly targets immigrants rather than addressing genuine safety concerns.Despite the backlash, Secretary Duffy defended the enforcement, saying, “Americans are a lot safer on roads alongside truckers who can understand and interpret our traffic signs.""","Since June, more than 6,000 commercial truckers have been taken off the road for failing roadside English-language checks.

The wife of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani , Rama Duwaji, chose to skip her husband's debate, making it no surprise that she would remain absent from the entire campaign of Mamdani but it was a conscious decision to remain in the background and do her own thing when her husband does his own thing. The 28-year-old artist did not make any social media posts seeking votes for her husband, did not do any joint television appearances or agree to do any magazine profile.But she accompanied Mamdani to Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' to sit in the crowd alongside more than 10,000 people.

'What The Hell Are You Doing?': Obama Talks MAGA, Then Torches 'CLUELESS' Trump





Former First Lady Michelle Obama complained how she had to navigate 'white hot glare' as a Black First Lady as she was discussing her new book 'The Look' on ABC News. “We were all too aware that as a first black couple, we couldn’t afford any missteps. And that as a black woman, I was under a particularly white hot glare,” Michelle wrote in her book.During the interview, when she was asked particularly about her phrase 'white hot glare', Michelle Obama said, ""You can't afford to get anything wrong because you didn't get the ...at least until the country came to know us, we didn't get the grace that I think some other families have gotten.""“Making a mistake in a political environment where you’re the first and people are where your opponents are using your race as a fear-based strategy to make you seem like the other, then everything matters,” she said.The Look is co-authored by Michelle with her stylist and speaks about Michelle's fashion choices. She said she was apprehensive about discussing fashion when she was the First Lady and there were more important things at that time but now that the public knows her and her work, she feels comfortable speaking about the 'soft power'.“We live in a culture, sadly, where, you know, if somebody wants to go after a woman, the first thing they do is go after our looks, our size, our physical being, as a way to, you know, make us feel small, to keep us in place,” Michelle said.But her complaint did not go down well with social media users who pointed out that the Obamas have been the most celebrated First Family and Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue thrice.""I am sad to announce that we have once again disappointed the Obamas,"" one wrote.

73-page criminal complaint filed against two







A Michigan defense lawyer has claimed that FBI director Kash Patel's statement that the FBI foiled an ISIS-style attack planned on Halloween weekend was inflated and that there was no such plan. Dearborn's Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud have been charged with receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition, knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a federal crime of terrorism.Ali's lawyer Amir Makled said his client in a 20-year-old US citizen with a lawful interest in recreational firearms. ""There is no evidence whatsoever of a planned terror or ‘mass casualty’ plot,” Makled said, adding that the federal authorities have not given him many details about the investigation and he concluded that there was no terror event planned. “I don’t know where this hysteria and this fearmongering came from,” Makled said.Five people were arrested in connection with the foiled terror plan bit only two have been charged in the 73-page criminal complaint. Ali and an unnamed juvenile were referenced in third-party communications from July to October of this year. The conversations stated that the ""brothers"" were planning to conduct an attack on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group.Ali allegedly purchased a shotgun, AR-15-style rifle and other firearm accessories in August and September, the same time the third-party conversations referred to an attack, according to the complaint.Mahmoud allegedly also purchased an AR-15-style rifle in September and then bought more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition a month later, according to the complaint.One of the alleged co-conspirators had his phone reviewed by a Customs and Border Patrol agent upon his return to the U.S. in August, the complaint said. The man had Google searches for ""ISIS,"" the ""Islamic State,"" and pictures of ""military-style clothing with weapons,"" the complaint said.According to the complaint, a different co-conspirator discussed traveling to Syria to join ISIS and had tried to convince ""Athari"" and ""Bukhari"" to join them. Investigators believe those names were used to reference Ali and the unidentified juvenile.Federal agents recovered AR-15-style rifles, two shotguns, four handguns and ammunition in addition to tactical vests and GoPro cameras at Ali and Mahmoud's residence, according to the complaint. Agents also seized two tactical backpacks, chest-rig vests and 24 empty magazines at a storage unit allegedly rented by Ali.","Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud have been charged with receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition.

Viral video of woman in bikini dancing in giant Martini glass at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago party stirs row: ‘Full Epstein Island vibes’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/viral-video-of-woman-in-bikini-dancing-in-giant-martini-glass-at-trumps-mar-a-lago-party-stirs-row-full-epstein-island-vibes/articleshow/125063207.cms,"Democrats slam the lavish party



End of SNAP benefits



Who was invited to the party?







A video of half-naked dancers performing inside a giant martini glass at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Halloween party stirred a row online, with netziens accusing the US president of being “tone deaf” as millions of Americans lost food aid during the ongoing government shutdown.Internet compared the scene to ""Epstein Island,” as, just like the late paedophile, the party also seemed to have similar vibes of wealth, secrecy, and moral decay. Social media compared the extravagant Mar-a-Lago bash to the kind of elite gatherings once linked to Jeffrey Epstein — lavish on the surface but unsettling in tone.One viral video showed a woman in a white bikini swirling inside a massive champagne glass, draped in a feather boa as guests cheered. Another showed a performer surrounded by glittering decorations and a massive ice sculpture chilling alcohol.California governor Gavin Newsom blasted the event, writing, “Donald Trump hosted a Great Gatsby party while Snap benefits were about to disappear for 42 million Americans. He does not give a damn about you.” Senator Chris Murphy also weighed in, saying, “The way he rubs his inhumanity in Americans’ face never ceases to stun me.He’s illegally refusing to pay food stamp benefits while he throws a ridiculously over-the-top Gatsby party for his Right-wing millionaire and corporate friends. ”The party came just hours after federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) officially ended, affecting millions of families who depend on food benefits. Two federal judges later ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay for the programme.The government shutdown has left around 1.4 million federal employees without pay.Among the party guests were Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, Jared Kushner, Michael Boulos, and secretary of state Marco Rubio.The party was held at Trump’s Palm Beach resort in Florida and was themed “A little party never killed nobody,” a nod to the 2013 film The Great Gatsby, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel about greed and excess.Guests were dressed in flashy 1920s outfits as champagne flowed and flapper dancers performed for the crowd.Trump brushed off backlash during a media interaction before the party, saying the situation was “so easily solved” and blaming Democrats for the shutdown. “We have tremendous support, but it’s not even support, it’s common sense. Open up the country,” he said.The backlash comes just days after Trump unveiled renovations at the White House, including turning part of the East Wing into a ballroom and replacing the Lincoln Bathroom’s historic tiles with white marble.Polls show that most Americans blame the Trump administration for the shutdown, reports the Telegraph. His approval rating has dropped to -18 per cent in the latest Economist average, lower than Joe Biden’s at the same stage of his presidency.","Internet compared the scene to ""Epstein Island,” as, just like the late paedophile, the party also seemed to have similar vibes of wealth, secrecy, and moral decay.
