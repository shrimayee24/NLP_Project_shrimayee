NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed that it was ""disturbed"" by the chaos at Calcutta high court on January 9 which led to the adjournment of the hearing on ED plea against Mamata Banerjee government over I-PAC raids. Reacting to the central agency's charge that TMC ""instructed"" people to go to the HC, SC remarked whether it was a protest site like Jantar Mantar.""Kindly see what happened in this case. We approached the (Calcutta) High Court. This is what happens when mobocracy replaces democracy. This is what the high court records.

This was not spontaneous and they were instructed by the legal cell of the party to go there,"" PTI quoted SG Tushar Mehta saying.""Come everyone? As if it's Jantar Mantar!"", remarked Justice Mishra.The SG pointed out that ""buses and vehicles"" had allegedly been arranged to ferry people to HC on January 9. He further said that prior to yesterday’s hearing, the acting chief justice had issued an administrative order restricting the entry of unauthorised persons into the courtroom.""The proceeding was live-streamed and the hearing was less than satisfactory. ED faced many difficulties and the microphone was constantly muted,"" Mehta said.As advocate Kapil Sibal commenced his submissions on behalf of Mamata, the bench observed that the incidents that unfolded in the Calcutta HC were disturbing. ""We are disturbed by the manner in which the hearing in the High Court was last week adjourned due to commotion,"" Justice Mishra said.When the SG suggested that the gathering in the courtroom may have been intentional or unintentional, the judge responded, ""intentional or not, the high court has recorded something"", pointing to the fact that the high court itself had adjourned the matter after recording the reason as commotion.Calcutta HC proceedings were adjourned on January 9 after chaos disrupted the hearing in the ED–I-PAC matter and the Trinamool Congress’s counter-petition.The top court termed the ED’s allegation that Mamata obstructed its investigation as “very serious” and said it would examine whether state authorities can interfere with probes conducted by central agencies in serious cases. The court stayed the FIR filed by West Bengal police against ED officials and ordered that CCTV footage of the January 8 raids be preserved.The ED approached the top court after its officers allegedly faced resistance during searches at the I-PAC office and the residence of its director, Pratik Jain, in a coal smuggling case. While the ED claimed Banerjee entered the premises and took away “key” evidence, the chief minister and the TMC denied the charge and accused the agency of overreach.","Calcutta HC proceedings were adjourned on January 9 after chaos disrupted the hearing in the ED–I-PAC matter and the Trinamool Congress’s counter-petition.

JAMMU: Acting on court orders, Poonch Police attached the land of a Pakistan-based terror handler in the district’s Mandi tehsil, valued at more than Rs 22 lakh, on Thursday.The attachment was carried out in connection with an FIR registered at Mandi PS under Sections 2/3 of the Egress and Internal Movement (Control) Ordinance, 2005, the purpose of which is to control who can leave (egress) or move within the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir . The ordinance is used by law enforcement for cases involving alleged unlawful activities, such as individuals crossing borders for training or supporting anti-national actions.The land — spanning 10 kanals and 14 marlas — belonged to Abdul Aziz, a native of Chamber Kanari in Mandi, Poonch. He had earlier fled to Pakistan, from where he was currently operating as a terror handler. The fugitive has been actively involved in acts detrimental to India's security and sovereignty, a police spokesperson said.“Owing to his continued evasion of the legal process, the accused was declared a proclaimed offender by the court. Despite sustained efforts by Poonch Police to secure his arrest, he remained beyond the reach of law, compelling the court to order attachment of his immovable property,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said Poonch Police executed the court order in coordination with the revenue department, after following all due legal procedures, verification, and documentation.“The action is part of a broader and sustained strategy to dismantle the financial and logistical support structures of terror networks and to ensure that individuals involved in terrorism and anti-national activities are deprived of their resources,” the spokesperson said.","Poonch Police attached the land of a Pakistan-based terror handler in the district’s Mandi tehsil.

After Putin & Xi, Saudi, NATO Nation 'Back' Khamenei; Trump Gets Chilling Warning Against Iran 'War'

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah spoke on Thursday with external affairs minister S. Jaishankar on the situation in Iran and cited assurances that all steps will be taken for the safety of hundreds of students and others from J&K stranded in the protest-wracked country.J&K Students Association (JKSA) put the number of students in Iran at over 2000, 95% of them in medical courses. “He (Jaishankar) shared his assessment of the ground situation & the plans that the ministry is working on. I’m grateful for his assurance that all steps will be taken to safeguard the interests & lives of students & other people from J&K who are in Iran now,” Omar wrote on X.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti sought central intervention. “Thousands of students from across the country, including Kashmir, are stranded in Iran amid the present volatile situation.

NEW DELHI: Defence sources on Thursday told ANI that two incident of drone spotting were reported in the Jammu sector, marking third such incident in recent days. Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems measures were activated by the Indian Army following the sightings, the sources said.The latest sightings come on Army Day, as the Indian Army underlined its focus on future-ready capabilities and indigenous systems. Speaking after the Army Day parade in Jaipur, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said the Army is moving ahead with well-trained soldiers, modern equipment and multi-domain operational capabilities, with technology playing a key role in enhancing combat readiness.Referring to Operation Sindoor , General Dwivedi said it established a “new normal” by demonstrating the Army’s ability to respond with speed, coordination and precision. “The operation reflected a mature and confident force, capable of safeguarding national interests through measured, firm and responsible action,” he said.The drone sightings follow a series of similar incidents earlier this week along the Line of Control and the International Border in Jammu and Kashmir. On Tuesday, ANI sources said suspected Pakistani drones were sighted for the second time in 48 hours in areas along the LoC and the International Border, including Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts.Counter-UAS measures were deployed, and ground search operations were launched in several locations.In the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district, Army troops opened fire with medium and light machine guns after observing drone movement over Gania-Kalsian village around 6.35 pm, officials said.

Similar activity was reported in the Mankote sector of Poonch district.The heightened alert along the border comes amid a strong warning from General Dwivedi to Pakistan over active terror camps across the LoC and the International Border. “At least 6 terror camps still active across the LoC & 2 across the International Border after Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Will act, if any (nefarious) attempts are carried out,” the Army chief said during the Army Day press conference.","Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems measures were activated by the Indian Army following the sightings.

ho said what?

ED's allegations against Mamata

Appearing before the bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Vipul Pancholi, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta accused Mamata of ""barging in and interfered"", ""whenever statutory authorities exercised statutory power.""

""It reflects a very shocking pattern,"" Mehta said.

""The states will feel they can barge in, commit theft, and then sit on a dharna. Let an example be set; officers who were explicitly present there should be suspended,"" Mehta added.

Mehta said that there was evidence indicating ""incriminating material"" was present at the premises searched during the I-PAC raid in Kolkata.

Further, he accused Mamata of entering the premises where the raid was ongoing and taking way ""key"" evidence related to the probe.

He said local police authorities had been duly informed in advance and that senior officials, including the DGP, the CM, the commissioner of police, the local deputy commissioner of police (DCP), and a large police force, subsequently reached the spot.

""There was evidence leading to the conclusion that incriminating material was lying in a premise...local police was intimated...DGP, CM and Commissioner of Police and DCP of area, large police force, goes there...took material unauthorizedly. It's an offense of THEFT. She takes it away. Mobile of ED official also taken away. She even went before media...this will encourage officers to not discharge their duty. Forces will be demoralized. Let example be set. Officers who were present during exercise be placed under suspension and placed under departmental enquiry. Please take cognizance of what's happening,"" Mehta said.

Ma

mata's counter allegations

Appearing in behalf of Trinamool Congress chairman Mamata Banerjee, senior advocate Kapil Sibal submitted that the high court must first hear the matter and deliver its judgment, after which the parties could approach the appellate forum.

He argued that parallel proceedings had now been initiated, even though the High Court had jurisdiction under Article 226, and that this was the proper hierarchy to be followed.

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal said that IPAC had a large amount of party data, and when the ED went there, it knew that sensitive party information would be present.

Sibal also referred to the video recording of the raid and said, ""It is a blatant lie that all digital devices were taken. Allegation that CM Mamata Banerjee took all devices is a lie, substantiated by ED's own panchnama (search record).""

""The last statement in the coal scam was recorded in February 2024; what was ED doing since then? Why so keen in the midst of elections?"" he posed.

Meanwhile, senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the State and the DGP, raised a strong objection to the maintainability of the petition.

He submitted that if notice was to be issued, it should be made clear that it would be subject to their objection on maintainability.

Singhvi argued that a direct approach to the Supreme Court by the ED was permissible only in exceptional situations where no effective remedy was available. He also objected to forum shopping, pointing out that broadly similar reliefs had already been sought before the high court.

Senior Advocate Abhishek Singhvi argued that either the allegations made in the plea were incorrect or the panchnama itself was false, as both could not stand together

He said that claims of obstruction and inability to conduct the search were untrue in light of the panchnama. Referring to the Solicitor General’s statement that the authorities were informed, Singhvi contended that the State received only a casual email at around 11:30 am, even though the search had begun at 6:45 am. He urged the ED to place clear instructions on record and alleged that the exercise was merely an attempt to cover tracks and create a paper trail.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other state officials on the allegations levelled by Enforcement Directorate over the raids on I-PAC -- a political consultancy firm linked to Trinamool CongressThe top court sought the response from chief minister within two weeks.The bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Vipul Pancholi also restrained West Bengal Police from conducting probe on FIR registered against ED and its officials.“Issue notice to the respondents. Counter affidavit be filed within two weeks. Post the matter on February 3, 2026. In the meanwhile it is directed that, the respondents (West Bengal government) shall preserve the CCTV cameras at I-PAC and other cameras containing the footage of nearby areas,"" the bench said.The bench also reacted to the Calcutta HC chaos on January 9 that led to the adjournment of the court. It said that it was “disturbed” by the commotion at the HC that resulted in the adjournment of the hearing on the ED’s plea against the Mamata Banerjee government over the I-PAC raids. Responding to the ED’s allegation that the TMC had “instructed” people to assemble at the high court, the apex court questioned whether the courtroom had been turned into a protest venue like Jantar Mantar.“Come everyone? As if it’s Jantar Mantar!”, Justice Mishra remarked.This comes following the central agency's raid on I-PAC and its chief Pratik Jain at Kolkata's Salt Lake on January 8.The ED alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee interfered during the raids, removed digital devices and key documents with police support, and forced officials to terminate the searches without making any seizures.","Solicitor General Tushar Mehta accused Mamata Banerjee of ""barging in and interfering"" He said there was evidence indicating ""incriminating material"" was present at the premises searched during the I-PAC raid in Kolkata.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126542882,imgsize-1301297,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

SRINAGAR/LUCKNOW: Ladakh and UP saw a coordinated surge of pro-Iran sentiment as thousands rallied in Kargil district Wednesday and prominent Shia clerics in Lucknow called for sanctions relief, dialogue and Indian support for Tehran.In Kargil, a Shia-majority district in eastern Ladakh bordering PoK, large crowds gathered at multiple locations to back Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and denounce the US and Israel. The rally, organised by Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, was led by chairman Sheikh Sadiq Rajai, who accused Washington and Tel Aviv of seeking to dominate the region and destabilise Iran.“We have come out to protest against America and to stand with the brave people of Iran,” Rajai said, urging Islamic nations to unite against what he called US “evil designs”.Demonstrators waved banners praising Ruhollah Khomeini and Khamenei and shouted slogans in Persian and Urdu, while shouting “down with America” and “down with Israel”. Several women addressed the gathering. Police and paramilitary forces were deployed. Officials said protests remained peaceful and also took place in some blocks Thursday.Asgar Ali Karbali, a senior community activist in Ladakh, said Iran has long supported oppressed communities from Lebanon to Palestine.“With this huge protest in Kargil today, we want to show that Iran is not alone,” he said.On Thursday, Shia clerics and community figures in UP echoed support for Tehran and warned against escalation.Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, a leading cleric in Lucknow, said Western sanctions have crippled Iran’s economy and created unrest. “On allegations of uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons, Western powers imposed sanctions on a Shia country. But in reality, they want Iran’s oil… Remove the sanctions, and Iran will flourish,” he said, urging New Delhi to back Tehran rather than remain neutral.Maulana Yasoob Abbas of All India Shia Personal Law Board accused the US and Israel of fuelling unrest and dismissed reports of mass casualties, saying life in Iran was normal. Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, chairman of Islamic Centre of India and Shahi Imam of Lucknow, said war was no solution and called on the UN to intervene, stressing Iran’s sovereignty and historic ties with India.From Kintoor village in Barabanki district — about 30km southeast of Lucknow and ancestral home of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s grandfather — Dr Rehan Kazmi said Western media was distorting events, citing family contacts in Iran who reported large pro-govt rallies.“If Israel or the US attacks, Iran will respond strongly. They have been prepared for this for the past 20 years,” Kazmi said.","Ladakh and UP saw a coordinated surge of pro-Iran sentiment as thousands rallied in Kargil district Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Asiya Andrabi, the founder of women separatist outfit Dukhtaran-E-Millat (DeM), and her associates, Sofi Fehmeeda and Nahida Nasreen, did not bear an allegiance to the Constitution of India and actively worked for Kashmir's secession, a Delhi court said while convicting the trio for waging war against the country and other charges under UAPA and IPC on Wednesday.In his detailed order, which was made available Thursday, NIA court judge Chander Jit Singh noted that the accused were ""vociferously"" seeking Kashmir's separation from India on religious grounds, striking at the idea of national integrity. Their consistent calls for secession of an integral part of India amounted to a complete ""rejection of India's constitutional framework"", he added.The court cited instances where Andrabi sought support from Pak-based platforms and referred to a 2018 interview in which she stated that ""gun is a must"" for a referendum. The court said such statements went beyond political dissent and reflected endorsement of violent means to achieve secession.On defence's claim of right to self-determination based on UN resolutions, court flagged a clear contradiction. It noted that while the accused claimed such a right, they simultaneously asserted that Kashmir was part of Pakistan and under ""illegal occupation"" by India.","Asiya Andrabi, the founder of women separatist outfit Dukhtaran-E-Millat (DeM), and her associates, Sofi Fehmeeda and Nahida Nasreen, did not bear an allegiance to the Constitution of India.

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, ED Thursday moved SC seeking to implead Union home ministry and DoPT (department of personnel & training) in its ongoing legal battle with Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over her alleged attempt to foil ED's search operation against I-PAC in Kolkata in a coal 'scam' case.ED's fresh appeal comes at a time when the agency is checking the veracity of reports that WB chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty was among the officials accompanying the CM when she rushed to political consultancy firm I-PAC chief Pratik Jain's residence when the central agency's search was underway.The development coincided with SC taking up ED's criminal writ petition for hearing and issuing notice to the CM and top state officials, including Bengal DGP Rajeev Kumar. SC termed the incident of disruption of ED's Jan 8 search proceedings as ""serious"" and promised to look into the larger issue of state agencies interfering in actions of central agencies.Bengal govt's response - to ED's fresh, or additional, appeal - will be worth watching if reports are confirmed, and if ED, as indications are, brings it to the notice of SC during the next hearing on the matter. The state has justified DGP Kumar accompanying Mamata to Jain's residence by saying that the CM was a 'Z-category protectee'.In its additional appeal Thursday, ED sought ""impleadment of proposed respondents 7-9"" as party respondents in present criminal writ petition, failing which, it said, the agency ""shall suffer irreparable loss and injury"".Respondent No. 7 is DoPT through its secretary, respondent No. 8 is home ministry through its secretary, and respondent No. 9 is State of WB through its chief secretary.CM Mamata has been made respondent No. 2 in ED's criminal petition before SC; DGP Kumar is respondent No. 3; Kolkata police Commissioner Manoj Verma is respondent No 4; Priyabrata Roy, DCP South Kolkata, is respondent No. 5; and CBI is respondent No. 6.ED argued that respondents 7-9 ""are necessary/proper parties in the present matter"" to initiate actions against the erring senior police officers, who were allegedly party to the disruption of ED's search proceedings.""That it is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this court may be pleased to implead proposed respondents 7 to 9 as party respondents in present writ petition (criminal), failing which the petitioner shall suffer irreparable loss and injury,"" ED said.ED sought SC directions to respondents ""herein, i.e. to initiate departmental inquiry/proceedings for major penalty against respondents 3-5 along with other police officials and to place the said respondents No. 3-5 with other police officials under suspension"".This is not the first time that Kumar has been entangled in a legal battle with central agencies. In 2019, when he was Kolkata police commissioner, CBI had reached his residence to question him in a chit fund 'scam' case.The state police team detained CBI officers, leading to agency approaching courts for seeking action against the top cop and other officers. Kumar obtained anticipatory bail, which was later challenged by CBI before the SC.",ED moves SC seeking to implead Union home ministry and DoPT in its ongoing legal battle with Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.

NEW DELHI: Terming the clash between Enforcement Directorate (ED) and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee as very serious, with wider implications, Supreme Court Thursday issued notice to the CM and state officials on the central agency's plea to initiate action against them for preventing it from discharging its duty in the alleged coal scam case.The court granted them two weeks to file responses and stayed the FIR registered by the West Bengal police against ED officials.""We are of the prima facie opinion that the present petition has raised a serious issue related to the investigation by ED or other central agencies and its interference by state agencies,"" a bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Vipul M Pancholi said.""According to us, for furtherance of rule of law in the country, and to allow each organ to function independently, it is necessary to examine the issue so that the offenders are not allowed to be protected under the shield of the law enforcement agencies of a particular state,"" the bench said. The same situation could crop up in other states if these issues remained undecided, it said.The outcome of this litigation would assume significance as clashes between Centre and opposition-governed states have become frequent, with the state blaming Centre for using its agencies, particularly CBI and ED, for political purposes and the Centre accusing the states for protecting their corrupt ministers and officials by not allowing its probe agency to function.It said, ""The larger questions involved in the present manner, which if allowed to remain undecided, would further worsen the situation and there will be a situation of lawlessness prevailing in one or the other state, considering that different political outfits are governing different places."" ""True that any central agency does not have any power to interfere with election work of any party. But if central agency is bona fide investigating any serious offence, the question arises whether in the guise of taking shield of party activities, agencies can be restricted from carrying out duties,"" the SC said.The bench, at the outset, raised the question of maintainability of Enforcement Directorate's writ petition. But it made up its mind to examine the petition after solicitor general Tushar Mehta explained how the incident took place and the manner in which Calcutta high court was prevented from hearing its plea on the first date. ""This is serious and we have to examine it,"" the bench said after SG Mehta's argument.Mehta, also flanked by additional solicitors general S V Raju and Vikramajit Banerjee, told SC that the CM, along with senior state police officials, including the DGP, barged into the premises where ED was conducting its raid in an illegal coal mining 'scam' and took away evidence. He said the CM and state officials staged a dharna and prevented the agency from discharging its duty. ""If no action is taken then the central force would get demoralised. .. Let erring officers be put on suspension to set an example that they cannot do dharna and block investigation,"" the SG said.Mehta informed the bench that this was not the first time that such an incident had taken place, and earlier, CBI officers were arrested by Bengal police after they went to question the then Kolkata police commissioner.ED's plea was strongly objected to by senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Shyam Diwan, appearing for the CM, the state and its officials, respectively. They submitted that ED's action was meant to disrupt the upcoming West Bengal assembly elections.Questioning the motive behind the raid of I-PAC premises, a political consultant of the Mamata-led TMC, Sibal, appearing for her, said, ""The first question which arises is why was there a need to go there in the midst of an election? The last statement in the coal mining scam was recorded in Feb 2024. What were they doing in 2024 and 2025, and why are they so keen in the midst of elections in 2026? If you get hold of the information, how will we fight the elections? This is why the party chairperson (Mamata) has the right to go there. It is the property of the party...It is a completely mala fide exercise by ED to disturb the election process by gathering confidential information.""Singhvi submitted that ED, which first moved the HC, is resorting to ""forum shopping"" by filing a case in SC. He said the issue could be examined in HC. As the bench raised the issue of commotion created in the high court on first hearing on Jan 9, Singhvi said emotions were running high on the first day but the hearing went on very smoothly on Wednesday. He further submitted that the entire search was done peacefully as as per the panchnama, which is diametrically opposite the contention raised in the petition. He said local police was initially in dark as the search operations started at 6am, and the email communication was sent only at 11.30am.The bench, after hearing both the sides, passed an order and also stayed FIR lodged by the state against ED officials and directed the police to preserve CCTV footage and other evidence.","The court granted them two weeks to file responses and stayed the FIR registered by the West Bengal police against ED officials.

US Senate Hearing Turns Viral After Indian-Origin Doctor Refuses Yes Or No On Men Getting Pregnant

Who is Dr Nisha Verma ?





Dr Nisha Verma has drawn national attention after a tense exchange during a recent US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on abortion pill safety.During the hearing, Republican Senator Josh Hawley repeatedly questioned Verma on whether men can get pregnant, a line of questioning that quickly went viral on social media and reignited wider political and cultural debates around gender identity, reproductive rights and the language used in healthcare.Verma, who appeared as a Democratic witness, declined to give a direct yes-or-no answer and described the questioning as “polarizing”, saying she treats patients “with many identities”. Hawley responded by asserting that “it is women who get pregnant, not men.”The exchange has since fuelled sharp reactions online and among policymakers, with the debate likely to shape future discussions on abortion policy, transgender healthcare and the regulation of medication abortion in the US.Dr Nisha Verma is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and a complex family planning subspecialist.She was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, to Indian immigrant parents.She completed her Bachelor’s degree in Biology and Anthropology and her medical degree at the University of North Carolina, and later earned a Master’s in Public Health from Emory University.She trained in obstetrics and gynaecology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and completed a Complex Family Planning Fellowship at Emory University.According to Emory University, she is an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Emory University School of Medicine.Dr Verma currently serves as Senior Advisor for Reproductive Health Policy and Advocacy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), as per AcademyHealth.She provides reproductive healthcare in states including Georgia and Maryland, has testified before Congress on abortion restrictions, and is involved in research examining the impact of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban on high-risk pregnancies.",Dr Nisha Verma has drawn national attention after a tense exchange during a recent US Senate hearing on abortion pill safety.

Iran reopens airspace

Is US really stepping back from targeting Iran?





The United States aircraft that were moved out of Al Udeid in Qatar on Wednesday were gradually returning to the base, Reuters reported.It also added that the security warning level at the US Al Udeid air base in Qatar was lowered after a heightened alert triggered on Wednesday, three sources briefed on the situation told Reuters.Reuters reported that some personnel who were advised to leave the base on Wednesday were also permitted to return.This came after Trump said he was told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after earlier threatening intervention.Earlier, Iran's foreign minister said Iran had ""no plan"" to hang people, and Iranian state media on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence.Rights organisation Hengaw, which reported earlier this week that Erfan Soltani was due to be executed on Wednesday, said a previously communicated order for his execution was postponed, citing his relatives.In a social media post on Thursday, Trump responded to a news report that an Iranian protester was no longer being sentenced to death, writing: ""This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!""Iran reopened its airspace shortly before 10 pm ET, or 0300 GMT, after a near-five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights.Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 5:15 pm ET (2215 GMT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website.

A fragile uprising — and a president watching closely

Why Iran is not Venezuela

The limits of US military power





US President Donald Trump has made clear to his national security team that if the United States strikes Iran, he wants it to be swift, decisive and regime-shaking, not a prolonged conflict that drags on for months, as per NBC news.According to US officials cited by NBC News, Trump has told advisers that any action must deliver a definitive blow. Yet his own defence and intelligence teams have so far been unable to guarantee that an American strike would collapse Iran’s leadership or avoid a wider regional war. That uncertainty has left the White House weighing limited options, even as Trump publicly signals support for protesters challenging Tehran’s rule.But behind the tough rhetoric and comparisons with this month’s dramatic seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro lies a far more complex reality. Iran’s military capabilities, regional footprint and internal dynamics make any “quick win” vastly harder to deliver.Iran has been rocked by its largest nationwide protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, driven initially by economic collapse and now fuelled by deep anger at the political system.Activists say at least 2,600 people have been killed and more than 18,000 arrested in a crackdown marked by internet blackouts, mass detentions and the threat of executions.Trump has repeatedly hinted at intervention. “Help is on the way,” he told Iranians this week, warning the regime it would “pay a big price” if killings continued. On Wednesday, however, he struck a more ambiguous tone, saying he had been told executions had stopped and that the situation would be “watched”.American personnel were repositioned from Qatar’s Al Udeid air base (but were later told to return).The recent US operation in Venezuela looms large over Trump’s thinking. That raid, which captured Maduro in under half an hour, relied on months of covert planning, overwhelming air superiority and the near-total failure of Venezuela’s air defences. Caracas’s systems — largely Russian-made and poorly maintained — were neutralised through electronic warfare and precision strikes, leaving the regime exposed.Iran presents an entirely different challenge. While its defences were badly damaged during Israel’s 12-day air campaign in June, Tehran has spent the past year rebuilding and upgrading its systems. It now operates a layered air defence network combining Russian S-300 and reportedly S-400 systems, China’s HQ-9B missiles, and indigenous platforms such as the Bavar-373, as per a report by the SOuth China Morning Post.Unlike Venezuela, Iran’s air defences are networked, mobile and designed to survive sustained attack. The HQ-9B alone has a range of around 300 kilometres and speeds exceeding Mach 4. Russia’s S-400 extends that range even further. Tehran has also reduced its reliance on foreign maintenance by expanding domestic production — a vulnerability that crippled Caracas.Any attempt to replicate a Venezuela-style leadership strike would therefore face far higher risks, including aircraft losses, misidentification of civilian targets and rapid escalation.Even if Trump authorised air or missile strikes, the US lacks the forward posture it would normally rely on for a major operation. There are currently no American aircraft carriers deployed in the Middle East although USS Abraham Lincoln has reportedly been deployed.According to News Nation, citing sources, the carrier strike group — built around USS Lincoln is backed by several warships, including at least one attack submarine — is expected to take about a week to reach the region.Any strikes would likely depend on regional airbases in Qatar, Bahrain, Iraq, the UAE or Saudi Arabia — all of which would immediately become potential Iranian targets.Long-range bombing missions, such as the B-2 strikes used against Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, remain an option. But using such firepower against urban or political targets would carry an obvious risk of civilian casualties and international backlash.There is also the question of what, precisely, would be bombed. Protests and repression are spread across Iran’s cities, not concentrated in a single command centre. Targeting military or intelligence facilities would not necessarily weaken the regime’s grip on the streets — and could instead allow Tehran to rally nationalist support against foreign aggression.Crucially, Iran retains a formidable missile arsenal. Despite losses, it is believed to possess around 2,000 ballistic missiles, many hidden in hardened mountain sites. A large-scale launch could overwhelm even advanced US and Israeli defences, threatening bases, ships and civilian infrastructure across the region.Although, the United States may have seemingly tempered down its stance as suggested by Iran’s ambassador to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam. As per the envoy, Trump has assured Tehran he does not intend to attack Iran and has urged restraint, as reported by Dawn.The envoy said Iran remained on high alert, had temporarily closed its airspace and was prepared to respond to any aggression. Tehran, he added, remained committed to peace.In Iran, “help” may be far more complicated — and dangerous — than Trump suggests.","Trump has told advisers that any action must deliver a definitive blow. But his own defence and intelligence teams have so far been unable to guarantee that an American strike would collapse Iran’s leadership. That uncertainty has left the White House weighing limited options, even as Trump publicly signals support for protesters challenging Tehran's rule.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126546691,imgsize-931441,width-400,resizemode-4/126546691.jpg"

Republican Representative Thomas Massie mocked President Donald Trump after posting on X that if Denmark told the GOP administration the Jeffrey Epstein files were in Greenland, “they’ll lose all interest and will never be able to find it. ”The comment came as US and Danish officials met in Washington to discuss Trump’s push for influence over the Arctic territory.The US has shown increased interest in Greenland, with Trump saying the island is “vital for national security” and claiming the United States “needs Greenland” to counter influence from Russia and China. Denmark and Greenland have consistently rejected any suggestion of a sale or change in sovereignty, saying that Greenland “chooses Denmark.”On Wednesday, US secretary of state Marco Rubio and vice‑president JD Vance met Danish and Greenlandic officials. According to Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the discussions were “frank but constructive,” and both sides agreed to form a high‑level working group to explore security concerns while respecting Danish sovereignty.Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna have jointly called for the public release of all Jeffrey Epstein documents held by federal courts, including deposition transcripts, flight logs and material from civil lawsuits and criminal investigations.The lawmakers argue that making the materials public could shed light on alleged crimes and potential misconduct by high‑profile individuals, especially in the MAGA base. Courts have resisted full disclosure, citing privacy concerns of victims and ongoing legal matters, and lawmakers have urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the documents for possible declassification.Trump’s name has appeared in some publicly released Epstein files, including flight logs from the 1990s and restored photos in a Justice Department database. Being referenced in the records does not indicate wrongdoing, and the DOJ has said sensational claims against Trump in the files are “unfounded and false.” Trump has said he cut ties with Epstein years before the financier’s 2019 arrest.

Can a Nobel Prize be transferred or shared?



No.

What Nobel Peace Centre says



So what did Machado actually give Trump?



Can the medal be sold?



Could Trump sell this medal?

Why does this matter?



The bottom line



Trump did not win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Machado cannot give him the title or the honour.

The medal itself can change hands and even be sold.

None of this alters who the Nobel Committee recognises as the laureate.





When Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado handed US President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal this week, the gesture was heavy on symbolism and light on clarity. Was Trump being “given” a Nobel? Can such a prize be passed on? And what exactly does ownership of the medal mean?Here is how the rules, precedents and the Nobel establishment itself explain it.Machado presented Trump with the medal she received after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year. Trump publicly praised her, calling her a “wonderful woman”, and described the act as one of mutual respect. The White House later confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.The timing was politically loaded. The meeting came days after US military action in Venezuela led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. While the intervention briefly elevated Machado’s profile as a leading opposition figure, Trump soon distanced himself from backing her as Venezuela’s future leader, citing doubts about her domestic support.The Nobel Peace Prize itself cannot be transferred, shared, reassigned or revoked.The status of Nobel laureate is personal and permanent. Machado remains the sole winner of the prize regardless of who physically holds the medal.Trump holding the medal does not make him a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, nor does it associate him formally with the award.The Nobel Peace Center has directly addressed the confusion around Nobel medals and ownership. In a post explaining the medal’s history and symbolism, the Centre noted that the Nobel Peace Prize medal measures 6.6 cm in diameter, weighs 196 grams, and is struck in gold. One side bears a portrait of Alfred Nobel, while the reverse shows three naked men holding each other’s shoulders as a symbol of brotherhood, a design unchanged for 120 years.Crucially, the Centre clarified that Nobel medals have, on several occasions, changed hands after being awarded. One prominent example is journalist Dmitry Muratov’s medal, which was auctioned for more than $100 million to support refugees from the war in Ukraine. Another detail often overlooked is that the medal displayed at the Nobel Peace Center itself is on loan and originally belonged to Christian Lous Lange, Norway’s first Peace Prize laureate.However, the Centre underlined a non-negotiable principle set by the Norwegian Nobel Committee: once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred. That decision stands for all time. A medal can change owners, but the title of Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.She gave him the physical medal, not the prize.Once awarded, the medal becomes the personal property of the laureate. While the honour and title are non-transferable, the object itself can be gifted, loaned or displayed by someone else. That distinction explains why Machado’s gesture is legally possible but institutionally meaningless.Yes, at least in principle.Several Nobel Peace Prize medals have been sold at auction over the years, sometimes for extraordinary sums. Prices vary widely depending on the individual and the context, with the most prominent sales usually framed as charitable acts rather than personal profit.Modern Nobel medals are made from 18-carat recycled gold, giving them intrinsic material value alongside their symbolic importance. But selling the medal does not transfer Nobel status. Buyers acquire a historical artefact, not the honour itself.That remains unclear. If the medal was gifted without restrictions, Trump could theoretically sell it as personal property. But such a move would almost certainly provoke political and ethical backlash. Previous high-profile sales were tied to humanitarian causes, not personal enrichment.There is also lingering uncertainty over whether the medal presented to Trump was the original Nobel medal or a symbolic presentation copy, a detail that has not been publicly clarified.Because Trump has long expressed frustration at never receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, often arguing that his diplomatic efforts were overlooked. Machado’s gesture tapped directly into that grievance, turning the Nobel into a piece of political theatre at a volatile geopolitical moment.Ergo, Trump can be handed the Nobel Peace Prize by Machado but in the eyes of the Nobel Committee, Machado remains the recipent.","Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado handed US President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal this week.

"Maharashtra civic body polls: Navi Mumbai leads in MMR with 57% turnout, Thane at 54%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-civic-body-polls-navi-mumbai-leads-in-mmr-with-57-turnout-thane-at-54/articleshow/126556914.cms,"





MUMBAI: The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NNMC) and Panvel recorded the highest voter turnout — an estimated 58% — in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) even as confusion over missing voter names were reported across the region. In the last NNMC elections, held a decade ago in 2015, the turnout was much lower at 49%.Several other MMR corporations, including Vasai-Virar and Kalyan-Dombivli, also saw slightly higher turnouts than previous civic polls, according to estimates provided Thursday night. However, Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar appeared to see reduced turnout.In Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s bastion of Thane, turnout was around 54%. But polling across several wards in that city was marred by allegations of bogus voting, delays and technical glitches. Complaints about missing names from electoral rolls, changes in polling stations, difficulty in navigating the multi-panel voting system and snags in electronic voting machines were reported throughout the day. Several voters said they left the booths without casting their ballots due to delays.Thane voters also complained about the quality of the ‘indelible ink’, which they said could be wiped off with plain water or spit. Elsewhere, voters alleged that buttons corresponding to candidates, particularly independents and Shiv Sena rebels, were not functioning at a few booths. In Naupada, independent candidate Kiran Nakti said he verified such complaints after supporters alerted him. Similar grievances were raised by a Sena rebel in Ward 4 and by the lone challenger to a Sena candidate in Vartak Nagar.In Kajuwada, polling was briefly halted after ballot units were found to be incorrectly arranged, resuming only after they were reset. Former mayor H.S. Patil said voting was suspended for nearly an hour in Nalpada after residents complained of bogus voting. Voter D Shetty from Louiswadi also complained of someone else voting in his name.Voter turnout was relatively low until early afternoon in Kalyan-Dombivli (KDMC), Ulhasnagar, and Bhiwandi-Nizampur municipal corporations, but later picked up. In KDMC, turnout was estimated at 52.11 % for the 122 seats, up three percent from 2015. To reduce long queues, the civic agency there had set up polling booths in schools as well as housing complex carparks.In KDMC Panel No. 29, extra police were deployed following clashes between workers of the competing BJP and Sena parties in recent days. Police were seen turning back vehicles reportedly coming from Badlapur to prevent any untoward incidents. Polling was peaceful.In Vasai-Virar, too, where turnout was 55%, there were complaints of bogus voting and EVM machines not working at some booths. Across Naigaon, Vasai, Nalasopara and Virar, several voters were unable to find their names on the electoral rolls, creating frustration. Similar issues were also reported by MiraBhayandar Municipal Corporation, where turnout was around 50%.In Virar East’s Shirgaon polling centre, EVMs were non-functional for about 30 minutes. Similar disruptions were reported at Tarkanagar in Vasai East (40 minutes), and Girij and Umelman in Vasai West, where EVMs reportedly remained non-functional for close to two hours. As a result, voters there faced long queues.Adding to the challenge, many had not received their voting slips, making it hard for them to locate their polling booths. In several cases, one family member found themselves registered to vote at one booth while other family members were assigned to another booth.","Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NNMC) and Panvel recorded the highest voter turnout — an estimated 58% — in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

Afghan man goes on trial over deadly Munich car-ramming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/afghan-man-goes-on-trial-over-deadly-munich-car-ramming/articleshow/126556652.cms,"Spate of attacks







MUNICH: An Afghan man goes on trial in Germany on Friday accused of ramming a car into a crowd in Munich last year, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother and injuring dozens.The suspect, partially identified as Farhad N., faces two charges of murder and 44 of attempted murder, with prosecutors saying he acted out of a ""religious motivation"" and expected to die in the attack.The vehicle rampage in February 2025 was one of several deadly attacks linked to migrants which inflamed a heated debate on immigration ahead of a general election that month.Farhad N, who was 24 at the time, is accused of deliberately steering his BMW Mini into a 1,400-strong trade union street rally in Munich on February 13.The vehicle came to a halt after 23 metres (75 feet) ""because its front wheels lost contact with the ground due to people lying in front of and underneath the car"", according to the charge sheet.A 37-year-old woman and her young daughter were both hurled through the air for 10 metres and sustained severe head injuries of which they died several days later.Prosecutors have said Kabul-born Farhad N. ""committed the act out of excessive religious motivation"", and that he had uttered the words ""Allahu Akbar"", meaning ""God is the greatest"", after the car rampage.""He believed he was obliged to attack and kill randomly selected people in Germany in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries,"" they said when he was charged in August.However, he is not believed to have been part of any Islamist militant movement such as the Islamic State group.Farhad N. arrived in Germany in 2016, at the height of the mass migrant influx to Europe. His asylum request was rejected but he was spared deportation, found work and was able to remain in the country.Police said Farhad N. worked in security and was heavily engaged in fitness training and bodybuilding.The Munich attack came a month after another Afghan man had carried out a knife attack on a kindergarten group that killed two people, including a two-year-old boy, in the city of Aschaffenburg.The perpetrator was later ordered to enter psychiatric care after judges found he had acted during an acute psychotic episode.In December 2024, six people were killed and hundreds wounded when a car ploughed into a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg. A Saudi man was arrested and is currently on trial.Several Syrian nationals were also arrested and charged with attacks or plots at around the same time, including a knife attack that killed three people at a street festival in the city of Solingen.Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis -- an influx that has proved deeply divisive and fuelled the rise of the far-right AfD.Conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who took power last May, has vowed to crack down on criminal migrants and has ramped up deportations of convicts to Afghanistan.Germany in December also deported a man to Syria for the first time since that country's civil war broke out in 2011.","Two-year-old girl and her mother killed after car ploughed into a crowd in Munich.

'Phase two' of Gaza ceasefire launched: Violations continue as US plan moves to next stage





US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) announced the formation of a Gaza board of peace, calling it a key step in the second phase of a US-backed plan aimed at ending the war in the Palestinian territory.In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the board as the “greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled”, without giving further details, adding that the names of board members would be revealed shortly.He wrote: ""It is my great honour to announce that the bard of peace has been formed. The members of the board will be announced shortly, but I can say with certainty that it is the greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled at any time, any place. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The announcement comes soon after the formation of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee. This committee has been tasked with handling the day-to-day administration of Gaza once the war ends. According to the plan, the committee will function under the supervision of the board of peace, which Trump is expected to chair.The broader proposal also includes the deployment of an international stabilisation force for maintaining security in Gaza and training selected Palestinian police units.The US-backed Gaza peace plan first took effect on October 10. It led to the return of all hostages held by Hamas and brought an end to active fighting in the besieged territory.

Jonvic Remulla says no anger toward Vitaly Zdorovetskiy as deportation moves forward





Russian streamer and YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy did not expect his online fame to end this way. The Russian-born YouTuber, known worldwide as Vitaly “VitalyzdTv” Zdorovetskiy, is now preparing to leave the Philippines and return to Russia after months of legal trouble.GMA News quoted Bureau of Immigration Legal Division chief Arvin Santos, who confirmed that a formal deportation order had already been issued after Vitaly Zdorovetskiy completed all court-required penalties and received clearances from the courts and the National Bureau of Investigation.Zdorovetskiy was arrested in April 2025 after a series of public incidents that caused concern across the country. Authorities said his actions included public disruption, theft, trespassing, and reckless driving. These incidents led to formal charges and court proceedings under Philippine law.In January 2026, immigration officials confirmed that Vitaly Zdorovetskiy had already served the required time of punishment for his criminal cases. After reviewing the court decisions, authorities moved forward with a deportation order. According to reports, he will be sent back to Russia, which is officially recognized as his home country.Speaking to GMA News, Bureau of Immigration Legal Division chief Arvin Santos explained that the process followed strict legal steps.“It is stated in our deportation order that his deportation is subject to clearances from the National Bureau of Investigation and from the courts where he had cases. His cases at the Taguig Regional Trial Court and the Metropolitan Trial Court have already been resolved, and the penalties imposed there are also considered served,” Santos said.Officials also noted that while his charges could have carried a sentence of up to about 18 months, his time in detention during investigations and legal processing was already counted.Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla addressed the issue to calm public concern and protect the country’s image among tourists. He made it clear that the Philippines remains open and welcoming, as long as visitors respect local laws.“We welcome visitors, but they are expected to follow the same rules,” Remulla said.He also stressed that there is no personal anger toward Zdorovetskiy and that the case was handled purely through legal channels.“We have no ill feelings against Vitaly. He has served his time and he has shown his remorse and he is now a free man when he goes back to Russia,” Remulla said.While Zdorovetskiy holds an American green card, officials clarified that he is legally considered a Russian citizen. Because of this, deportation to Russia was the correct legal outcome.Authorities also confirmed that he was not just held for immigration reasons, but was properly charged, tried, and processed through Philippine courts before the deportation order was approved.Also Read: “Secret Beekeeper Society”: Nick Fuentes Calls Candace Owens Claims Wild After Charlie Kirk Time Travel And Future Vision Talk","Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy faces possible deportation to Russia after Philippines arrest and court penalties.

Currency collapse sparked demonstrations





Iran on Thursday closed its airspace amid threats from US President Donald Trump over its crackdown on the protests which have rocked the Islamic Republic since the last two weeks.According to a New York Times report, more than 3,400 people have been killed in the demonstrations. The death toll included over 100 security personnel and thirteen childrenAdditionally, more than 18,400 people have been detained.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi rejected the claims of mass causalities and accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country.In an interview with the Fox News, Araghchi played down the death toll in his country and claimed that the number is in hundreds.""When terrorist elements led from outside, entered this, you know, protests and started to shoot, you know, police forces, police officers and security forces. And there were terrorist cells. They came in, they used Daesh-style terrorist operations. They got police officers, burned them alive, they beheaded them, and they started shooting at police officers and also to the people,"" Iranian foreign minister said.""So as a result, for three days, we had, in fact, fighting against terrorists, and not with the protesters. It was completely a different story,"" he added.During the interview, he also said that the Iranian government is not planning to hang the detained protestors, claiming that the situation is under government's control.""We are in full control,"" Araghchi said.""And let's, you know, hope that wisdom would prevail. And we don't go for a high level of tension, which could be disastrous for everybody,"" he added.Responding to a question from Fox News host Bret Baier on whether he had a message for President Trump, who is considering some kind of action to help the protesters on the ground, the Araghchi said ""My message is do not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,"" the Iranian Foreign Minister said.""You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result,"" he added.""You know in June, you destroyed the facilities, the machines, but the technology cannot be bombed. And the determination also cannot be bombed,"" Abbas Araghchi added.Araghchi said that the ""terrorists"" are shooting people just to drag US into the conflict.""They wanted to increase the number of deaths. Why? Because President Trump has said that if there are killings, he would intervene. And they wanted to drag him into this conflict,"" the Iranian foreign minister told Fox News.""And that was exactly an Israeli plot. They started to increase the number of deaths by killing ordinary people, by killing police officers, by starting a kind of, you know, fighting inside the different cities,"" he added.Amid the ongoing chain of events, Iran further extended its airspace to commercial aircraft. A notice to pilot said the closure was estimated to last until 7:30 am local time. A previous order had closed the airspace for just over two hours.However, the government offered no explanation of the decision to shut its airspace.Meanwhile, Air India and IndiGO also issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays as they said that their flights are using an alternative routing after the closure of Iran airspace.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays,” it said in a post on X.“Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remains top priority,” it added.Meanwhile, Air India cancelled Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning also returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea.Earlier on Wednesday, some US military personnel were advised to evacuate military base in Qatar as Trump warned of possible action after a deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.The decision came as a senior official in Tehran brought up the country's retaliatory attack in June at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar.An official, on the condition of anonymity, told news agency Associated Press that the move was precautionary and said such measures also were being taken across the region. The official, citing the need for operational security, would not go into further detail, including whether the evacuation was optional or mandatory, whether it affected troops or civilian personnel, or how many people were advised to leave.The US Embassy in Qatar issued a notice early Thursday saying it had “advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel” to Al Udeid Air Base. “We recommend US citizens in Qatar do the same,” it added. In Kuwait, the US embassy ordered a “temporary halt” to its personnel going to multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country amid heightened tensions. Kuwait is home to U.S. Army Central, the service’s Mideast command.Talking to news agency Reuters, Trump said that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi ""seems very nice"" but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.""He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,"" Trump said. ""And we really ‌aren't up to that point yet.Trump's comments went further in questioning Pahlavi's ability to lead Iran after saying last week that he had no plans to meet with him.Trump added that it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth ""any regime can fail.""""Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time,"" he said.The demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, as the country’s economy is squeezed by international sanctions levied in part over its nuclear program.Trump has repeatedly warned about potential US military action over the killing of peaceful protesters, just months after American forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war launched by Israel against the Islamic Republic in June.In other developments, a mass funeral was held on Wednesday for some 100 security force members killed in the demonstrations. Tens of thousands of mourners attended, holding Iranian flags and photos of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The caskets, draped in Iranian flags, stood stacked at least three high. Red and white roses and framed photographs of the dead covered them.People elsewhere remained fearful in the streets. Plainclothes security forces still milled around some neighborhoods, though anti-riot police and members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force appeared to have been sent back to their barracks.“We are very frightened because of these sounds (of gunfire) and protests,” said a mother of two shopping for fruits and vegetables, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “We have heard many are killed and many are injured. Now peace has been restored, but schools are closed, and I’m scared to send my children to school again.”Ahmadreza Tavakoli, 36, told The Associated Press he witnessed one demonstration in Tehran and was shocked by the use of firearms by authorities.“People were out to express themselves and protest, but quickly it turned into a war zone,” Tavakoli said. “The people do not have guns. Only the security forces have guns.”","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country.

Brussels Tightens Iran Sanctions As Eu Chief Von Der Leyen Vows Support For Protesters And Change

Iran linked to past plots and threats against Trump





Iranian state television aired footage on Sunday that included a threat directed at US President Donald Trump, following his recent warning of potential military action against Iran’s leadership.The footage showed a mourner at a ceremony for Iranian security personnel killed in recent unrest holding a placard with an image of Trump, referring to the assassination attempt he survived at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2024. Text in Farsi beneath the image read: ""This time it will not miss the target"".The incident represents Tehran’s most direct threat against Trump to date, coming after his repeated warnings that the United States would strike Iran if it continued its crackdown on anti-government protesters.Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot in the ear by a gunman identified as Thomas Crooks.The footage was aired on the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network (IRINN), a state-controlled television channel. It was broadcast during a funeral ceremony in Tehran for more than 100 members of the security forces and others described by authorities as “martyrs” killed during recent demonstrations.At the ceremony, attendees held banners reading “Death to America!” while others carried photographs of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is widely regarded as being close to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported that the funeral marked the first in a series of state ceremonies planned for security personnel in the coming days, as cited by The Independent.Rights groups outside Iran have said that more than 150 members of the security forces and government personnel have been killed during over two weeks of unrestIranian authorities have characterised the demonstrations as “riots” and accused protesters of carrying out “acts of terror”.Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes. Iranian officials have also repeatedly vowed to kill Trump following his order to assassinate General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, in January 2020.A video released in 2022 by Iranian state-linked media depicted a simulated assassination attempt on Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf course ahead of the 2024 election.The video resurfaced after the arrest of Ryan Routh, who was detained while allegedly attempting to take aim at Trump at the same golf course, as cited by the New York Post.The US Justice Department has also said that in 2024 it disrupted an Iranian-directed plot to kill Trump, following the arrest of Farhad Shakeri, who court documents say was tasked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps with carrying out the killing.The current protests broke out in Iran on December 28 after the collapse of the rial, amid economic pressure linked to international sanctions imposed in part over the country’s nuclear programme.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi gave a different account in an interview with Fox News, saying the protests began peacefully and that authorities initially engaged with demonstrators. He said the unrest later turned violent after what he described as “terrorist elements led from outside” Iran became involved.","Iran has previously been linked to assassination plots abroad, most often aimed at Iranian dissidents, with varying outcomes.

Trump Reveals New Venezuela Leader? Makes U-turn On Delcy, ‘Backs’ Machado After Maduro’s Capture





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for presenting him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal, an award she was conferred months ago.In a post after receiving the medal, Trump took to Truth Social, calling Machado a “wonderful woman.” “It was my great honor to meet María Corina Machado , of Venezuela, today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you, María!” he wrote.Machado said she presented Trump with her Nobel medal “as a recognition of his unique commitment to our freedom.” After the meeting, she told supporters that the interaction had gone well and that they could “count on” the US president.A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.However, days ago, the Nobel Committee and institute clarified on the permanence of a Nobel laureate's status. It announced that the prize can not be revoked, shared, or transferred to others.The meeting came just days after Trump launched strikes on Venezuela under Operation Absolute Resolve, which led to the toppling of President Nicolas Maduro and his capture along with his wife, who were taken into US custody thereafter.The US raid in Caracas on January 3 had briefly raised hopes among Venezuela’s embattled pro-democracy opposition, led by Machado, who had called for an “end to tyranny” in the country.However, Trump soon sidelined Machado after the US kidnapped Maduro, arguing that she lacked both domestic support and the respect needed to lead the country.Venezuela’s opposition maintains that Maduro rigged the 2024 election to deny victory to Machado’s party, allegations that have been backed by Washington.On Thursday, the White House said Trump’s view of Machado remains unchanged.","US President Donald Trump met with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodriguez on Thursday said her government was “not afraid” of a diplomatic confrontation with the United States, even and called on Washington to show “respect for the dignity” of her predecessor Nicolas Maduro, who was ousted in a US military strike.“We have asked of the government of the United States... respect for the dignity of president Nicolas Maduro and respect for the dignity and integrity of the first lady” Cilia Flores, who is also in custody, Rodriguez said in an address to parliament, as quoted by AFP.Maduro and Flores were taken by US forces to New York to face drug trafficking charges, after the vice president Rodriquez was recognised as interim leader provided her government stays with Washington, particularly on access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.Rodriguez also said her government was “not afraid” of a diplomatic confrontation with the United States. “We know they are very powerful, we know they are a lethal nuclear power... We are not afraid to confront them diplomatically, through political dialogue,” she said. Rodriguez, a Maduro ally, is considered someone US President Donald Trump is willing to work with, provided she aligns with Washington’s directives.Rodriguez had spoken by telephone on Wednesday with US President Donald Trump, who described her as “a terrific person.”Trump said on social media that he and Rodriguez had discussed “many topics,” including oil, minerals, trade and national security. “We are making tremendous progress,” he added.In a separate development with regards to oil, Rodriguez, during her parliament address, announced plans to reform the country’s oil legislation as she seeks to recalibrate relations with Washington.Without offering specifics, Rodriguez told parliament that the reforms would address Venezuela’s anti-blockade law, which gives the government tools to counteract US sanctions imposed since 2019.Since Maduro’s capture, President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States now controls Venezuela and its oil sector, demanding what he describes as unfettered access.Rodriguez has been navigating a diplomatic tightrope, trying to meet Trump’s demands without alienating Maduro loyalists who control Venezuela’s security forces and feared paramilitaries.She described her call with the US leader as “productive and courteous” and characterised by “mutual respect.”On Thursday, Rodriguez said that if she must ever visit Washington as interim president, “I will go standing, walking, not dragged.""While Trump has so far cold‑shouldered Venezuela’s opposition, which is widely considered to have won the July 2024 presidential elections, on Thursday he met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for what the White House called “positive” talks.","Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodriguez said her government was “not afraid’ of a diplomatic confrontation with the United States.

Former US senator Kyrsten Sinema, who left politics and has now become a lobbyist, has been sued by a North Carolina woman, Heather Ammel, who claimed that Sinema, the bisexual former Democrat leader, stole her husband, leading to their divorce. The lawsuit claims Sinema wooed her head of security Matthew Ammel by purchasing him a personal massager, drinking Dom Perignon with him in Cindy McCain’s suite at a U2 concert, suggesting he score MDMA so she could “guide him through a psychedelic experience,” and taking him to a Taylor Swift concert.In her complaint, Heather said her husband is an Army veteran who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after deployments to the Middle East. They married in 2010, and she was a stay-at-home mom. In 2022, he got a job as part of Sinema’s security detail.In 2023, Ammel became the chief and the then chief told him on way out that Sinema was havinhg sexual relations with other security members.Matthew Ammel began accompanying Sinema on work trips in 2023, according to the complaint. They went to Napa Valley, then to a U2 concert at The Sphere in Las Vegas. They began chatting frequently on the encrypted messaging app Signal.Sinema sent him pictures of herself wrapped in a towel, the lawsuit says. The senator volunteered to help him work through his mental health issues and suggested he pick up MDMA to aid in a “psychedelic experience. ”The lawsuit mentions that Ammel attended Swift's concert with Sinema in Miami, the concert for which he previously arranged tickets for his wife and their three children. After returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia with Sinema in November 2024, Matthew Ammel separated from his wife, the complaint said, adding that they are still in a relationship, though Sinema left politics.","Kyrsten Sinema has been sued by a North Carolina woman, Heather Ammel, who claimed that SinemA stole her husband, leading to their divorce.

Russia's ULTIMATUM To NATO As Troops Land In Greenland; 'If You Don't Stop, You Will Face Severe...'





The White House on Thursday reiterated that President Donald Trump wants to 'acquire Greenland' and that the deployment of European troop will not affect his plans to take control of the Arctic island from Denmark.""The President has made his priority quite clear. He wants the United States to acquire Greenland. He thinks it is in our best national security to do that,"" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a media briefing.Also talking about Europe deploying troops to Greenland she said, “I don't think troops in Europe impact the president's decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all.""Her comments came as European Nato countries began deploying military personnel to the strategic Arctic territory, prompting a sharp response from Russia. The move follows a high-level meeting in Washington between US, Danish and Greenlandic officials that failed to bridge what Denmark described as a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory Trump has repeatedly said the US needs to seize for security reasons.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that a “working group” would be established to discuss strengthening Arctic security, but stressed that the initiative would not resolve the underlying dispute. “The American ambition to take over Greenland remains intact,” Frederiksen said, calling the situation “a serious matter” and adding that Denmark would continue efforts to prevent such a scenario, according to AFP.The remarks came as France, Germany, Sweden and Norway announced the deployment of military personnel to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, as part of a reconnaissance mission. Greenland’s deputy prime minister, Mute Egede, said Nato forces would have a greater presence on the island in the coming days, with increased military flights and naval activity, adding that the troops would be “training”, AFP reported.Germany’s defence ministry said the mission was intended to examine ways to ensure Arctic security in response to “Russian and Chinese threats”. French President Emmanuel Macron said the first French military personnel were already en route.Russia reacted strongly to the deployments, with its embassy in Belgium saying the expanding NATO presence in Greenland was “of serious concern” and accusing the alliance of building up forces under a “false pretext” of threats from Moscow and Beijing.Trump has argued that if the United States does not take control of Greenland, “China or Russia will”, remarks that have heightened tensions within Nato and raised concerns among Greenland’s residents about becoming caught in a broader geopolitical confrontation.","White House says deployment of European troops will not affect plans to 'acquire' Greenland from Denmark.

The United States claimed Iran halted 800 planned executions following pressure from President Donald Trump over Tehran’s crackdown on nationwide protests, even as Washington warned that military action remains an option.“The president understands today that 800 executions that were scheduled and supposed to take place yesterday were halted,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.“All options remain on the table for the president,” she said, adding that Trump had warned Iran of “grave consequences” if the killing of demonstrators continued.The White House also said that ""President Donald Trump is closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Iran,"" as quoted by Reuters.Earlier, Trump had said said that intermediaries from Iran had conveyed guarantees that executions would be halted. According to Trump, the assurances came from “very important sources on the other side,” even as regional allies grew increasingly concerned that rising tensions could trigger direct confrontation.With rhetoric from Washington and Tehran temporarily softening, a senior Saudi official told AFP on Thursday that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman spearheaded an urgent diplomatic push to restrain Trump, citing fears of “grave blowbacks in the region”.The official said the three Gulf states mounted what he described as “a long, frantic, diplomatic last-minute effort to convince President Trump to give Iran a chance to show good intention”, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions.A second Gulf official corroborated the account, saying the diplomatic outreach also included a warning to Tehran that any strike on US facilities in the region would “have consequences”.The developments come as Iranian authorities continue a nationwide internet shutdown that activists fear is intended to conceal the scale of the crackdown. The blackout has now entered its seventh day. “Exactly one week ago... Iran fell into digital darkness as authorities imposed a national internet blackout,” internet monitoring group Netblocks said in a social media post, as quoted by AFP.Meanwhile, the US announced a new round of sanctions targeting Iranian officials accused of repressing protests challenging Iran’s theocratic leadership. Among those sanctioned is the secretary of Iran’s Supreme Council for National Security, whom the US Treasury Department accuses of being among the first officials to call for violence against protesters.The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also designated 18 individuals and companies alleged to be involved in laundering money from Iranian oil sales through a shadow banking network linked to sanctioned institutions Bank Melli and Shahr Bank. Shadow banking refers to financial activities that resemble traditional banking but operate outside standard regulatory frameworks.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the United States “stands firmly behind the Iranian people in their call for freedom and justice” and that Treasury “will use every tool to target those behind the regime's tyrannical oppression of human rights.”The protests erupted on December 28 following the collapse of Iran’s rial currency, as the country’s economy has come under pressure from international sanctions imposed in part over its nuclear programme.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered a different account during an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Special Report with Bret Baier” on Wednesday, saying the protests began peacefully “and the government engaged with the protesters and with their leaders.” He said that after the tenth day, however, “terrorist elements led from outside” the country appeared and the demonstrations turned violent.In February, Trump reimposed a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran aimed at blocking its development of nuclear weapons, including US-led strikes on three major Iranian enrichment facilities.While the threat of US retaliation over the deaths of protesters continues to loom, Trump has signalled the possibility of de-escalation, saying the killing appeared to be ending.The sanctions bar the targeted individuals and entities from accessing property or financial assets held in the US and prohibit US citizens and companies from doing business with them, though US officials acknowledge the measures are largely symbolic, as many of those sanctioned do not hold assets in US institutions.","The United States claims Iran halted 800 planned executions following pressure from President Donald Trump.

SENATE DRAMA: Vance Saves Trump as War Powers Vote Collapses | Venezuela | Iran





US President Donald Trump on Thursday met Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House, where she presented him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal.The meeting was confirmed by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who described Machado as “a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela,” and said Trump had anticipated a “good and positive discussion. ”However, Leavitt played down expectations that the meeting marked a shift in Trump’s stance toward Machado’s political future. Asked whether the president still believed she lacked sufficient support to lead Venezuela, Leavitt said his view remained unchanged. “I think the president’s assessment that you just pointed out was based on realities on the ground. It was a realistic assessment based on what the president was reading and hearing from his advisors and national security team, and at this moment in time,” she said.Leavitt added that Trump remains “committed to hopefully seeing elections in Venezuela one day,” but declined to specify any timeline.Machado later told reporters that she had presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it “a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom.” The White House did not immediately confirm whether Trump accepted the medal.Later, Trump also confirmed the gesture calling Machado a ""wonderful woman"".It was my Great Honor to meet María Corina Machado, of Venezuela, today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!"" he said on Truth Social.The meeting followed a closed-door discussion at the White House, after which Machado briefly greeted supporters gathered outside. “We can count on President Trump,” she told them, prompting chants of “Thank you, Trump"".The meeting comes less than two weeks after US forces captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas and transported them to New York to face drug trafficking charges. Machado’s political coalition is widely believed to have won Venezuela’s disputed 2024 presidential election, results that were rejected by Maduro before his arrest.Despite Thursday’s meeting, Trump has previously questioned Machado’s credibility and ability to govern. He has also signalled a willingness to work with acting President Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s former vice president, who continues to oversee day-to-day government operations alongside other members of the ousted leader’s inner circle.Leavitt saidthat Machado sought the meeting without preconditions. “I don’t think he needs to hear anything from Ms. Machado,” she said, beyond a “frank and positive discussion about what’s taking place in Venezuela.”Machado spent roughly two and a half hours at the White House and later visited Capitol Hill for meetings with senators. She did not answer questions from reporters about the Nobel medal as she departed, responding only with “gracias.”The White House meeting took place as Washington intensifies pressure on Venezuela’s oil sector, including the recent seizure of a sanctioned tanker linked to Caracas. US officials say interim authorities under Rodríguez have been cooperating with Washington, including releasing detainees held under Maduro. Five Americans were freed earlier this week. However, the acting president, in her address to parliament, said that she ""was not afraid"" of ""diplomatic clashes"" with the US. She further said that she told the US government to show ""respect for the dignity"" of ousted leader Maduro.Trump said on Wednesday that he had a “great conversation” with Rodríguez, his first since Maduro’s ouster. “We had a call, a long call. We discussed a lot of things,” Trump said. “And I think we’re getting along very well with Venezuela.”Even so, Trump has continued to express scepticism about Machado’s leadership prospects. Shortly after Maduro’s capture, he said it would be “very tough for her to be the leader,” arguing she lacked sufficient support within the country.Machado, who has spent much of the past year in hiding after briefly being detained in Caracas, has sought to avoid openly confronting Trump, while quietly building ties with US conservatives and senior officials. Her appearance in Washington marks one of her highest-profile public outings since winning the Nobel Peace Prize last year.","US President Donald Trump met Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House.

Partial ban:

Immigration attorney Steven Brown said it is unlikely that India could ever face a visa freeze in the US as India is low on using government resources in the US. But that does not mean it can't change ever, the attorney said explaining the Trump administration's sudden visa freeze on 75 countries, including many of those which were already facing travel ban.Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan are on the list of the 75 countries. Afghanistan has been facing travel ban as well but the rest are new inclusions. That makes India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives from South Asia excluded from the list.The president has a broad discretion over 212(f) to deny entry to any group of nationals, Brown said, adding that the first Trump administration saw a Muslim ban. There can be no certainty on what's next but this freeze is predicated on countries that use government resources, the attorney said.The US State Department said the visa pause for 75 countries will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people. The decision comes in the wake of a major welfare scam allegedly being uncovered in Minnesota by the Somali immigrants.In December 2025, the administration published a list of 39 countries from which nationals are either fully or partially banned from traveling to the US.Most of those countries are also featured on the new list of 76 countries. But the immigrant visa ban is not meant for tourists, students, or people coming to the US for employment. The immigrant visa freeze means people seeking permanent residency or Green Cards in the US will be affected.Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Myanmar (Burma), Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Palestinian Authority travel document holders under the full travel ban.Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Myanmar, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Yemen.","Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan are on the list of the 75 countries.

The White House debunked the reports claiming that US President Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public.In a post on X, the Trump administration, sharing the Daily Beast report on the president's health, said, ""Another day, another BS Fake News ""story"" from the Daily Beast. President Trump is in excellent health, despite all of your deranged wishcasting. ""The Daily Beast reported that Professor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine claimed that Trump suffered a stroke, and cited what he called “lines of evidence supportive” during an appearance on the podcast The Court of History.Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz: “I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” and added, “I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025.”He said he based his claim on videos and public footage. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”Davidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said was common among stroke patients.He said Trump now routinely appeared to nod off during public appearances such as White House events.He further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the President being right-handed, was “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”Davidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believed the President may have suffered, but said if he was correct then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”Speculation about Trump’s mental and physical decline circulated for months. The President frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he attempted to conceal with blotches of makeup.",Daily Beast reported that Professor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine claimed that US President Donald Trump suffered a stroke. Davidson cited what he called “lines of evidence supportive” during an appearance on the podcast The Court of History.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126551624,imgsize-44420,width-400,resizemode-4/us-president-donald-trump.jpg"
