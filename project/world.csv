US President Donald Trump has once again claimed credit for averting a potential war between India and Pakistan, saying he used the threat of steep trade tariffs to stop the two nuclear-armed neighbours from ""going at it. ""Speaking to Fox News on Sunday (local time), Trump said his administration leveraged economic pressure to defuse tensions following India’s Operation Sindoor in May, when forces carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.""They were going at it — seven planes were shot down. That's a lot. And they were going at it. That could have been a nuclear war,"" Trump said, adding that his trade threats ""settled the war.""The Republican leader claimed that by warning both New Delhi and Islamabad of 200 per cent tariffs, he pushed them to step back from the brink.""I said to India and Pakistan pretty much the same thing: 'Look, if you're going to fight each other, I'm not going to do business with you. We're going to put on a 200 per cent tariff.It'll make it impossible for you to do business',"" Trump asserted.This isn't the first time Trump has boasted of ""ending"" conflicts through tariffs. During the interview, he said he had ""ended eight wars,"" five of them ""because of tariffs.""However, India has consistently refuted Trump's repeated claims of mediation, insisting that the country's military and diplomatic measures were independent of any foreign intervention.","US President Donald Trump has claimed credit for averting a potential war between India and Pakistan.

MNS, Sena UBT Hit Back

MUMBAI: Closing ranks ahead of the civic elections, the opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1 against “arbitrary and corrupt administration of Election Commission”.The announcement was made Sunday, just after Raj accused EC of inserting 96 lakh fake voters in the electoral lists across Maharashtra for the benefit of those in office. “An attempt is being made to finish off regional parties... 8-10 lakh fake voters have been added in Mumbai and 8-8.5 lakh in Thane, Pune and Nashik each,” Raj said at a party meeting.This will be the first time Congress and MNS cadres will be marching together amid rumblings in the national party’s city unit over an alliance, even though the two parties have been part of the opposition’s meeting with EC on electoral lists. Left parties have also signalled their support for the initiative aimed at bringing the opposition together and keeping the ‘vote chori’ narrative alive ahead of the local body polls.“We will soon announce the time and route of the march in Mumbai... We are going to show the entire country how Maharashtra is fighting to protect democracy,” said Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut at a joint press conference at Shiv Sena (UBT) Bhavan.The meet was attended by NCP (SP) MLA Jayant Patil, Congress functionary Sachin Sawant, MNS functionaries Bala Nandgaonkar and Abhijit Panse, and CPI functionary Prakash Reddy.Raut said people from every district who had lost their right to vote would join the march. “We will show the strength of the voters to the PM, the Union home minister and EC. It is necessary to give a jolt to EC. We also want to tell EC and the rulers in Delhi that Maharashtra is not sitting idle while so much injustice is happening,” Raut said.Raj also asked EC how it would hold local body polls without cleaning up the electoral list. Addressing MNS booth-level agents, he urged them to verify the lists to weed out fake voters. “If polls have to be held peacefully, then clean the electoral list first,” he warned. Without naming BJP, he said the party in office wanted to contest elections by adding fake names to the voters’ list. “It does not matter whether you cast a vote or not. The match has been fixed. What kind of democracy is this?” Raj said.","The opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1.

Poll Do you believe the Public Safety Act should be repealed in Jammu and Kashmir? Yes, it should be repealed. No, it is necessary for security.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday launched a sharp attack against Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah over his demand to remove the controversial Public Safety Act in the Union territory.Owaisi reminded Abdullah that the law has been ""misused"" by every elected and unelected government, which has led to ""untold suffering and human rights violations "".Taking a poetic jibe on J&K CM, Owaisi said, ""The Public Safety Act, 1978 (PSA) was introduced by Sheikh Abdullah in 1978 to deal with smuggling. Farooq Abdullah, G M Shah, Mufti Sayeed, GN Azad, Omar Abdullah & Mehbooba Mufti have all been CMs of J&K. They could have easily repealed PSA & prevented untold suffering and human rights violations.""""The law has been misused by virtually every elected CM & unelected Governors. Over 20,000 people have been jailed since 1978 without criminal charges, fair trials or even a proper appeals process. Some detentions were extended for up to 7-12 years. One separatist was detained under the PSA and, when he was later needed, he was served with a court warrant and granted bail. Now there is a truncated elected govt, and it has dawned on it to do away with the PSA,"" he added.""Sab kuch luta ke hosh mein aaye to kya kiya, Din mein agar chiragh jalaye to kya kiya,"" Owaisi further said.This comes after Omar Abdullah said that an elected government must have control over state subjects, including law and order and security, for it to remove the PSA.""We said in the manifesto that we would remove the Public Safety and Security Act (PSA) from Jammu and Kashmir. To remove it, we must have statehood.

Originally enacted in 1978 to curb timber smuggling, the law was later invoked to detain political leaders and individuals deemed a threat to public order—particularly during the militancy surge in Kashmir in the early 1990s.One of the most recent detentions under the PSA is that of Aam Aadmi Party MLA Mehraj Malik, who has been lodged in Kathua district jail since September 8, 2025, for allegedly disturbing public order in Doda district and using abusive language against the district’s deputy commissioner.","Owaisi reminded Abdullah that the law has been ""misused"" by every elected and unelected government, which has led to ""untold suffering and human rights violations"" This comes after Omar Abdullah said that an elected government must have control over state subjects, including law and order and security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124683479,imgsize-1024508,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

‘Why Spend Money On Diyas’: Akhilesh Yadav’s Remark On Ayodhya Deepotsav Sparks Row, BJP Hits Out

'They erased Ayodhya’s identity'



'A festival of truth and faith'



From 1.71 lakh diyas to millions



NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday launched a fierce attack on the Congress and Samajwadi Party, accusing them of “insulting India’s eternal faith” and obstructing the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Speaking at the ninth edition of Deepotsav-2025 in Shri Ayodhya Dham, the chief minister framed the festival as both a spiritual celebration and a symbolic triumph of truth over falsehood.Addressing thousands gathered amid the glow of millions of diyas, CM Yogi alleged that both Congress and SP had worked to “erase Ayodhya’s identity” and hinder the construction of the Ram Temple.“While we are illuminating Ayodhya with millions of lamps, we must not forget that during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the Congress party declared in court that Lord Shri Ram was a myth. The Congress party gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that Shri Ram was a myth, and the Samajwadi Party had fired bullets at Ram devotees in this very Ayodhya,” he said.He accused the opposition of double standards, saying, “These are the same people who pray at Babar’s tomb but rejected the invitation to the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla in the temple at Ayodhya.”Continuing his criticism, CM Yogi said the opposition parties had for decades attempted to undermine the spiritual heritage of Ayodhya.“We must remember their double standards. These are the same people who, during the Ram Mandir movement, deployed separate advocates to prevent the construction of the temple in Ayodhya, so they could protest and create obstacles in the path of the Ram Mandir. But today we can say they fired bullets; we are lighting lamps in Ayodhya,” he said.He further claimed that the previous governments had “erased Ayodhya’s identity” by renaming it Faizabad. “We have restored the name and legacy of Ayodhya, making it Ayodhya Dham again,” he added.Reflecting on the origins of Deepotsav, CM Yogi recalled the humble beginnings of the celebration when his government revived the tradition in 2017.“When we decided in 2017 to organise the first Deepotsav in Ayodhya Dham, the sentiment behind it was singular: to show the world how lamp-lighting should be done and on what occasion it should be celebrated,” he said.He added that the festival symbolised a return to India’s ancient roots: “Thousands of years ago, when the world was living in darkness, Ayodhya had lit lamps to welcome its Lord, its deity, and the arrival of its faith--those very lamps became the great festival of Sanatana Dharma in the form of Deepotsav and Deepawali.”The chief minister also recalled the logistical challenges faced during the inaugural Deepotsav.“When we decided to carry forward that campaign again to keep the spirit of Deepotsav alive, in 2017 we did not have sufficient lamps. We collected lamps from across the state and managed to light 1.71 lakh diyas. Today, millions of lamps are lit in Ayodhya Dham,” he said, calling it a symbol of “the awakening of faith and pride in Indian culture.”",Yogi Adityanath launches fierce attack on Congress and Samajwadi Party.

No undue leniency or excessive severity in sentencing: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-undue-leniency-or-excessive-severity-in-sentencing-sc/articleshow/124695123.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has cautioned trial courts and HCs against undue leniency or excessive severity while imposing punishment on a person convicted of an offence and said that deviation from this time-tested sentencing policy could erode public faith in the judiciary or lead to injustice.“Undue leniency can cause public confidence in the justice system to plummet, while excessive severity may lead to injustice,” ruled a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih while rejecting a plea for reduction of the eight-year sentence imposed on a youth who, in the heat of the moment during an altercation, struck a blow that led to the death of a man.The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister. His sister had given birth to a child on account of the sexual assault. The family of the man who raped the girl was unwilling to accede to the proposal to get the rape survivor married to him. The man was in jail on the charge of sexual assault. When the accused, with his family, was visiting the alleged rapist’s family to resolve the issue of his sister’s proposed marriage to him, an altercation broke out, in course of which the alleged rapist’s brother intervened in an effort to calm the situation.But the accused was so enraged by the sexual assault on his sister, coupled with the alleged rapist’s refusal to marry her, that he picked up an axe and gave a fatal blow to the one attempting to pacify the two sides.Senior advocate Rahul Kaushik told the court that the accused was merely 20 years old when the incident happened.Highlighting that the crime was not pre-meditated, he pleaded for leniency in sentence, which had been reduced to eight years by the HC from 10 years imposed by the trial court.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta agreed that the appellant may have been deprived of self-control because of his sister’s alleged rape at the hands of the man. But he found no sudden provocation in the circumstances to warrant the trial court's converting a murder case into a culpable homicide one.","The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister.

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: Union home ministry has invited representatives of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) for talks in New Delhi on Oct 22, weeks after both Ladakhi groups withdrew from dialogue following the Sept 24 police firing that left four dead and over 70 wounded during violent protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the Union territory.Ladakhi functionaries welcomed the outreach and confirmed joint participation. “Both LAB and KDA will participate, along with the MP for Ladakh and our lawyer,” LAB co-chairman Chering Dorjay said Sunday in Leh. Chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will also attend.The talks are set to discuss constitutional safeguards on land, culture, and environment, according to sources.Dorjay said the groups told the ministry that their key demands — statehood and Sixth Schedule status — remain unmet. “We said there will be talks on these two issues, and we are hopeful that govt will engage sincerely this time with an open mind and in a good atmosphere,” he said. “We expect the discussions will be fruitful… we are hopeful of good results.”KDA’s Sajjad Kargili said: “We are meeting for statehood and Sixth Schedule, justice for the Sept 24 victims, and release of those arrested, including Sonam Wangchuk.We believe only genuine dialogue can restore trust and fulfil Ladakh’s aspirations.”Thupstan Chhewang, a former MP and one of Ladakh’s senior-most Buddhist figures, will lead the LAB delegation. Dorjay will accompany him, while KDA will be represented by Asgar Ali Karbali, Qamar Ali Akhoon, and Kargili.The talks trace back to the creation of Ladakh as a separate UT after the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019. Following sustained protests under LAB and KDA banners, the home ministry formed a high-powered committee on Jan 2, 2023, to address Ladakh’s political and constitutional demands.The last meeting between the committee and Ladakhi representatives took place on May 27, leading to the rollout of a domicile policy. Frustration grew as talks stalled, prompting climate activist Wangchuk — a vocal advocate for Sixth Schedule protection — to begin a 35-day hunger strike on Sept 9, accusing Centre of delaying dialogue on restoring Ladakh’s democratic rights.The home ministry had announced a new round of talks for Oct 6, but violence erupted on Sept 24 when police and paramilitary forces opened fire on protesters in Leh — prompting Wangchuk to break his fast. Authorities later imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended internet, and arrested over 70 people, including Wangchuk, who was charged under National Security Act and moved to Jodhpur jail.LAB and KDA withdrew from talks soon after, demanding a judicial probe led by a retired Supreme Court judge and the release of all those arrested. On Oct 17, the home ministry announced a judicial inquiry into the firing and reaffirmed its readiness for dialogue, prompting both groups to return to the table.",Home ministry invites representatives of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) for talks in New Delhi on Oct 22.

Opposition disarray, PM Modi to launch BJP campaign



NEW DELHI: The political battle for Bihar intensified on Sunday with a flurry of developments — from the AIMIM releasing its first list of 25 candidates to Giriraj Singh stirring controversy with his remarks on Muslims. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) faced embarrassment over a last-minute candidate swap, while Chirag Paswan redefined his “MY” formula ahead of the polls. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to kick off the BJP’s campaign on October 24.The Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM announced its first list of 25 candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, including two non-Muslims. The list features state party chief Akhtarul Iman, its lone MLA, who will again contest from Amour.The party posted on X: “We are happy to announce the list of AIMIM candidates for the upcoming Bihar elections... Inshallah, we will be a voice of justice for Bihar’s weakest and most neglected.”Most of AIMIM’s seats are concentrated in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region. The party has also fielded Manoj Kumar Das from Sikandra in Gaya and Rana Ranjeet Singh from Dhaka in East Champaran.In 2020, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four MLAs later joined the RJD. Its overtures to the INDIA bloc this year were ignored, prompting the party to go solo in 2025.Union minister Giriraj Singh triggered outrage by saying he does not need the votes of “namak haraams” (betrayers) while addressing a rally in Arwal district.“Muslims take the benefits of all central schemes but don’t vote for us... Such people are called ‘namak haraam’,” the BJP MP from Begusarai said.He added, “I asked a maulvi whether he had an Ayushman Bharat card and whether Modi abused him. He said no. Then I asked, what was my fault? Someone who doesn’t acknowledge kindness is a ‘namak haraam’.”JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Singh was “free to use words as per his choice” but admitted it was “a matter of concern” that some communities benefited from schemes yet did not vote for the BJP.RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary slammed Singh, saying, “BJP leaders can’t say anything except Hindu-Muslim... They divert attention from issues like unemployment and education.”Independent MP Pappu Yadav also attacked the minister, saying, “Giriraj babu must tell us who supported the British during India’s freedom struggle... Those who supported the enemy should be called ‘namak haraam’.”The JD(U) found itself in an awkward position after withdrawing Sabir Ali’s candidature from Amour just a day after announcing it. The party reinstated Saba Zafar, who had already filed his nomination on the JD(U) ticket.Zafar told reporters, “There should be no confusion. I filed my nomination papers yesterday. I was never asked to return my poll symbol.”Ali, who had been expelled from the JD(U) in 2014, said, “Admittedly, the news of my candidature had been disseminated from official channels... But I am ready to campaign for JD(U) wherever I am told, even on the Siachen glacier.”The confusion comes as both the NDA and INDIA bloc face internal turmoil over seat sharing and candidate selection ahead of the November 6 and 11 polls.Former RJD candidate Madan Shah broke down outside the residence of RJD chief and former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday, alleging betrayal over the Bihar Assembly Elections 2025 ticket.Speaking to the media, Shah claimed, “Lalu Prasad Yadav promised to give me a ticket for the Bihar Assembly Elections 2025. RJD leader Sanjay Yadav had demanded Rs 2.7 crore, and when I refused to pay, the party ticket was given to someone else.”Overcome with emotion, he tore his clothes, fell to the ground, and said, “They will not form the government; Tejashwi is very arrogant, doesn’t meet people. They are giving away tickets. Sanjay Yadav is doing all this. I have come here to die. Lalu Yadav is my Guru.”Shah added that in 2020, Lalu Prasad had promised him a ticket after a community survey.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan unveiled a new meaning for his “MY” formula, saying it stands for “Mahilayein and Youth,” under his “Bihar First, Bihari First” vision.“When I talk about ‘MY,’ ‘M’ stands for ‘mahilayein’ (women) and ‘Y’ for youth. Both face similar issues,” Paswan told ANI. “Unlike others who divide youth on caste lines, my focus is on empowerment and development.”Speaking in Patna, Paswan told ANI, “Every party wants its leader to become the chief minister. I myself wanted my father to become the chief minister or even the Prime Minister. Discussions on these topics should be held at the right occasions.”He said his party is contesting 29 seats — the same number his father Ram Vilas Paswan had won in 2005 — calling it a “spiritual connection.” One of the party’s candidates, Seema Singh, had her nomination rejected on technical grounds, and Paswan said the party had approached the Election Commission to reconsider.“If the Mahagathbandhan cannot resolve its internal confusion, how will it work for Bihar’s development? The public has faith in the NDA,” he said, expressing confidence of achieving a “100 per cent strike rate.”The INDIA bloc continued to struggle with seat-sharing talks as the JMM decided to contest six seats independently. The Congress, meanwhile, released five new names, replacing some sitting MLAs amid internal protests over ticket distribution.Senior Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “We are close to reaching an agreement... Things should become clearer by the time withdrawal of nomination papers takes place.”With confusion persisting in both camps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch the BJP’s campaign on October 24, signalling the start of the high-octane phase of Bihar’s two-phase election. Polling will take place on November 6 and 11, and results will be announced on November 14.",The AIMIM releases its first list of 25 candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections.

I myself wanted my father to become the chief minister or even the Prime Minister. Discussions on these topics should be held at the right occasions.”Paswan reaffirmed his support for the current NDA leadership in Bihar, adding that “many leaders of the NDA alliance have made it clear that we are contesting the elections under the leadership of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, and after the elections, the elected MLAs will once again choose Nitish Kumar as the chief minister.” He said his focus remains on Bihar’s development, noting, “I wanted to contest the Bihar elections , but the prolonged negotiations shifted my priority to focusing on the candidates of my party. In the next four to five years, I will try to focus on Bihar even more.”Ahead of the polls, Paswan has also redefined the “MY” equation — traditionally associated with the RJD’s Muslim-Yadav base — to represent Mahilayein (women) and Yuva (youth). Explaining his “Bihar First, Bihari First” vision, he told ANI, “When I talk about 'MY equation', 'M' stands for 'mahilayein' and 'Y' stands for youth. I believe both face similar issues.I am moving forward with the idea of 'Bihar First - Bihari First', where we can progress toward building a 'Viksit Bihar'. ”Paswan said his party’s contest on 29 seats — the same number his father won in the 2005 assembly elections — was a “spiritual signal.” “I believe in manifestations and stay spiritually connected. It cannot be a mere coincidence that after all the negotiations, my party is contesting elections on 29 seats, and my father also won elections on 29 seats,” he said.The LJP (RV) chief added that his party is exploring legal options after one candidate’s nomination was rejected due to “human error”. He expressed confidence in the NDA’s prospects, saying the opposition’s internal discord would only strengthen his alliance. “If the Mahagathbandhan is not able to resolve confusion within the alliance, how will they work for the development of the people of Bihar?” he asked.Paswan said he believes the NDA could perform even better than expected, adding, “Until now, we were measuring ourselves based on our hard work. Now, in the way the opposition has become complacent, the advantage of that will also go to us.”Polling in the Bihar Assembly elections is scheduled for November 6 and 11, with results to be declared on November 14.",Paswan reaffirmed his support for the current NDA leadership in Bihar.

Rahul Gandhi Slams PM Modi After Trump Claims India Assured Him to Cut Russian Oil Imports

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being ""frightened"" of Donald Trump , hours after the US President claimed that the PM has ""assured him that India would stop buying Russian oil"".The Congress leader said the Prime Minister ""keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs"".""PM Modi is frightened of Trump. 1.

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India.

""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia.

India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

On Cam: First Visuals Of Priceless Napoleon Jewels Robbed In Brazen Daylight Louvre Heist I Paris

What’s happening now?





Within a matter of four to seven minutes , thieves stole eight pieces of jewelry, which officials described as ‘incalculable’ value, from the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday. The daylight heist, which was orchestrated about 30 minutes after the opening, is among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory.Taking advantage of ongoing renovations, the thieves, disguised in workers' vests, broke into the museum before escaping swiftly on scooters on Sunday morning between 09:30 and 09:40 local time, stealing France’s historic collection of crown jewels.They stole eight items in total, which, according to the officials, include: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a reliquary brooch; Empress Eugénie’s diadem; and her large corsage-bow brooch.The thieves also tried to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife to Napoleon III, however, they abandoned it after the guards confronted them. This heavily adorned crown with 1,354 diamonds, 1,136 rose-cut diamonds, and 56 emeralds was later found outside the museum, French authorities said. It was reportedly recovered and broken.The French authorities have described the stolen pieces as ‘priceless’ and ‘of immeasurable heritage value’.Culture Minister Rachida Dati told French news outlet TF1 that the robbery was 'very professional'. Here’s a detailed view of the jewelry stolen from the Louvre museum.Among the prized possessions stolen from the Louvre museum was an exquisite diadem that belonged to Empress Eugénie. This piece features 212 pearls, 1,998 diamonds, and 992 rose-cut diamonds.Another treasured jewelry is the bow adorned with 2,438 diamonds and 196 rose-cut diamonds. The bow features bejeweled tassels and is the centerpiece of a belt; however, the museum website says there is no imagery of the finished item.A prized 19th-century imperial ensemble stolen from Louvre museum is the diamond brooch of the Empress. Called a reliquary brooch, this piece is adorned with diamonds; however, despite its name, it does not contain a relic.The thieves also stole pieces from the Sapphire set, linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. The stolen pieces were a tiara embellished with 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds. The necklace stolen from the set has 8 sapphires, numerous diamonds, in an intricate gold setting. The thieves also stole one of the earrings. The stolen set is originally part of a larger set with brooches, a comb, and bracelets. This set is described by the website Louvre as a ‘precious testimony to Parisian jewelry.’Among the most exquisite pieces stolen are parts of Napoleonʼs emerald wedding gift set, which was added to the Louvre’s collection in 2004. This was given by Napoleon to his second wife, Marie Louise, during their marriage in 1810. The necklace has 32 emeralds and 1,138 diamonds. The set also includes emerald and diamond earrings, which were stolen.The forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, the authorities said. So, will they be able to recover the stolen jewels? The recovery could be difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again. Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance,” Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds, told AP.Meanwhile, the authorities are still looking for answers about how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance. The authorities are looking at CCTV footage, inspecting the basket lift the thieves used to get to the gallery, and the staff, who were on the site, are being interviewed.","Thieves stole eight pieces of jewelry, which officials described as ‘incalculable’ value, from the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday.

Trump mocks movement





Large crowds of protesters gathered across all 50 states of the US on Saturday against President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched into its third week amid a legislative deadlock.While the protesters called the demonstration the “No Kings” movement, Republicans ridiculed it as “Hate America” rallies.Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states including Washington, Los Angeles, Montana, and several other places.More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states — from major cities such as Washington D.C. and New York to small towns across the Midwest.In San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she had never attended a protest before. Only recently, she began to view Trump as a “dictator.”“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands in Washington near the US Capitol, where the federal government remained shut for a third week amid a legislative deadlock.Demonstrators slammed what they called the Republican billionaire’s strong-arm tactics, including attacks on the media, political opponents, and undocumented immigrants.It was the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only closed federal programs and services but also tested the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces and National Guard troops into US cities — viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities — sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies leading to deportations and alleged injustices, and the government shutdown’s impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Meanwhile, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before departing for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.Trump’s campaign social media account also mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president dressed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.Republican leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”","More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states.

FULL: Trump’s Shocking U-turn On Tomahawks After Putin’s Call | Watch Big Russia Announcement





US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting came amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.“It’s an honour to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,” Trump said as he welcomed Zelenskyy. “We’ve gotten along really very well.” He added that his recent call with Putin had been “productive” and that he believed “something can get done” to bring peace between the two countries.Trump said both leaders Putin and Zelenskyy “don’t like each other,” calling the hostility “tremendous bad blood.” “These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everyone,” he said. “So one way or another, we’ll be involved in talks, but it might need to be in separate settings.”Asked about military aid, Trump expressed hesitation over supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is that it’s not easy for us to give massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said.“Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”He added, “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’re in it to get the war over. We’re not in it to sell weapons.” Trump’s comments came after Putin reportedly warned that supplying long-range missiles could escalate the conflict and make peace talks harder.The meeting, their third in the Oval Office and sixth this year, also included discussions on Ukraine’s proposal to store US liquefied natural gas in its facilities.Before the lunch, Trump briefly joked about Zelenskyy’s “very stylish jacket,” referring to their earlier tense February meeting where the two had clashed on live television.Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his Middle East ceasefire efforts and urged him to use that to help end the war in Ukraine. “With your support, we can stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Their army and economy are weakened, and this is a crucial moment.” He also noted that he had met with American energy and defence companies “ready to assist after the attacks on our infrastructure.”Trump, who has frequently described himself as a peacemaker, said, “I solved eight wars. I’ve saved millions and millions of lives.” Referring to India and Pakistan, he added, “That would have been a bad one. But we solved it.” He said he hoped to make Ukraine “number nine.”After meeting Zelenskyy, Trump took to Truth Social to call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. Trump said it is time to let each side “claim victory” and allow history to judge. He added that the war would never have started under his leadership and urged leaders to bring troops home so families can live in peace.He wrote: ""The meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was very interesting, and cordial, but I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide! No more shooting, no more Death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE, GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!""Speaking to journalists outside the White House after meeting President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think that Russia is afraid about Tomahawks, really afraid, because it’s a strong weapon.”","US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"US to hike tariff on Colombia, calls Petro a ‘lunatic’ — will Trump’s aid freeze push relations to the brink?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-hike-tariff-on-colombia-calls-petro-a-lunatic-will-trumps-aid-freeze-push-relations-to-the-brink/articleshow/124697926.cms,"Will aid cuts and new tariffs affect US-Colombia relations?

How ties strained between US and Colombia?







US President Donald Trump said on Sunday night he would raise tariffs on Colombia and stop all payments to the South American nation.Calling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro a lunatic, Trump said that the country has become a drug manufacturing machine, and he is doing nothing to stop the production.While talking to reporters, Trump said, ""They are a drug manufacturing machine, Colombia, and we're not going to be part of it. So we're going to drop all money that we're giving to them. They have, it has nothing to do with them stopping drug production.""""And you look at the fields. The fields are loaded up with drugs, and they refine the drugs and they make tremendous amounts of cocaine, and they send it all over the world and they destroy families. No, Colombia is out of control. And now they have the worst president they've ever had. He's a lunatic who's got a lot of problems, mental problems,"" he added.When asked about the Lindsey Graham's claim that US will slap tariff on Colombia in coming days, Trump said that he read his statement and it is ""correct."" and added that he will announce on Monday.The move escalates tensions between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America.In a social media post, Trump described Petro as “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” The Republican president warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely.”Petro, who is active on social media, rejected Trump’s accusations and defended his efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia, the world’s largest exporter of cocaine, AP news agency reported.“Trying to promote peace in Colombia is not being a drug trafficker,” Petro wrote. He suggested Trump was being deceived by his advisers, described himself as “the main enemy” of drugs in his country, and accused Trump of being “rude and ignorant toward Colombia.”The Colombian Foreign Ministry characterised Trump’s statement as a “direct threat to national sovereignty by proposing an illegal intervention in Colombian territory.”Trump’s latest remarks against Petro heighten the possibility of an expanding clash in Latin America, where the U.S. has already increased pressure on neighbouring Venezuela and its leader, Nicolás Maduro.American naval ships, fighter jets and drones are deployed in the region for what the administration has described as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. Trump also authorised covert operations inside Venezuela.Unlike Venezuela, Colombia is a longtime U.S. ally and the top recipient of American assistance in the region. However, coca cultivation reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations, and there has been renewed violence in rural areas where the govt spent years battling insurgents before reaching a peace deal a decade ago.In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia received an estimated Rs 1,909 crore in the U.S. budget year that ended September 30, a drop from recent years that exceeded Rs 5,810 crore, according to U.S. figures.Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, has repeatedly feuded with Trump this year. Petro initially rejected US military flights of deported migrants, leading Trump to threaten tariffs. The State Department stated it would revoke Petro’s visa when he attended the UN General Assembly in New York because he told American soldiers to disobey Trump’s orders.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday night he would raise tariffs on Colombia and stop all payments to the South American nation.

Cairo hosts urgent talks to advance ceasefire





Gaza’s week-old ceasefire — brokered by the US to end two years of relentless war — came under its first major strain on Sunday. Israeli forces launched a series of deadly airstrikes across the enclave after accusing Hamas militants of ambushing troops in Rafah and killing two soldiers.The strikes, which Gaza officials said killed at least 36 Palestinians including children, briefly halted the transfer of humanitarian aid before both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire.US President Donald Trump said the truce “remains in place” but acknowledged “some shooting” by Hamas, while Egypt and other mediators worked urgently to prevent the situation from spiralling back into war.Here are 10 things to know about the latest developments in Gaza amid the fragile truce with Israel:The Israeli military said it carried out widespread air and artillery strikes after Hamas fighters allegedly opened fire on its troops in Rafah, within areas under Israeli control as per the ceasefire map.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets struck “dozens of terror targets” and used over 120 munitions to destroy a six-kilometre-long underground tunnel network belonging to Hamas.Footage released by the IDF showed troops striking multiple sites across the Gaza Strip, with plumes of fire and smoke rising from the targeted areas.In an official statement, the military said, ""The IDF attacked dozens of terror targets of the Hamas terror organization in the Gaza Strip.The IDF, led by the Southern Command, attacked in recent hours using fighter jets and aircraft of the Air Force and artillery, dozens of terror targets of the Hamas terror organization throughout the Gaza Strip, following the violation of a ceasefire agreement earlier today.""The IDF added that the underground route it struck was used by Hamas “to advance terror plans against the State of Israel.”The IDF also said its forces identified several armed militants moving toward troops in the Beit Lahiya area, beyond the designated “yellow line,” and struck them after they crossed it in violation of the ceasefire.Hamas rejected Israel’s claims, saying it had no active units in Rafah and that communication with its fighters there had been cut for months. The group accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of “violating the ceasefire” to justify renewed attacks.Health officials in Gaza reported at least 36 deaths, including children and women, in strikes across central and southern areas.Al-Awda hospital said it received 24 bodies from Israeli attacks on the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps. Another strike on a coffeehouse in Zawaida killed six people, while four, including two children, died in Khan Younis.According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, over 68,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began in October 2023. The toll includes both civilians and fighters. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages in the initial assault. Thousands remain missing in Gaza, and famine and disease continue to stalk the battered enclave as fragile diplomacy hangs in the balance.An Israeli security official confirmed that aid shipments into Gaza were paused following the escalation. Deliveries will resume on Monday, he said, adding that the temporary halt was due to “security considerations.” The Rafah crossing with Egypt — the only one not controlled by Israel before the war — remains closed “until further notice.”US President Donald Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One, insisted that the ceasefire “remains in place” but admitted Hamas had been “quite rambunctious.” ""They (Hamas) have been doing some shooting, and we think maybe the leadership isn't involved in that — that it's some rebels within — but either way... it's going to be handle toughly, but properly.""Vice President JD Vance said on Sunday that he might travel to Israel soon to “check on how things are going.” He described the ceasefire as entering a stage of “fits and starts,” reflecting the administration’s cautious optimism about the truce’s endurance.Vance says that a member of the Trump administration was “certainly” going to visit Israel “in the next few days” to monitor the situation. He does not confirm who that would be, but says, “it might be me.”The Israeli government on Sunday overwhelmingly approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to rename the Gaza conflict “The War of Revival,” replacing the previous title, “Swords of Iron"", reported Times of Israel.The move, backed by Defense Minister Israel Katz, has stirred controversy, with critics accusing Netanyahu of trying to distance himself from responsibility for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 Hamas assault that ignited the war.Although the official name has now changed, many Israelis continue to refer to the conflict simply as the “October 7 war.”Seven recently released hostages were discharged from Sheba Medical Center and greeted by crowds waving Israeli and American flags, as reported by Times of Israel.Among them were the Cunio brothers, the Berman twins, and survivors of the Nova music festival attack. Their joyful reunions — marked by dancing, singing, and emotional speeches — underscored the deep public relief after two years of anguish.Israel identified two more hostages — Ronen Engel from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Thai agricultural worker Sonthaya Oakkharasri — whose remains were handed over by Hamas.Both were believed killed during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the war. So far, Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies agreed upon under the ceasefire deal.Egypt, which helped broker the truce, is leading “round-the-clock” talks with Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Cairo.Negotiators are working to stabilise the situation and move toward the next phase of the ceasefire — which includes Hamas’s disarmament, Israeli troop withdrawal from more areas, and the creation of an internationally backed governing authority for Gaza.","US President Donald Trump said the truce “remains in place” but acknowledged “some shooting” by Hamas.

Was this another plot to assassinate Trump?







US President Donald Trump boarded Air Force One via a small stairway on Sunday at Palm Beach International Airport due to “increased security measures,” a White House official told Fox News.The heightened precautions followed the Secret Service’s discovery on Friday of a suspected elevated hunting stand near the airport with a clear line of sight to the presidential plane. No individuals were present or arrested at the site.FBI Director Kash Patel stated that his agency is leading the investigation. Patel said the hunting stand has not yet been connected to any individual.""Prior to the President’s return to West Palm Beach, USSS discovered what appeared to be an elevated hunting stand within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone,"" Patel told Fox News Digital.""No individuals were located at the scene.

The first occurred in July during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire at Trump from a rooftop. Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service agents.The second attempt took place in September while Trump was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ryan Routh, 59, concealed himself in the shrubbery near the course in what prosecutors called a plot to kill the then-presidential candidate. Secret Service agents discovered Routh before Trump arrived, leading to his arrest.These incidents highlight the ongoing security challenges surrounding the president amid heightened threats.Additionally, this investigation comes weeks after Ryan Routh was found guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump on a Palm Beach golf course from a sniper's nest he set up in bushes along a fence line.","US President Donald Trump boarded Air Force One via a small stairway on Sunday at Palm Beach International Airport due to “increased security measures,” a White House official said.

Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.This led to many condemnations, including that of Indian-origin Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who called the restrictions an attack on press freedom and slammed US defence secretary Pete HegsethSubramanyam posted his official statement on X, “My statement on the Administration's attacks on the First Amendment and the Pentagon Press Corps.” He also said, “Make no mistake, Secretary Hegseth's attempts to restrict reporters are an attack on freedom of the press, the First Amendment, and our democracy. The American people deserve transparency through accurate and fair reporting. Rather than attacking the messengers of his failed policies, Secretary Hegseth should instead consider doing more to support servicemembers and their families and keep our country safe.”The walkout followed new rules imposed by Hegseth that would allow the Pentagon to expel journalists for reporting on information that had not been approved for release. News organisations rejected the rules, calling them a threat to independent reporting. They see the rules as a way to spoon-feed information and control the narrative.Reporters began leaving; they carried chairs, documents, copying machines, books, and old photos to the parking lot as they handed in their badges.Around 40 to 50 journalists left the Pentagon together, reports the Associated Press.Hegseth has previously limited access to many areas of the Pentagon, held only two formal press briefings, and launched investigations into leaks to the media. He described the new rules as “common sense.""US President Donald Trump backed the new policy, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday, “I think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace. The press is very dishonest.”Several reporters posted on social media when they turned in their badges. Heather Mongilio of USNINews wrote, “It’s such a tiny thing, but I was really proud to see my picture up on the wall of Pentagon correspondents. Today, I’ll hand in my badge. The reporting will continue.”NPR reporter Tom Bowman noted that sources will continue to provide crucial information. “With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters. No one should think that’s good enough,” he said.The Pentagon Press Association, representing 101 reporters from 56 news outlets, opposed the rules. Most organisations instructed their reporters to leave rather than submit.","Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.

US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in to defend US defence secretary Pete Hegseth after social media was grilling him over the colour of his tie during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The row began when photos from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting at the White House showed Hegseth wearing a tie in white, blue, and red — colours that some claimed resembled the Russian tricolour flag.The photos went viral, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Special Envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, sharing Hegseth’s photo on social media alongside a Russian flag emoji, adding fuel to the fire.Vance responded to the continuous trolling on social media, slamming critics who were reading too much into the tie’s design. “Or maybe he was wearing the colors of America,” he said on X, reposting commentary from American YouTuber and former US Army officer Jake Broe, who was among the first ones to share the viral image and claiming that ""these people love Putin and Russia.""Despite Vance’s defence, most netizens remained unconvinced. Commenters argued that if the tie truly represented the American flag, it should have included stars or a different pattern.Some users even dug up an online listing for what appeared to be the same tie, described in the product details as a “Russian plain flag tie,” adding to the speculation.The photo was captured during Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on Thursday, when he met US President Donald Trump for talks that included a public briefing and a private lunch. Trump later said he intended to work with Ukraine to persuade Putin to end the war, but confirmed that Kyiv would not receive Tomahawk missiles.Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said Russia had launched drone and missile attacks on energy and transport infrastructure ahead of winter, targeting power stations, substations, and railway lines.","US Vice President JD Vance responds to criticism of Pete Hegseth's tie.

Zelenskyy urges allies against appeasing Russia







Behind closed-door meetings at White House, US President Donald Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to accept Vladimir Putin’s terms to end the war, warning that Russia would “destroy” Ukraine if it refused.The meeting between the US and Ukrainian leaders on Friday descended several times into a “shouting match”, with Trump “cursing all the time”, according to Financial Times.In the meeting, US president discarded maps of the frontline in Ukraine, insisted Zelenskyy surrender the entire Donbas region to Putin, and repeatedly echoed talking points that the Russian leader had made during their call the day before.The meeting occurred amid a renewed push by Trump to end Russia’s war following the ceasefire secured between Israel and Hamas. Zelenskyy and his team visited the White House hoping to persuade Trump to supply them with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. However, the US president ultimately declined to do so.During Friday’s meeting, Trump appeared to have adopted many of Putin’s talking points verbatim, even when they contradicted his own recent statements about Russia’s weaknesses, European officials briefed on the meeting said.According to a European official with knowledge of the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy that Putin had told him the conflict was a “special operation, not even a war”, adding that the Ukrainian leader needed to cut a deal or face destruction.The official said that Trump told Zelenskyy he was losing the war, warning: “If [Putin] wants it, he will destroy you.”At one point in the meeting, the US president threw Ukraine’s maps of the battlefield aside, the official familiar with the encounter said.According to the official, Trump said he was “sick” of seeing the map of the frontline of Ukraine repeatedly. “This red line, I don’t even know where this is. I’ve never been there,” Trump said, according to the official.Trump also said that Russia’s economy is “doing great”, the official said, in a sharp contrast to his recent public remarks in which he urged Putin to negotiate because his “economy is going to collapse”.Trump appeared influenced by a Thursday call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Putin proposed a territorial swap.According to The Washington Post, the plan would see Ukraine cede the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in exchange for small parts of the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.US officials presented essentially the same swap to Zelenskyy during a Friday meeting. Ukrainians view the territories they still control in Donetsk and Luhansk as strategically critical, warning that surrendering them would leave the rest of Ukraine far more vulnerable to Russian offensives. One official described giving up western Donetsk and Luhansk as akin to “suicide.”Reuters reported that US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff was among the officials most forcefully pushing Ukraine to accept the proposal. Witkoff reportedly emphasized that Donetsk and Luhansk have large Russian-speaking populations, a point he has made publicly in previous statements.Zelenskyy on Sunday called on allies not to appease Russia, following a US trip in which he failed to secure long-range Tomahawk missile supplies.Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington hoping to leverage growing US frustration with Putin after a stalled summit in Alaska. However, he left empty-handed as President Donald Trump pursues a fresh diplomatic breakthrough following last week’s Gaza ceasefire.“Ukraine will never grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes, and we count on our partners to uphold this very position,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media upon returning home. He also called for “decisive steps” from European and American allies and urged another meeting of the European-led “coalition of the willing.”Recent data from Germany’s Kiel Institute shows foreign military support to Ukraine fell by 43% in July and August compared with the first half of the year. The decline is partly attributed to Nato's Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), which pools European contributions for US-made weapons but excludes direct American financing.","US President Donald Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to accept Vladimir Putin’s terms to end the war.

The controversial report on Hindutva in America







The Hindu American Foundation expressed its objection to an upcoming conference sponsored by Rutgers University targeting the Hindu American community in the United States and asked the university to dissociate itself from the event. The event titled 'Hindutva in America: A threat to Equality and Religious Pluralism' will be held on October 27 to discuss a report that was released six months ago. The report called Hindutva in America an 'ethnonationalist threat' to equality and religious pluralism.The Hindu American Foundation issued an open letter addressing the university, asking it to distance from the event. The HAF said that the report equates Hindutva with white supremacy or fascism and calls HAF a proxy of the RSS. ""HAF is not a proxy or affiliate of the RSS< an Indian organization considered to be the parent of the current ruling party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party. The report's claims of ideological and ongoing programmatic ties between HAF and such groups are categorically false,"" the letter said.The HAF urged the university to clarify that they do not endorse what the speakers at the anti-Hindu conference would say, withdraw official logos from the event.""As we gather with our families for Diwali, we are hearing from so many shocked and outraged by @RUCSRR @saharazizlawhosting a conference that blatantly seeks to dismantle Hindu American institutions, including HAF,"" HAF director Suhag Shukla wrote.The report published by Rutgers Center for Security Race and Rights says Hindutva is not Hindism.

There are lessons from Nixon era in Trump's bid to freeze spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/there-are-lessons-from-nixon-era-in-trumps-bid-to-freeze-spending/articleshow/124692849.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Before President Donald Trump asserted that he had the constitutional power to refuse to release money that Congress had directed him to spend, another president made that same bold claim. It did not end well. ""The constitutional right for the president to impound funds,"" President Richard Nixon said at a 1973 news conference, was ""absolutely clear.""Nixon said he had the unilateral right to block - or impound - billions of dollars that Congress had appropriated for medical research, higher education, public housing, the environment and other projects.In that era, Congress, jealous of its place in the constitutional structure, pushed back, enacting the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to protect its power of the purse. Weakened by the Watergate scandal that would cause his resignation that year, Nixon signed the bill.In the second Trump administration, though, impoundments are back, in one of many signs that President Trump is trying to shift power over all facets of American life from Congress to the presidency.He is following through on a campaign promise to wage an assault on the Nixon-era law - one that can likely only be settled by the Supreme Court . ""This disaster of a law is clearly unconstitutional, a blatant violation of the separation of powers,"" Trump said in 2023.""Bringing back impoundment,"" he added, ""will give us a tool with which to obliterate the deep state, drain the swamp and starve the warmongers.""The Impoundment Control Act reinforced what its sponsors said the Constitution required: that the president must faithfully execute congressional commands, including those concerning spending. Among other things, the law required presidents to ask Congress for permission before refusing to spend, or ""rescinding,"" appropriated funds. The law gave Congress the choice of whether to grant those requests through new law. Later presidents followed the procedure, and Congress granted many, though not all, rescission requests.The Constitution gives Congress the primary role in govt spending, saying that ""no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law."" It requires the president to execute the laws faithfully.In asking the Supreme Court last month to let the Trump administration cancel more than $4 billion in foreign aid, D John Sauer, the solicitor general, said he was not pressing a constitutional challenge to the law. Rather, he said the law placed limits on who can sue over it and for what. In an unsigned opinion over the dissents of the three liberal justices, the court sided with the administration.Aided by a pliant Congress, Trump has thus far made good on his campaign pledge to use impoundments aggressively. The breadth of Trump's claimed power is particularly salient given the shutdown, said Alan Morrison, a law professor at George Washington University who has filed briefs opposing the Trump administration's spending freezes. In ending earlier shutdowns, Morrison said, the two parties made a deal and enacted legislation reflecting it. But now, he said, expansive use of impoundments undercuts Democrats' motivation to compromise. ""This time,"" he added, ""if you have a deal, the Democrats know that Trump is going to impound all what they want and spend all the things they don't want.""","Nixon said he had the unilateral right to block - or impound - billions of dollars. Congress, jealous of its place in the constitutional structure, pushed back.

A son’s certainty, a father’s hesitation





The shadow of Fred Trump

Too Much and Never Enough

Lessons of ambition, loss, and privilege











Embodying the father

The moral reckoning





If Donald Trump’s late-stage efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine, mediate conflicts in the Middle East, and save lives are tied to a biblical reckoning, they would be framed by two stark verses: Romans 3:23,and James 2:17,In the twilight of his life, Trump confronts this moral ledger in ways few expected. While his son Eric insists that his father is heaven-bound, Trump himself harbors profound reservations, not only about his own eternal fate, but even about whether his father, Fred Trump, has earned a place among the saved. Forged under the relentless ambition, exacting expectations, and ruthless example of his father, these late acts of what could be called redemption are a conscious attempt to rewrite the moral account by which he fears he will ultimately be judged, a personal reckoning, a bid for grace, and a recognition that judgment, ultimately, belongs to God alone.“I don’t think there’s anything going to get me in heaven. I think I’m not maybe heaven bound. I may be in heaven right now as we fly in Air Force One, I’m not sure. I’m going to be able to make heaven. But I’ve made life a lot better for a lot of people,” Donald Trump admitted aboard Air Force One as he traveled to Egypt to attend a peace summit, revealing a level of doubt few would expect from a man so accustomed to certainty.This is not the first time he has questioned his eternal fate.Earlier in candid interviews with Fox News interviews, he said, “I want to try and get to heaven if possible… I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I hear I’m really at the bottom of the totem pole.”In parallel, his son Eric shows no such doubt. In a recent appearance on the Benny Show podcast, he confidently insisted his father is heaven-bound, saying, “Make no mistake, he is heaven-bound.” a certainty that seems almost naive compared with his father’s own wavering reflections.Trump’s efforts to end conflicts around the world, including mediating the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and engaging with Ukrainian and Russian leaders, reflect his attempt at moral accounting. While the Nobel Peace Prize has eluded him for these interventions, he now looks to spiritual redemption and eternity as a consolation, framing his global peace efforts as part of a larger, existential wager. As he told Fox News, “If I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons. ""Perhaps the more troubling idea is his view of his father’s fate. At a rally in Madison Square Garden in October, Trump reflected on his parents and his own fate, saying, “Now my beautiful parents are up in heaven, I think they are. They're up there, looking down. They say, 'How did this happen to my son?’ I know my mother's in heaven. I'm not 100% sure about my father, but it's close.” So why the shadow of doubt? Why does Donald Trump think his father may not be in heaven?Donald Trump’s relationship with his father, Fred Sr., was never ordinary. It was a crucible of power, control, and expectation—one that left lasting imprints on the younger Trump’s psyche. Fred Sr. ruled his household and business empire with meticulous rigor and a sharp moral code of winning at all costs. Mary Trump, a trained psychologist and Donald’s first niece, offers a piercing memoir in her book titled:, exposing the family’s inner workings and the psychological toll of living under Fred Sr.’s dominance. She characterizes Fred Sr. as a “high-functioning sociopath,” shaping his children through relentless discipline and a transactional lens on life. Donald, she writes, was effectively the “second choice,” following his older brother Fred Jr., whose charisma and position as the heir apparent initially drew his father’s focus.Watching Fred Jr. struggle and ultimately succumb to alcoholism at the age of 42, Donald internalized a brutal lesson: weakness invites ruin. The family saga made it clear that survival—professional, personal, and perhaps moral—required discipline, aggression, and an unflinching drive to win. Marc Fisher of The Washington Post observes that even in early childhood, Donald learned to see the world through the prism of his father’s business: collecting rents in Brooklyn and Queens, navigating political favors at local Democratic clubs, and prioritizing results above all else. In this world, relationships were secondary, compassion was optional, and victory was nonnegotiable.Yet wealth and privilege were never absent from this equation. From the start, Donald and his siblings were heirs to a vast fortune. Mary Trump’s research highlights that even as a toddler, Donald was already receiving substantial sums from his father’s various trusts, reaching millions annually well into adulthood. Money insulated him, but it did not soften the relentless moral calculus imposed by Fred Sr., a man whose life revolved around winning, influence, and the bottom line, often bending rules and skirting conventional ethics to achieve his aims.It is this very philosophy that Donald Trump internalized and embodied, both in action and worldview. As he expanded the family real estate empire and cultivated his persona as a mogul, he applied the same playbook: intimidation, coercion, and bending—or breaking—the rules were tools, not transgressions, all in service of the singular objective he had inherited from his father: winning.Compounding these lessons were the personal losses and traumas that punctuated his upbringing. Donald’s mother, Mary Anne Trump, was perfunctorily attentive before health crises rendered her largely absent, creating a profound emotional void. Observing his older brother Fred Jr.’s downward spiral and early death at 42, as well as his younger brother Robert Trump’s quieter struggles in life and business, and navigating the rigid household rules instilled by both parents, Donald was forced to confront the fragility of human life and character. Even in his youthful displays of aggression—pushing classmates around, wielding a broomstick against disobedient peers, and later thriving in the strict confines of the New York Military Academy—Trump’s behavior reflected both the internalization of his father’s philosophy and a defensive posture shaped by trauma, a biographer Stephen Mansfield notes. It was a life lived under constant calculation: assert dominance, secure loyalty, and never expose weakness. Mary Trump observes that these early experiences, emotional neglect, exposure to familial suffering, and the shadow of mortality, helped forge Donald’s sense of existential caution and a profound, if complicated, moral pragmatismIt is against this backdrop that Trump’s doubts about his father’s ultimate fate become comprehensible. He saw Fred Sr. as a man of extraordinary ambition and wealth, but also of ruthless pragmatism and transactional morality—a figure who broke rules to win, amassed vast riches, and wielded power with little concern for fairness or sentiment. The fortune he inherited, the lessons of relentless drive, and the vivid example of a brother destroyed by weakness left him with a lingering question: could a man so focused on victory and wealth ever be judged as just? And if his father might not be in heaven, could he himself escape the same fate? Having lost his mother early and never fully known her in life, Trump expresses certainty that she is in heaven, but remains unsure about his father. Donald’s candid doubts about his own eternal fate take on a chilling logic: having modeled himself so closely after Fred Sr., he fears inheriting not just his father’s wealth and influence, but also his spiritual liabilities.","In the twilight of his life, Donald Trump confronts this moral ledger in ways few expected.

Trump Losing Allies In U.S. Backyard After ‘Sub’ Attack? Petro Explodes | 'Troops Sedated Colombian'





US President Donald Trump lashed out at Colombia ’s leader, Gustavo Petro, calling him “an illegal drug leader” and announcing that the United States will cut all aid to the South American nation. Trump made the declaration on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, accusing Petro of encouraging “the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Columbia (sic). ”The 47th POTUS, wrote: “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The move marks the latest sign of tension between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. Colombia is the world’s largest exporter of cocaine, with coca cultivation hitting record levels last year, according to the United Nations.The Trump administration had previously accused Bogotá of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although a waiver issued in September temporarily avoided sanctions.The announcement comes amid controversy over a series of U.S. military strikes in Caribbean waters targeting suspected drug traffickers. Earlier this week, Trump claimed credit for destroying a “very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE” carrying fentanyl and other narcotics. “There were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel. Two of the terrorists were killed,” he wrote, adding that the remaining two survivors, from Ecuador and Colombia, would be returned “for detention and prosecution. ” He estimated that the interdiction potentially saved “at least 25,000 Americans.”Petro has sharply criticised the strikes, accusing the United States of killing an innocent Colombian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, in a September 16 attack. Petro wrote on X: “The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar’s homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs.” He has demanded legal action and explanations from the U.S. government.While Washington insists the operations are targeting narcotics traffickers, evidence linking the victims to drug smuggling has not been publicly provided.
