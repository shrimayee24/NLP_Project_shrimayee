Trump team says it raised $52.8m in 24 hours post verdict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-team-says-it-raised-52-8m-in-24-hours-post-verdict/articleshow/110631189.cms,"AFP file photo

Donald Trump 's campaign says it raised $52.8 million after a Manhattan jury delivered a guilty verdict in his hush-money trial . Donors contributed that sum in the 24 hours after the verdict was announced.

Both Trump and President Joe Biden 's campaigns sent out fundraising solicitations after the jury Thursday found the presumptive Republican nominee guilty on all 34 counts of mishandling business records to cover up payments to an adult film actress. The $52.8 million fundraising haul is a massive sum for a single day.

On Monday morning, a unique astronomical phenomenon will be observed from most parts of the world, including Goa. Sun , Moon , and all planets (except Earth) will align in the eastern dawn sky. Only Earth will be on the western side of Sun, with the other planets grouped in the east.To enable the people of Goa to view this phenomenon, the public astronomical observatory in Panaji will be kept open to the public from 5am to 6am on June 3. Entry will be free, said Satish Nayak of the Association of Friends of Astronomy (Goa).“On Monday, June 3, Saturn rises at 1.10am in the east, followed by the crescent moon rising at 2.30am. Neptune will be exactly between these two. After the rising of Mars at 3.10am, the next to be visible on the horizon will be Mercury and Jupiter by 5.25am. Uranus will be above Mercury. Finally, as the Sun and Venus rise together at 6am, sunlight will block out the whole arrangement,” said Nayak.With the phenomenon happening at dawn, given the ambient sunlight along with expected cloudy skies and isolated thunderstorm forecasts, there will be little chance of observing this entire alignment , he said.“For those interested in viewing this, the clearest objects in this alignment — Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn in order — will be visible with the naked eye starting from very low east to zenith around 5.30am, subject to clear skies. No telescope or binoculars are needed to view these.”","On Monday morning, a unique astronomical phenomenon will be observed from most parts of the world, including Goa.

South Africa election ends three decades of ANC dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-africa-election-ends-three-decades-of-anc-dominance/articleshow/110631423.cms,"'We all are talking'

JOHANNESBURG: South Africans angry at joblessness, inequality and power shortages have slashed support for the African National Congress ( ANC ) to 40% in this week's election, ending three decades of dominance by the party that freed the country from apartheid.A dramatically weakened mandate for the legacy party of Nelson Mandela , down from the 57.5% it got in the previous 2019 parliamentary election, means the ANC must share power with a rival in order to keep it - an unprecedented prospect.""We can talk to everybody and anybody,"" Gwede Mantashe, the ANC chair and current mines and energy minister, told reporters in comments carried by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), dodging a question about who the party was discussing a possible coalition deal with.Vote tallying from Wednesday's poll was entering its final stages on Saturday, with results from 99.53% of polling stations giving the ANC 40.21%.The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 21.80%, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a new party led by former president Jacob Zuma, managed to grab 14.60%, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, got 9.48%.""We have achieved our mission: ... to bring the ANC below 50%. We want to humble the ANC,"" Malema told journalists at the results centre.""We are going to negotiate with the ANC"" for a possible coalition deal, he said, although that would not be quite enough to clinch a majority without including another party on the current count.The ANC has won every previous national election by a landslide since the historic 1994 vote that ended white minority rule, but over the last decade its support has dwindled as the economy stagnated, unemployment rose and roads and power stations crumbled.MK's strong performance, especially in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, is one of the main reasons the ANC failed to secure a majority.Analysts say one option for the ANC could be a ""government of national unity"" involving a broad spectrum of many parties, rather than a formal coalition between a few - an arrangement similar the one set up after 1994's historic all-race vote.Malema said the EFF was against that idea and preferred to be part of a coalition.Political parties' share of the vote determine their seats in the National Assembly, which elects the nation's president.Investors in Africa's most industrialised economy will hope the uncertain picture can quickly become clear and that the country avoids an extended period of wrangling if the main political players struggle to agree how they can cooperate.Some parties have questioned what they say are vote-counting inconsistencies that may lead to some results being contested.Electoral commission chair Mosotho Moepya told a news conference on Saturday that ""every concern raised in these objections will be considered and we will do so carefully"".ANC First Deputy Secretary-General Nomvula Mokonyane meanwhile urged voters and communities to remain peaceful.Despite the ANC's result, President Cyril Ramaphosa could still keep his job, as the former liberation movement was on course to get about twice as many votes as the next party. But he will be weakened and could face calls to quit both from opposition parties and critics in the deeply-divided ANC.On Friday, however, Mokonyane - one of the ANC's top officials - backed him to stay on as party leader, and analysts say he has no obvious successor.A deal to keep the ANC in the presidency could involve opposition backing in exchange either for cabinet posts or for more control of parliament, perhaps even the speaker.""One of the positions we are going to demand from the ANC is ... the speaker of parliament,"" Malema said.The election commission has pencilled in a final results announcement for Sunday.","The African National Congress ( ANC ) got 40% of the vote, down from 57.5% in previous election. The ANC must share power with a rival in order to keep it - an unprecedented prospect.

Biden says Israel has offered to Hamas a three-step road map to an enduring ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-israel-has-offered-to-hamas-a-three-step-road-map-to-an-enduring-ceasefire/articleshow/110603765.cms,"The first phase would involve a six-week ceasefire, during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza, and hostages, including the elderly and women, would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian civilians would return to Gaza, including northern Gaza, and 600 trucks would deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza daily.

In the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate the terms of a permanent end to hostilities. ""The ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue,"" the president said.

The third phase would involve a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden on Friday said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, and urged Hamas to accept the new offer, stating that it was the most effective way to end the ongoing conflict.""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is facing pressure during an election year to bring the eight-month-long Gaza conflict to a close.Despite mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar, and others, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with both sides accusing each other of hindering progress. Neither the Israeli prime minister's office nor Hamas immediately responded to Biden's comments.The new proposal outlined by Biden on Friday consists of three phases.According to Biden, the proposal has been relayed to Hamas by Qatar.The president appealed to those in Israel who are advocating for an ""indefinite"" war ""indefinite"" to change their minds.""I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition. They've made it clear. They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" Biden said.""As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost. We can't lose this moment,"" he added.Several Israeli media outlets described Biden's speech as dramatic and interpreted it as an attempt to directly appeal to the Israeli public. Channel 12, a leading news channel, interrupted its evening news show to broadcast Biden's speech live. According to anchor Danny Kushmaro, Israel's censor had previously prohibited the publication of the offer's details.An earlier hostage proposal put forward this year called for the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in Gaza in exchange for a six-week ceasefire that could be extended to allow for more aid to be delivered into the enclave. However, the proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Israel refused to agree to Hamas' demand for a permanent end to the war as part of the negotiations and intensified its assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.Hamas on Thursday said that it had informed mediators that it would not participate in further negotiations during ongoing aggression but was prepared for a ""complete agreement,"" including an exchange of hostages and prisoners, if Israel ended the war.According to a US official speaking on condition of anonymity, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet on Friday with diplomats from 17 countries whose citizens are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.A senior Israeli security official stated on Friday that Israel will not agree to any halt in fighting that is not part of a deal that includes the return of surviving hostages.The week has been dominated by the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.","US President Joe Biden said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages.

"US defence secretary says war with China neither imminent nor unavoidable, stressing need for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-defence-secretary-says-war-with-china-neither-imminent-nor-unavoidable-stressing-need-for-talks/articleshow/110613934.cms,"SINGAPORE: United States Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin told a gathering of top security officials Saturday that war with China was neither imminent nor unavoidable, despite rapidly escalating tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, stressing the importance of renewed dialogue between him and his Chinese counterpart in avoiding ""miscalculations and misunderstandings."" Austin's comments at the Shangri-La defence forum in Singapore came the day after he met for more than an hour on the sidelines with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun, the first in-person meeting between the top defence officials since contacts between the American and Chinese militaries broke down in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan , infuriating Beijing.Neither side budged from their longstanding positions on Taiwan - which China claims as its own and has not ruled out using force to take - and on China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea , which has led to direct confrontations between China and other nations in the region, most notably the Philippines.While declining to detail the specifics of their conversation, Austin said the most important thing was that the two were again talking.""As long as we're talking, we're able to identify those issues that are troublesome and that we want to make sure that we have placed guardrails to ensure there are no misperceptions and no miscalculations ... that can spiral out of control,"" he said.""You can only do that kind of thing if you are talking.""Addressing the same forum on Friday night, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr bluntly outlined what could be at stake, saying that if a Filipino were killed as China confronts his country's coast guard and merchant fleet to press its claims in the South China Sea, it would be ""very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly.""Marcos added that he assumed the Philippines' treaty partners, which include the U.S., ""hold the same standard.""In his own speech, Austin lauded how Marcos ""spoke so powerfully last night about how the Philippines is standing up for its sovereign rights under international law."" But when pressed later, he would not say how the US might react if a Filipino were killed in a confrontation with China, calling it hypothetical.He did say the US commitment to the Philippines as a treaty partner is ""ironclad,"" while again stressing the importance of dialogue with China.""There are a number of things that can happen at sea or in the air, we recognize that,"" he said. ""But our goal is to make sure that we don't allow things to spiral out of control unnecessarily.""Beijing in recent years has been rapidly expanding its navy and is becoming growingly assertive in pressing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea.The U.S., meantime, has been ramping up military exercises in the region with its allies to underscore its ""free and open Indo-Pacific "" concept, meant to emphasize freedom of navigation through the contested waters, including the Taiwan Strait.Expressing the concerns of some in the region, Indonesian academic Dewi Fortuna Anwar said any de-escalation of tensions ""would be very welcome to this part of the world,"" but wondered whether the U.S. would allow China's assertive military posture to grow uncontested if Washington's main emphasis was now dialogue.""We are also worried if you guys get too cozy, we also get trampled,"" she said.Austin said that many of those issues were best addressed through talks, but also assured that Washington will continue to ensure that the rights of nations in the region were protected and that they continued to have access to their exclusive economic zones.""War or a fight with China is neither imminent, in my view, or unavoidable,"" Austin said.""Leaders of great power nations need to continue to work together to ensure that we're doing things to reduce the opportunities for miscalculation and misunderstandings,"" he said.

Republicans join Trump's attacks on justice system and campaign of vengeance after guilty verdict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republicans-join-trumps-attacks-on-justice-system-and-campaign-of-vengeance-after-guilty-verdict/articleshow/110611277.cms,"WASHINGTON: Embracing Donald Trump ’s strategy of blaming the US justice system after his historic guilty verdict , Republicans in Congress are fervently enlisting themselves in his campaign of vengeance and political retribution in the GOP bid to reclaim the White House.Almost no Republican official has stood up to suggest Trump should not be the party's presidential candidate for the November election — in fact, some have sought to hasten his nomination. Few others dared to defend the legitimacy of the New York state court that heard the hush money case against the former president, or the 12 jurors who unanimously rendered their verdict.In fact, any Republicans who expressed doubts about Trump's innocence or political viability, including his former hawkish national security adviser John Bolton or top-tier Senate candidate Larry Hogan, were instantly bullied by the former president’s enforcers and told to “leave the party.”Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she's voting for Trump “whether he is a free man or a prisoner of the Biden regime.”The firebrand congresswoman also posted the upside-down American flag that has come to symbolize the “Stop the Steal” movement Trump started with allies before the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.The swift, strident and deepening commitment to Trump despite his felony conviction shows how fully Republican leaders and lawmakers have been infused with his unfounded grievances of a “rigged” system and dangerous conspiracies of “weaponized"" government into their own attacks on President Joe Biden and the Democrats.Rather than shunning Trump's escalating authoritarian language or ensuring they will provide checks and balances for a second Trump term, the Republican senators and representatives are upturning longstanding faith in US governance and setting the stage for what they plan to do if Trump regains power.On Friday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan demanded the prosecutors Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo appear for a June hearing on the “weaponization of the federal government” and “the unprecedented political prosecution” of Trump — despite the fact that Biden, as president, has no authority over the state courts in New York.“What we’re gearing up for is if Trump wins, he’s going to use the apparatus of the state to target his political opponents,” said Jason Stanley, a professor at Yale and the author of “How Fascism Works.”Stanley said history is full of examples of people not believing the rhetoric of authoritarians. “Believe what they say,” he said. “He's literally telling you he’s going to use the apparatus of the state to target his political opponents.""At his Trump Tower on Friday in New York, the former president returned to the kinds of attacks he has repeatedly lodged in campaign speeches, portraying Biden as the one who is a “corrupt” and the US as a “fascist” nation.Trump called the members of the bipartisan House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol “thugs” and said Biden was a “Manchurian candidate,” a phrase inspired by the 1960s movie portraying a puppet of a US political enemy.A Trump campaign memo contained talking points for Republican lawmakers, suggesting they call the case a “sham,” “hoax,” “witch hunt,” “election interference"" and “lawfare” designed by Biden, whom it called “crooked.""Biden faces no such charges, and the House GOP's efforts to impeach the president over his son Hunter Biden's business dealings, have largely stalled out. Hunter Biden is due in court next week on an unrelated firearms charge in Wilmington, Delaware.President Biden said Friday that “it’s reckless, it’s dangerous, it’s irresponsible, for anyone to say this is rigged just because they don’t like the verdict.”Asked later at the White House if this could happen to him, Biden said: “Not at all. I didn’t do anything wrong. The system still works.”As for Trump's claims the case is being orchestrated by the Democratic president to hurt him politically, Biden quipped: “I didn’t know I was that powerful.”In the hush money case, Trump was found guilty of trying to influence the 2016 election by falsifying payment to a porn actor to bury her story of an affair. He faces three other felony indictments, including the federal case over his effort to overturn the 2020 election. But they are not likely to be heard before November’s expected election rematch with Biden.Thursday's verdict came after a jury in 2023 found Trump to be liable for sexual abuse against advice columnist E. Jean Carroll and a judge in a 2024 business fraud case determined that Trump lied about his wealth for years, ordering him to pay a staggering $355 million in penalties.Almost to a person, the Republicans in Congress who spoke out provided a singular voice for Trump.Speaker Mike Johnson on “Fox & Friends” amplified the claim, without evidence, that Democrats are trying to hurt Trump. He said he thinks the Supreme Court should “step in” to resolve the case.“The justices on the court, I know many of them personally, I think they're deeply concerned about that as we are,” the Republican speaker said.The outgoing Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said he expected Trump would win the hush money case on appeal, but the three senators seeking to replace him as leader echoed Trump with stronger criticisms of the judicial system.South Dakota Sen. John Thune said the case was “politically motivated."" Texas Sen. John Cornyn called the verdict “a disgrace."" Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that everyone who calls themselves a party leader “must stand up and condemn” what he called “lawless election interference.”And Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is known as a bipartisan leader, said the prosecutor “brought these charges precisely because of who the defendant was rather than because of any specified criminal conduct.”With sentencing in the hush money case expected in July before the Republican National Convention, Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said the GOP should move up the convention to speed up Trump’s nomination as the party’s presidential pick.Republican judicial advocate Mike Davis, a former top Senate aide mentioned for a future Trump administration position, circulated a letter outlining the next steps.“Dear Republicans,” he said in a Friday post. If their response to the guilty verdict was “we must respect the process” or “we are too principled to retaliate,” he suggested they do two things: One was an expletive, the other: “Leave the party.”Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, circulated his own letter in which he suggested it was the White House that “made a mockery” of the rule of law and altered politics in “un-American” ways. He and other senators threatened to stall Senate business until Republicans take action.“Those who turned our judicial system into a political cudgel must be held accountable,” Lee said.",Republicans in Congress are fervently enlisting themselves in his campaign of vengeance and political retribution in the GOP bid to reclaim the White House. Almost no Republican official has stood up to suggest Trump should not be the party's presidential candidate. Few others dared to defend the legitimacy of the New York state court that heard the hush money case against the former president.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110611424,imgsize-41032,width-400,resizemode-4/110611424.jpg"
Ohio Senate approves fix assuring President Biden is on fall ballot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ohio-senate-approves-fix-assuring-president-biden-is-on-fall-ballot/articleshow/110609642.cms,"A temporary fix allowing President Joe Biden to appear on this fall’s ballot cleared the Ohio Senate on Friday as the Republican-dominated Legislature concluded a rare special session .The vote came one day after the House approved the measure, along with a ban on foreign nationals contributing to state ballot campaigns. The latter measure had been demanded by the Senate, which approved it Friday. Both bills now head to Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who is expected to sign both.The latter bill also broadened the definition of “foreign nationals” to include lawful permanent residents of the U.S., also known as green card holders. The provision was added to the House bill, with proponents saying it would close “a glaring loophole” in the bill, but several lawmakers questioned whether it eventually would lead to the courts striking down the entire measure as unconstitutional.The special session was ostensibly called by DeWine last week to address the fact that Ohio’s deadline for making the November ballot falls on Aug. 7, about two weeks before the Democratic president was set to be formally nominated at the party’s Aug. 19-22 convention in Chicago.But when the Senate — and then DeWine’s proclamation calling lawmakers back to Columbus — tied the issue to the foreign nationals prohibition, the Democratic National Committee moved to neutralize the need for any vote in Ohio. In tandem with the Biden campaign, it announced earlier this week that it would solve Biden’s problem with Ohio’s ballot deadline itself by holding a virtual roll call vote to nominate him. A committee vote on that work-around is set for Tuesday.The Democratic National Committee said Friday that the planned virtual roll call will still move forward.On Thursday, Democrats in the Ohio House had accused the Republican supermajorities in both chambers of exploiting the Biden conundrum to pass an unrelated bill that undermines direct democracy in Ohio, where voters sided against GOP leaders’ prevailing positions by wide margins on three separate ballot measures last year. That included protecting abortion access in the state constitution, turning back a proposal to make it harder to pass such constitutional amendments in the future, and legalizing recreational marijuana.Political committees involved in the former two efforts took money from entities that had received donations over the past decade from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, though any direct path from him to the Ohio campaigns is untraceable under campaign finance laws left unaddressed in the House legislation. Wyss lives in Wyoming.If the foreign nationals legislation does become law, it has the potential to affect ballot issue campaigns making their way toward Ohio’s Nov. 5 ballot. Those include measures proposing changes to Ohio’s redistricting law changes, raising the minimum wage to $15, granting qualified immunity for police and protecting certain voting rights.","Ohio Gov.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz calls some judges 'black sheep'; accuses them of giving relief to Imran Khan



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from former US president Donald Trump , former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that the February national election was rigged , calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate.""Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is being held in solitary confinement, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations and were being ""victimised.""Despite Khan's party winning the most seats in the February election, they fell short of a majority, allowing his opponent Shehbaz Sharif to form a government with the support of allied parties. The top court granted Khan permission to appear and plead petitions he had filed against amendments to the country's anti-graft laws.The Pakistan Muslim League (N) secured 75 seats, the Pakistan People's Party came third with 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has agreed to support them with 17 seats.Imran Khan's defense was similar to that of former US President Donald Trump who on several occasions has also claimed that the 2020 US elections were 'rigged' and 'stolen' by the democrats.Earlier today, a Pakistan court acquitted Imran Khan in two cases related to violence that occurred on May 9. The court cited a lack of sufficient evidence against the 71-year-old founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The verdict was delivered by judicial magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad, who approved the petition challenging the two cases filed at Shehzad Town police station.The court stated in its verdict: ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Last year, following Khan's arrest in an alleged corruption case, his supporters engaged in vandalism targeting public property, including sensitive army installations. This is not the first time Khan has been acquitted in cases connected to the May 9 violence; on May 15, he was also cleared in two other related cases.Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday had accused some serving judges, whom he referred to as ""black sheep,"" of allegedly providing relief to Imran Khan in various cases.""Some black sheep in (the) judiciary are there to save Imran Niazi from 190 billion pounds and other cases. Every day, it is planned how to give him bail in certain cases,"" he said.Shehbaz made these allegations during a general council meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), where his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president.","Imran Khan claims that the February national election was rigged, calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate"" Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations.

Detectives interviewed Ali on Wednesday night.Ali faces more than a dozen charges, including attempted murder , attempted assault, and hate crimes charges. Police do not believe the attack is terror-related and have not found evidence linking him to radical groups online.The attack began as Ali, driving a 2011 white Crown Victoria, turned onto East 55th Street in front of the Mesivta Nachlas Yakov School and suddenly veered toward students in Orthodox attire. He then circled the block and returned, targeting two more students and a rabbi.“I’m gonna kill all the Jews,” Ali allegedly shouted, according to police. The victims managed to run into the building before being struck. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Authorities have listed five victims in the case: three 18-year-olds, a 41-year-old man, and a 44-year-old man.Rabbi Twersky, who works at the Yeshiva, described the chaos as the driver attempted to strike one of the boys at the corner of Glenwood Road and East 55th Street. Ali then drove up the wrong side of East 56th Street and barreled toward a group of 30 to 40 students.“I’m much more scared than they are — their adrenaline is up,” Twersky said.Tire marks on the sidewalk near the Yeshiva remained visible Wednesday night, with a police car stationed outside. Ali initially got away but was quickly located by the Shomrim Safety Patrol, who swarmed the area and found the attacker at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, the NY Post report said.“We were able to retrieve the video footage. We got the guy’s plate number,” said Bob Moskowitz, executive coordinator of the patrol. “Obviously it was a very distinct car, a Crown Vic, an old model. You don’t see too many of those around.”Ali, who has lived in the US for over two decades, was taken into custody and transferred to Coney Island Hospital. He is considered an “emotionally disturbed” person with a prior arrest in 1998 for false personation. He has four prior arrests, including one for criminal impersonation, though details of the other arrests were not immediately clear.“We were very pleased to be able to apprehend this individual,” Moskowitz stated. “This is not somebody that we want driving around the streets, especially with this anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish climate that’s out there. So we were glad to be able to put this to rest. The community was kind of uptight about this. Now everybody can be a little more relaxed.”","Asghar Ali, 58, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force.

Targets included the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the ISI building in Faisalabad. For the first time, the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob.Despite these acquittals, Khan, who is held in the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, faces multiple allegations connected to the violence that erupted after his arrest.","Imran Khan was acquitted in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.

""The exhibition is entirely accessible to the public again.""The spokesperson said however that a criminal complaint would be registered over the latest in a growing number of cultural attacks.The woman, a member of the "" Riposte Alimentaire "" (Food Response) environmental group, was taken into custody for wilful damage, the Paris prosecution service said.In a video posted on X, the former Twitter, the woman is seen placing the red cloth over the Monet painting of a field of red poppies.In the video she warns of the ""nightmarish"" effects of global warming .Monet's painting, completed in 1873, shows people with umbrellas strolling in a blooming poppy field and is part of a special Musee d'Orsay show called ""Paris 1874, Inventing Impressionism"" that features 130 works by 31 artists.Some of Monet's works have sold for tens of millions of dollars, with his painting ""Meules"" (""Haystacks"") fetching more than $110 million at auction in 2019.Riposte Alimentaire has claimed responsibility for several art attacks in France in a bid to draw attention to the climate crisis and deteriorating food quality.In January two protesters from the group hurled soup at the ""Mona Lisa"" painting in the Louvre museum. Leonardo da Vinci's masterwork is covered by bulletproof glass.The attackers were sentenced by a Paris court to carry out volunteer work for a charity organisation.In 2022, a man threw a custard pie at the Mona Lisa because, he said, artists were not focusing enough on ""the planet"".In February, Riposte Alimentaire hurled soup at another Monet painting, ""Springtime"", in Lyon, southeast France.Last month the group's activists stuck flyers around ""Liberty Leading the People"", a painting by Eugene Delacroix in the Louvre.In April, two members were arrested at the Musee d'Orsay, which is dedicated to 19th-century art, suspected of preparing an action there.Riposte Alimentaire calls itself a ""French civil resistance movement which aims to spur a radical societal change for the environment and society"".""We love art,"" the movement has said, ""but future artists will have nothing to paint on a burning planet.""Monet appears to be a favourite target for climate activists elsewhere, too, with paintings by the Impressionist having previously come under attack in Potsdam, Germany, and in Stockholm.","French police arrest a climate activist who staged a protest attack on a priceless Monet painting.

The Financial Times reported Friday that Jon Benjamin was traveling in Sinaloa and Durango, two states in northern Mexico where drug cartels have a significant presence, when the incident occurred. The video posted on the social media platform X shows a man who looks like Benjamin seated in the front seat of a vehicle, when he picks up the supposed rifle and points it at someone in the back seat. The five-second clip was posted by an anonymous user along with the message, “In a context of daily killings in Mexico by drug dealers, he dares to joke.”

While the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office hasn't officially announced any changes at the embassy in Mexico City, the FCDO website no longer lists Benjamin as ambassador.

“We are aware of this incident and have taken appropriate action,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement released in response to questions about the reported incident. “Where internal issues do arise the FCDO has robust HR processes to address them.”

Rachel Brazier has been charge d'affaires at the embassy since April, a role in which a diplomat serves as an embassy's chief of mission in the absence of the ambassador.

UK parliament dissolved ahead of general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-dissolved-ahead-of-general-election/articleshow/110546979.cms,"The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.The election is expected to bring the Labour party back to power after 14 years of Conservative rule. As the clock struck one minute past midnight, all 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant, marking the official commencement of the electoral process.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's election announcement, which took place amidst a heavy downpour, has been seen by many as a shaky start to the campaign, with some interpreting the rain as an ill omen.Sunak's decision to hold the election on July 4, earlier than anticipated, is viewed as an attempt to regain momentum as his party's popularity wanes in opinion polls. Meanwhile, the Labour party, led by former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer, is poised to capitalize on the opportunity to regain power after 14 years in opposition.The ruling Conservative party is not only trailing significantly behind Labour in the polls but also facing a mass exodus of parliamentarians. An unprecedented 129 MPs, including 77 Conservatives, have announced their decision not to seek re-election, reflecting the bleak prospects of victory for the governing party. Some Tory MPs have expressed frustration at being caught off guard by the July election date, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker opting to continue his vacation in Greece while preparing his campaign remotely.Despite Sunak's efforts to promote the Conservatives as the ""safe"" option during his campaign travels across the country, his campaign has encountered some early setbacks. A visit to the site where the Titanic was built drew comparisons between his leadership and captaining a sinking ship. Sunak's campaign has focused on appealing to older voters and right-wing supporters, with pledges to bring back national service and a substantial tax break for pensioners. However, these efforts have done little to boost the party's favor, with polls indicating a significant lead for Labour.Labour, on the other hand, is aiming to capitalize on the public's fatigue with the Conservatives, who have seen five prime ministers since 2016, along with numerous scandals and economic challenges. The party has sought to position itself as the ""natural party of business,"" garnering the support of 120 industry leaders this week. Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, Labour has shifted towards the center in an attempt to win back voters, including by expelling former leader Jeremy Corbyn and taking steps to address anti-Semitism within the party.However, the past week has also exposed long-standing factional divisions within Labour, with MP Diane Abbott expressing dismay at the party's desire to bar her from candidacy. Starmer has faced criticism from leftist voters who accuse him of backtracking on promises made during his successful leadership campaign. As the campaign progresses, both parties will need to navigate internal challenges while presenting a compelling vision to the electorate.(With AFP inputs)","The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.

NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old British man caused a disturbance on an easyJet flight from London's Gatwick Airport to Alicante-Elche Miguel Hernandez in southern Spain on Thursday.

According to Spanish news outlet informacion.es, the man, who was not identified, boarded the plane intoxicated and became increasingly inebriated due to ""altitude.""

The man's aggressive behaviour led to a physical altercation with other passengers. When crew members intervened to de-escalate the situation, the man allegedly assaulted them as well, forcing the staff to physically restrain him.

As the aircraft approached its destination, the intoxicated passenger, apparently unaware that the plane was still airborne, attempted ""to get off quicker"" by trying to open an airplane door.

The pilot alerted the control tower and reported the incident to Civil Guard officers upon landing.

The man was subsequently arrested, although the specific charges he faces remain unclear as of Friday.
