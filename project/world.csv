NEW DELHI: At least 28 students of Jawaharlal Nehru University JNU ), including student union (JNUSU) president Nitesh Kumar, were detained on Saturday evening after a protest outside the campus turned confrontational, Delhi Police said.According to the police, around 70–80 students, including women, gathered near the university’s West Gate around 6 pm. Barricades had been placed to restrict their movement towards Nelson Mandela Marg.“Despite repeated requests, the students forcefully pushed through and broke the barricades, manhandled police personnel, used abusive language, and came onto Nelson Mandela Marg, leading to temporary obstruction of traffic,” the police said in a statement quoted by ANI.To prevent escalation, police detained 28 students — 19 men and 9 women — including JNUSU president Nitesh Kumar, vice president Manisha, and general secretary Muntia Fatima.During the incident, six police personnel — four men and two women — sustained injuries and were sent for medical examination. “Appropriate legal action is being initiated as per law,” the statement added.Students, however, alleged that the police used unnecessary force to disperse what they called a peaceful demonstration. Several JNU student groups criticised the detentions, and said that authorities were trying to suppress dissent on campus.The JNU is gearing up for its students' union elections, likely to be held in November.","At least 28 students of Jawaharlal Nehru University JNU, including student union (JNUSU) president Nitesh Kumar, were detained on Saturday evening after a protest outside the campus turned confrontational.

'Amit Shah Behaving Like Acting PM': Mamata Banerjee's 'Mir Jafar' Warning To PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that while infiltration has stopped in BJP-ruled Assam , it continues in neighbouring West Bengal, claiming that the state government is giving a ""red carpet welcome"" to illegal immigrants.Addressing a media conclave in Patna, Shah also mocked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for dropping the allegation of ""vote theft,"" and said the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls would remove ""infiltrators.""""It is baffling that the opposition has been getting a bellyache over an exercise launched by the Election Commission, which would weed out infiltrators. I am fully in support of the SIR exercise, which would eventually take place in the entire country,"" he said at the conclave, as reported by news agency PTI.When reminded that the opposition blamed the Centre for infiltration in the country, which has been in power at the Centre for 11 years, Shah said, ""People sitting in Lutyens Delhi have no idea of what the borders are like. The border with Bangladesh has dense forests and mighty rivers, which are in spate during the monsoons. Fencing is impossible, and so is round-the-clock vigil. Boats for security personnel manning the borders also tend to get washed away.""My point is, when a person from the neighbouring country enters our territory, can it not be known to the local police station and the patwari? Why do these officials not raise an alarm? Because they are under orders from above to give a red carpet ('lal jaajim') welcome to these infiltrators. This is the reason why infiltration is rampant in West Bengal but has been checked in Assam,"" he added.Shah urged people in West Bengal to vote out chief minister Mamata Banerjee in next year’s assembly elections and promised to ""drive out every infiltrator"" from the state.Claiming that Gandhi has dropped the ""vote chori"" charge, Shah said, ""on the very few occasions that he has been seen in public, he has never made the charge in the last 15 days. Perhaps the people of Bihar have made him give up on the charge. He must have been under advice based on some feedback.""The reference was to Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' in Bihar, which protested the SIR exercise, alleging it aimed to disenfranchise voters.Shah also rejected opposition claims that the 130th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which allows removal of ministers including the PM and CMs if jailed for 30 days or more, was meant to destabilise governments in non-BJP states.""I had stepped down when a case was pending against me in the court, and did not accept a post until I was acquitted. We have seen, in the recent past, governments being run by people behind bars. That cannot be allowed. Why is the opposition so scared? The Bill does not stipulate that a minister be removed as soon as his name comes up in an FIR,"" he said.","Union home minister Amit Shah says West Bengal is giving a ""red carpet welcome"" to illegal immigrants.

Their research led to ground-breaking discoveries about elementary particles - the fundamental building blocks of matter.Three years earlier, Yang, also known as Franklin or Frank, co-authored a set of equations with American physicist Robert Mills. The resulting Yang-Mills theory described how three of nature’s four fundamental forces — the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions — operate in the subatomic world.The Yang-Mills theory also laid the mathematical foundation for what came to be known as the Standard Model, which unifies these forces and explains the behaviour of all known elementary particles.In addition to his ground-breaking research, Yang was a prolific author, with numerous articles published in journals including the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Physical Review, Reviews of Modern Physics, and the Chinese Journal of Physics.","The eldest of five siblings, Yang, along with fellow theoretical physicist Lee- Tsung Dao, was jointly awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on parity laws.

And that is the approval of their far-left base,"" Thune said.House Speaker Mike Johnson has framed the ""No Kings"" protests as a series of ""Hate America"" rallies, stating, ""And I encourage you to watch -- we call it the ‘Hate America Rally’ that will happen Saturday. Let's see who shows up for that. I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see Antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display, the people who don't want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic.""Johnson did not provide any evidence to support his claims that “pro-Hamas supporters” and “Antifa types” will attend. Organisers have stated they cannot control who joins the protests from outside groups and have emphasised their intent to maintain respectful and nonviolent gatherings. In an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on Thursday, Trump dismissed being referred to as a ""king."" ""They're referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,"" he said.In advance of Saturday’s rallies, law enforcement is actively monitoring social media and the internet, as well as collaborating with local organisers and potential counter-protesters to anticipate events. This vigilance reflects ongoing concerns about large-scale public gatherings, especially political ones.Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced on X on Thursday that he ""directed the Dept of Public Safety and National Guard to surge forces into Austin"" ahead of the rallies. ""Texas will NOT tolerate chaos. Anyone destroying property or committing acts of violence will be swiftly arrested,” Abbott wrote. State Representative Gene Wu, chair of the state House’s Democratic caucus, responded, ""Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do -- and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them. ""Organisers have countered that Republicans in power are responsible for the ongoing shutdown and have noted that Johnson and some other Republicans’ reluctance to mention the protest’s name is significant.“I think it's really telling that he spent an entire week calling this a 'hate American Rally,' on the attack against this coalition and Americans across the country, and he won't even say the name of the protest,"" Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, one of the major groups in the ""No Kings"" coalition, told reporters on a press call on Thursday.Greenberg added, ""That's because if you say the name of the protest, 'No Kings,' the entire argument falls apart … there is nothing more American than saying that we don't have kings and exercising our right to peaceful protest.""When asked if they believed the Republican claims would impact participant turnout on Saturday, organisers responded that it might have the opposite effect. ""I think, if anything, it will increase turnout,"" said Schifeling. ""I think Americans can really see through these sad attempts to distract attention from the failure of these Republican Congress people and Republican Trump administration to actually address what most Americans want and need from their govt. ""Ezra Levin, co-executive director of Indivisible, told ABC News that he welcomes the publicity but believes Republicans are attempting to prevent Americans from exercising their First Amendment rights.""I think the Republicans and Trump see that the largest peaceful protest in modern American history is coming together on Saturday to push back against the authoritarian overreach by this regime and its supporters in Congress, and they're looking for ways to message against it ahead of time,"" he said.Celebrities including Jane Fonda, Kerry Washington, John Legend, Alan Cumming, and John Leguizamo are slated to attend, according to a fundraising email on Thursday from the political action committee Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""We'll be in the streets for immigrant families under attack and for voters who are being silenced.For communities being terrorised by militarised policing. For families who are about to lose their health insurance. And for every single person whose rights are threatened by this administration's cruelty,"" the group wrote in the email.The tension ahead of Saturday’s “No Kings” protests isn’t just political — it’s logistical. Several Republican leaders are already talking troop deployments.“We’ll have to get the National Guard out,” Sen. Roger Marshall warned this week. “Hopefully it’ll be peaceful. I doubt it.”Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has already sent his state’s National Guard to Austin, labeling the event “antifa-linked.” Democrats fired back, accusing him of acting like the very “king” protesters are rallying against.“Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do,” said Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu. “And Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them.”Organizers insist they’re ready. The Indivisible Project says it has trained tens of thousands in nonviolence and de-escalation, coordinating closely with cities that have National Guard units on alert. “We don’t expect a need for troops,” said ACLU’s Deirdre Schifeling, “but if the administration tries to use them to intimidate peaceful protesters, we’re prepared.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has planned ain California on the same day — a move critics see as a pointed countermessage.Experts warn the legal groundwork is already laid for a broader show of force. Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said the same memorandum used to send troops into Los Angeles could be invoked nationwide — even for peaceful protests. “It’s a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms,” she said.And while mobilizing troops takes planning, Goitein noted, “If we see them deployed this weekend, it means those orders were in motion long before anyone took to the streets.”For now, organizers say they’re focused on turnout — not troop counts — as millions prepare to march for democracy, not monarchy.","Organisers predict millions will hit the streets in over 2,600 events, spanning New York, D.C., Chicago, and LA. Law enforcement is actively monitoring social media and the internet, as well as collaborating with local organisers and potential counter-protesters to anticipate events.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124638607,imgsize-46486,width-400,resizemode-4/no-king-protest-ap-photo.jpg"

FULL: Trump’s Shocking U-turn On Tomahawks After Putin’s Call | Watch Big Russia Announcement





US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting came amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.“It’s an honour to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,” Trump said as he welcomed Zelenskyy. “We’ve gotten along really very well.” He added that his recent call with Putin had been “productive” and that he believed “something can get done” to bring peace between the two countries.Trump said both leaders Putin and Zelenskyy “don’t like each other,” calling the hostility “tremendous bad blood.” “These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everyone,” he said. “So one way or another, we’ll be involved in talks, but it might need to be in separate settings.”Asked about military aid, Trump expressed hesitation over supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is that it’s not easy for us to give massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said.“Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”He added, “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’re in it to get the war over. We’re not in it to sell weapons.” Trump’s comments came after Putin reportedly warned that supplying long-range missiles could escalate the conflict and make peace talks harder.The meeting, their third in the Oval Office and sixth this year, also included discussions on Ukraine’s proposal to store US liquefied natural gas in its facilities.Before the lunch, Trump briefly joked about Zelenskyy’s “very stylish jacket,” referring to their earlier tense February meeting where the two had clashed on live television.Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his Middle East ceasefire efforts and urged him to use that to help end the war in Ukraine. “With your support, we can stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Their army and economy are weakened, and this is a crucial moment.” He also noted that he had met with American energy and defence companies “ready to assist after the attacks on our infrastructure.”Trump, who has frequently described himself as a peacemaker, said, “I solved eight wars. I’ve saved millions and millions of lives.” Referring to India and Pakistan, he added, “That would have been a bad one. But we solved it.” He said he hoped to make Ukraine “number nine.”After meeting Zelenskyy, Trump took to Truth Social to call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. Trump said it is time to let each side “claim victory” and allow history to judge. He added that the war would never have started under his leadership and urged leaders to bring troops home so families can live in peace.He wrote: ""The meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was very interesting, and cordial, but I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide! No more shooting, no more Death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE, GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!""Speaking to journalists outside the White House after meeting President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think that Russia is afraid about Tomahawks, really afraid, because it’s a strong weapon.”","US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump ’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco. Joining him is now Tesla CEO Elon Musk who recently said that “This is the only solution at this point”. The tech billionaire was responding to a local advocate T Wolf's post citing a March 2025 survey where 61% of voters strongly support federal intervention to deport illegal fentanyl traffickers, rising to 83% including those who somewhat agree.The quoted post references SFPD's seizure of over 90 kilos of fentanyl in the past year and approximately 4,300 overdose deaths since 2020, aligning with official data showing 3,367 confirmed unintentional drug overdose fatalities from 2020 to 2024, with 2025 figures ongoing.“Pretty much 80% of San Francisco wants federal intervention on deporting drug dealers. That's how insane it's been here. 90+ kilos of fentanyl seized in one year by SFPD. 4,300 OD deaths since 2020. Hard data doesn't lie,” T Wolf wrote in the post. In another post, Wolf said “It's simple. If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away. If you don't, you reap what you sow.Replying to the post, Elon Musk wrote “It’s the only solution at this point. Nothing else has or will work.”In an interview last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he supports former President Donald Trump’s proposal to send federal troops to San Francisco, a plan that city leaders have called unacceptable.Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and backed the idea of deploying troops to help reduce crime. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted him as saying.Trump had reportedly discussed sending federal troops to San Francisco during an Oval Office meeting in August, naming it among several Democratic-led cities he said had been “destroyed.” He added that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff also praised Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative to cut federal spending and voiced support for venture capitalist David Sacks, who chairs Trump’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democrats strongly criticized Benioff’s remarks.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed that American forces struck and destroyed a “very large” drug-carrying submarine that was heading toward the United States. He said that at least 25,000 Americans would have died if the vessel had reached the shore.Trump also confirmed that the United States was sending two suspected drug traffickers back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia , after a military strike on their “drug-smuggling submarine” in the Caribbean that killed two others.The White House released a video of the strike, and also shared through Donald Trump’s Truth Social post.The footage clearly shows the attack on the vessel, with continuous fire as it moves through the water.Trump said, “It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route.” He added that the vessel was loaded with fentanyl and other drugs. “Two of the terrorists were killed. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution.”Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed that the Colombian suspect had been repatriated.“We are glad he is alive and he will be prosecuted according to the law,” Petro said on X.The strike was part of what Trump described as a military campaign to choke the flow of drugs from Latin America to the United States. Since September, at least six vessels, mostly speedboats, have been targeted by US strikes in the Caribbean, with Venezuela believed to be the origin of some of them.Washington has claimed that these strikes are delivering a decisive blow to drug traffickers, but it has not provided evidence that the 27 people killed so far were actually smugglers.Experts and rights groups have said that such summary strikes are illegal even if they target confirmed narcotics traffickers.The US has not revealed where the submarine departed from. Semi-submersible vessels built in secret jungle shipyards have long been used to carry cocaine from South America, mainly Colombia, to Central America or Mexico, often through the Pacific Ocean.","US President Donald Trump confirmed that American forces struck and destroyed a “very large’ drug-carrying submarine that was heading toward the United States.

Legal and social implications of lottery mismanagement





A man from Dezhou, Shandong province has captured the attention of social media and news outlets across China after winning a 10.17 million yuan (US$1.4 million) lottery in December 2024 and reportedly spending a large portion of his winnings on gambling and female live-streamers, leaving his wife with nothing. The scandal has sparked outrage online, drawn legal attention, and led to the wife filing for divorce, highlighting the ethical and social consequences of sudden wealth.The man, whose identity remains undisclosed, initially shared his winnings with his wife, surnamed Yuan, giving her a bank card alleged to contain 3 million yuan (US$420,000). Out of trust, Yuan did not check the account balance, keeping the card in a drawer. Soon after, the man’s behavior changed drastically: he stopped sharing money with his wife, spent his days gambling, and tipped female live-streamers millions of yuan, including a single tip of 1.2 million yuan (US$168,000).In July, he was discovered taking one live-streamer on a four-day trip, exposing the extent of his spending and personal involvement. Chat records obtained by Yuan revealed he addressed the streamer aswhile referring to himself asYuan later found the bank card had no funds, prompting her to file for divorce and publicly reveal the situation to Henan TV. Social media users have expressed widespread outrage, criticizing his irresponsible behavior and ethical misconduct.Under Chinese law, lottery winnings acquired during marriage are considered joint marital assets. According to lawyer Xi Junqi of Henan Zhongdi Law Firm, if tipping to live-streamers far exceeds normal family spending, the wife can petition the court to exclude him from sharing common assets. If the tipping is linked to an immoral relationship, she may also request the return of the money.The incident has sparked broader discussions online about the influence of sudden wealth on relationships, the ethics of excessive tipping in online streaming culture, and the responsibilities of lottery winners to their families. As the legal proceedings continue, the Dezhou man’s identity remains private, but the scandal serves as a cautionary tale for the consequences of reckless financial behavior.The Dezhou lottery scandal highlights how sudden financial windfalls can disrupt personal relationships and attract public scrutiny. While the man’s identity remains unknown, his actions, lavishing millions on live-streamers while neglecting his marital obligations, have made him the focus of national attention, legal debate, and social media outrage, illustrating the ethical responsibilities that come with significant wealth.","A man from Dezhou, Shandong province won a 10.17 million yuan (US$1.4 million) lottery in December 2024.

Florida councilman Chandler Langevin who created a ripple by his targeted attack on Indians in the US was censured in a 3-2 vote by the Palm Bay council as the council took note of his offensive comments on the Indian community. Langevin had deleted one of the controversial posts but defended all and refused to apologize . After being censured by his council, he said he would sue the council.A censure in the council means Langevin will be able to place an item on the agenda if he gets consensus from the council beforehand.

Who is George Santos?





US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he has commuted the prison sentence of ex-congressman George Santos, who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.“I just signed a commutation releasing George Santos from prison, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “George Santos was somewhat of a rogue, but there are many rogues throughout our country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” he added.Santos, a Republican from New York, admitted last year that he deceived donors and stole the identities of 11 people — including members of his own family — to make fraudulent campaign donations. He began serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, on July 25, and had been housed in a minimum-security camp with fewer than 50 inmates.Following the announcement, Andrew Mancilla, one of Santos’s attorneys, welcomed the decision, calling it “the right thing to do.”""Very, very happy with the decision. The defence team applauds President Trump for doing the right thing.The sentence was far too long,"" Mancilla told The Associated Press.However, the timing of the 37-year-old's release remains unclear.The move comes just days after Santos sent a handwritten letter from prison appealing directly to Trump for clemency. “Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he wrote. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community. ”The son of Brazilian immigrants, Santos made history in 2022 as the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Trump mocks movement





Large crowds of protesters gathered across all 50 states of the US on Saturday against President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched into its third week amid a legislative deadlock.While the protesters called the demonstration the “No Kings” movement, Republicans ridiculed it as “Hate America” rallies.Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states including Washington, Los Angeles, Montana, and several other places.More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states — from major cities such as Washington D.C. and New York to small towns across the Midwest.In San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she had never attended a protest before. Only recently, she began to view Trump as a “dictator.”“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands in Washington near the US Capitol, where the federal government remained shut for a third week amid a legislative deadlock.Demonstrators slammed what they called the Republican billionaire’s strong-arm tactics, including attacks on the media, political opponents, and undocumented immigrants.It was the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only closed federal programs and services but also tested the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces and National Guard troops into US cities — viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities — sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies leading to deportations and alleged injustices, and the government shutdown’s impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Meanwhile, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before departing for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.Trump’s campaign social media account also mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president dressed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.Republican leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”","More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states.

Marc Benioff apologised on Friday for saying President Donald Trump should send the National Guard to San Francisco after a week of being hammered by the city’s leaders and even some of his fellow tech titans for the remarks.“I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff, the Salesforce founder and CEO, posted on the social platform X.

US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in to defend US defence secretary Pete Hegseth after social media was grilling him over the colour of his tie during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The row began when photos from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting at the White House showed Hegseth wearing a tie in white, blue, and red — colours that some claimed resembled the Russian tricolour flag.The photos went viral, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Special Envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, sharing Hegseth’s photo on social media alongside a Russian flag emoji, adding fuel to the fire.Vance responded to the continuous trolling on social media, slamming critics who were reading too much into the tie’s design. “Or maybe he was wearing the colors of America,” he said on X, reposting commentary from American YouTuber and former US Army officer Jake Broe, who was among the first ones to share the viral image and claiming that ""these people love Putin and Russia.""Despite Vance’s defence, most netizens remained unconvinced. Commenters argued that if the tie truly represented the American flag, it should have included stars or a different pattern.Some users even dug up an online listing for what appeared to be the same tie, described in the product details as a “Russian plain flag tie,” adding to the speculation.The photo was captured during Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on Thursday, when he met US President Donald Trump for talks that included a public briefing and a private lunch. Trump later said he intended to work with Ukraine to persuade Putin to end the war, but confirmed that Kyiv would not receive Tomahawk missiles.Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said Russia had launched drone and missile attacks on energy and transport infrastructure ahead of winter, targeting power stations, substations, and railway lines.",US Vice President JD Vance responds to criticism of Pete Hegseth's tie.

As US President Donald Trump marked a military parade in Washington, DC, this June, around 5 million people across the country protested his administration. Now, amid an ongoing government shutdown and Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops to cities, millions are preparing for a second wave of demonstrations.Over 2,500 rallies are planned across all 50 states this Saturday, around 450 more than in June. Organizers say the “No Kings” protests aim to oppose what they call Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda. Some Republican leaders have labelled the protests anti-American.Here are 10 of the best posters from “No Kings” protests, using wordplay and creativity to show opposition to authoritarianism, corruption, and threats to civil liberties.The first round of protests followed hundreds of Trump’s executive orders targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, diversity initiatives, and more. Tensions over immigration reached a peak when Trump federalized the California National Guard against Governor Gavin Newsom’s wishes. ICE raids, media clashes, and attempts to deploy federal troops in Democratic-led cities have further stoked opposition.Some Republicans have called the protests “Hate America” rallies, warning of agitators and Antifa involvement. Organizers stress that the demonstrations will be peaceful. Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, said, “What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights.”The administration is expected to hold a military show of force in California on the same day. Meanwhile, Department of Homeland Security has issued guidelines to law enforcement to monitor for potential violence and ensure protests remain safe.","Over 2,500 rallies are planned across all 50 states this Saturday, around 450 more than in June.

Bernie Sanders SHAKES White House With Roaring Speech Against ""Authoritarian"" Trump | NO KINGS Rally





Millions of Americans gathered at more than 2500 demonstrations across a deeply polarized United States in what protestors characterised as a ""No Kings"" movement and what the ruling MAGA dispensation called “Hate America rallies. ”The mass mobilisation, the second one since President Donald Trump took office in January, echoed the anti-monarchist spirit of the American Revolution as protestors gathered in parks and street corners chanting slogans against what they believe has turned into an unfettered imperial presidency.The protests reject the idea of a supreme, unchecked ruler that they believe Trump had become and oppose what they see as the President acting like a monarch who defies constitutional limits, the courts, and democratic norms.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces/National Guard troops into US cities, viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities; sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies, leading to deportations and alleged injustices; and the government shutdown and its impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Typical signs at the protests included “No Faux-King Way!” “Fight Truth Decay” and “I could shit a better president.” Many immigrants, even citizens, stayed away fearing adverse scrutiny.President Trump has rejected the charge that he is acting like a monarch, remarking on one occasion, ""I don't feel like a king, I have to go through hell to get stuff approved."" He frames the presidency as a difficult job constrained by a “deep state, ” a Democrats-dominated bureaucracy, and a “radical left opposition” that have combined to diminish mostly-white and caucasian American exceptionalism.Leading up to the protests, Trump surrogates sought to delegitimize them, calling them unpatriotic ""hate America rallies"" by “subversive” “radical left” demonstrators they describe as “antifa.” In a Fox News interview, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt suggested the rallies were events staged and backed by the Democratic Party, and alleged its “main constituency is made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals. ”Visually, the rallies were anything but that, featuring mainly white native-born Americans. Fearing that the protests would be infiltrated by right-wing provocateurs, rally organizers in many places asked demonstrators to maintain peace and to personalize their concerns about domestic issues like health care and government shutdown, while keeping out symbols like Palestinian flags, support for Ukraine etc, and not carrying anything weapons.Indeed, the best weapons were words in the form of biting, cutting slogans. “Not a paid protestor. I hate Trump for free,” read one poster, alluding to the MAGA charge that the demonstrations were funded by anti-America forces. “The only tyrant I accept is my child!” read another held by a woman pushing an infant in a stroller.A man in a chicken suit held up a poster that simply read: CLUCK TRUMP !","Millions of Americans gathered at more than 2500 demonstrations across a deeply polarized United States.

What's next







US President Donald Trump has escalated his campaign against left-leaning philanthropist George Soros, directing federal agencies to investigate what he called “left-wing terrorism” and “political violence” across the United States. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Treasury Department is preparing to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) criminal investigative division to target major Democratic donors including Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF).The move is reportedly being spearheaded by Gary Shapley, a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been tasked with replacing top IRS officials and focusing on “financial networks” linked to political unrest. “We are operationalising this here at Treasury,” Bessent said in a recent interview, confirming that work had begun on compiling lists of groups and individuals for review.The Washington Post earlier reported that Trump has privately urged the Justice Department to consider bringing racketeering charges against Soros and his son Alex under the federal RICO statute typically used to combat organised crime. The memo cited a report from the conservative Capital Research Center, which accused Soros-funded organisations of backing groups linked to violent protests, including the Sunrise Movement.The Open Society Foundations, founded by Soros and now run by his son Alex, has dismissed Trump’s claims as “outrageous and false.” In a statement shared with Forbes, the organisation said: “Our work is dedicated to strengthening democracy and upholding constitutional freedoms.” A spokesperson added that OSF would “continue to operate within the bounds of the law” and would not “surrender its constitutional rights to free speech or due process. ”According to The Washington Post, lawyers for OSF are already preparing briefs in anticipation of an IRS inquiry, while progressive groups have begun warning Capitol Hill that the administration could use financial probes to pressure banks into freezing the accounts of prominent Democratic donors. “These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with,” OSF said in another statement.Trump, however, remains defiant. In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: “George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of violent protests and much more. We’re not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more.”While US law prohibits the president or senior administration officials from ordering IRS audits or investigations into specific individuals, Trump’s broader strategy involves empowering federal agencies including the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Treasury Department to “identify and disrupt” funding networks that he claims support political violence. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the Stop Funders Act, which would authorise the Justice Department to prosecute non-profits accused of supporting violent demonstrations.The campaign against Soros marks a significant escalation in Trump’s long-standing feud with the billionaire, who has been a frequent target of right-wing conspiracy theories.",US President Donald Trump has escalated his campaign against left-leaning philanthropist George Soros.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment. ""Core issues should be settled with Pakistan as per international norms, on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses to be inflicted will be beyond the imagination and calculations of those responsible for chaos and instability,"" the jihadi army chief said.Munir went on to claim that decisive responses will be made to even minor provocations and that the onus of ensuing escalations, which may bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region, will lie with India,"" he added.Referring to India and Afghanistan, with whom it is currently engaged in hostility, Munir said that the use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij (a reference to rebel groups like the BLA and TTP) as hired guns exposes its 'hypocritical and heinous' face to the world. ""Afghan Taliban regime should rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” Munir added.Claiming the minerals and rare earth deposits in Balochistan would change Pakistan's future, he said, ""The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future.""","Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

Three senior ministers in the cabinet of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq resigned on Saturday.The ministers accused the prime minister of failing to protect the constitutional and political rights of PoJK residents and Kashmiri refugees living in Pakistan, news agency ANI reported.According to The Express Tribune, information minister Pir Mazhar Saeed had already stepped down earlier. Later, finance minister Abdul Majid Khan, food minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim and minister Asim Sharif Bhat also announced their resignations.In their statements, the ministers alleged that Haq had lost moral and political legitimacy, neglecting both the people of PoJK and the 2.5 million Kashmiri refugees residing across Pakistan.They demanded his resignation and criticised the government’s handling of recent unrest, saying it had failed to represent refugee interests in the legislative structure.In his resignation letter, Abdul Majid Khan reaffirmed his loyalty to Pakistan’s ideology and the rights of Kashmiri refugees. He strongly criticised the Jammu and Kashmir Joint Action Committee (JAAC) for pushing what he called a “divisive and opportunistic” demand to abolish 12 reserved refugee seats in the PoJK Legislative Assembly.He said the agreement reached between the JAAC and federal representatives lacked legitimacy and broader consensus.Echoing his remarks, Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim said refugees were not “mere political numbers,” but patriotic Pakistanis who had endured decades of displacement.He accused the Haq government of failing to uphold their constitutional rights, saying it had become “impossible to continue serving under such leadership,” ANI reported citing The Express Tribune.Both ministers have written to President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief General Asim Munir, urging them to intervene.They warned that millions of divided Kashmiris across Pakistan feel increasingly alienated and are demanding the restoration of their rightful representation within PoJK’s political framework.",Three senior ministers in the cabinet of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq resigned on Saturday.
