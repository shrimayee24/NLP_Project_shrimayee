Poll Should India continue purchasing oil from Russia despite US tariffs? Yes, for national interest No, avoid conflict

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which is to take place in New York City.According to the provisional list of speakers for the high-level debate of the 80th session of the General Assembly, India’s “Head of Government (HG)” will address the session on the morning of September 26, reported news agency PTI.The Heads of Government of Israel, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are also scheduled to address the UNGA general debate on the same day. PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska."" ""Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Putin’s trip to Alaska will be his first to the US in a decade.

Claressa Shields and Remy Ma feud fueled by viral video confusion

“Claressa Shields says she beat up Remy Ma.”

Remy Ma and Claressa Shields drama tied to affair claims and divorce battle

Claressa Shields did not fight Remy Ma. That’s the truth, though a video made people think otherwise. This happened on August 13, 2025, when a clip of Shields saying she “ran up on her” was shared online. Many thought she meant Remy Ma, but sources say she was talking about boxer Alycia Baumgardner from a 2024 clip. Remy Ma never had any fight with Claressa and she actually said she wishes that they had.On August 14, 2025, TMZ Sports reported that Claressa Shields, the 17-0 boxing champion, never went after Remy Ma. A video, edited to confuse viewers, made it look like Shields was talking about the rapper. The soundbite did spark guesses, even DJ Akademiks captioned itBut people close to Remy Ma confirmed the fighter was actually talking about Alycia Baumgardner in a video from the previous year. Remy Ma never had any confrontation with her in person.Still, the singer said she would have welcomed the chance. That means if Claressa had shown up fully looking for a fight, Remy Ma said she’d be ready. It says a lot about her confidence.The bigger story started last year. Remy Ma, best known for her song “Feels So Good,” accused her estranged husband Papoose of cheating with Claressa Shields.Then, Remy shared private messages that hinted at drama.Also Read: “So Plan B Was Okay”: Maria Sharapova Emotionally Opens Up About Life Lessons From Father Yuri Sharapov In these exchanges, Claressa told Papoose to take accountability, adding more fuel to a messy situation.

Yet the internet buzz carried on. As it is wisely said, “Can’t believe everything written online.”","Claressa Shields did not fight Remy Ma, though a video made people think otherwise.

Martina Navratilova on moving to the U.S. under Trump’s rule

“kissing the ring.”

Martina Navratilova, the famous former tennis player, spoke up on August 14, 2025, on her X account. She shared how upset she was with President Donald J. Trump. Trump had taken over the Washington, D.C. , police force and brought in 800 National Guard troops, saying the move was needed to fight rising violent crime in the city. But crime was actually at a low. Navratilova shared a Rolling Stone report and wrote plainly: “He would love nothing more than an excuse to open fire on protesters.” She once said, calling out Trump’s policy,One of the all-time greats, Martina Navratilova, renounced her former nation and is now a United States citizen. She achieved 18 Grand Slams overall and won her first at Wimbledon in 1978 against Chris Evert.Under Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, President Trump signed an executive order on August 11, 2025. He said violent crime was surging and took temporary control of the Metropolitan Police Department. He also sent in 800 National Guard soldiers to the capital.But news outlets like PolitiFact and local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, said crime had actually gone down since 2023.Studies found violent crime dropped by about 26–35 per cent in recent years.In response, many residents took to the streets. They called the military move harsh and anti-democratic. Against this backdrop, Navratilova’s warning rang out: she said Trump looked for any excuse to silence or harm protesters. Her words echoed the concern many felt.Also Read: “More than any American Culture”: Martina Navratilova once shared how Chris Evert’s Catholic upbringing shaped her tennis image Martina Navratilova, who moved to America in 1981, also spoke recently about immigration.

"Army Doctor, who treated lakhs of tribals for sickle cell anaemia, to attend President's 'At Home Reception'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/army-doctor-who-treated-lakhs-of-tribals-for-sickle-cell-anaemia-to-attend-presidents-at-home-reception/articleshow/123316844.cms,"PUNE: The deaths of two girls, aged 10 and 12, from sickle cell anaemia at the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) clinic in 2023 deeply disturbed Colonel Dr Y Uday, as he couldn't save them.Upon investigation, Dr Uday discovered that the girls were from a remote village, Shahada, in Nandurbar district, over 500 kilometres from Pune. They came to a govt hospital in Pune when their conditions were worse due to a lack of appropriate treatment in their home district.This troubling revelation prompted Colonel Uday to take action. Guided by the motto of the Armed Forces Medical Services, ""Sarve Santu Niramaya"" (Let all be free from disease and disability), he went to the village with six final-year MBBS students and four postgraduate students from AFMC.He first conducted health check-ups for over 150 tribals aged 6 to 15 and found that their health conditions made them genetically prone to the disease. This drive gave him a glimpse of the severity of the issue.Given the alarming situation in the village, AFMC approached the Nandurbar district administration to carry out extensive medical screenings in tribal villages across remote tehsils.To facilitate this large-scale initiative, AFMC established a satellite centre equipped with advanced testing kits and machines with Col Uday to lead the operations.After receiving approval from the district administration, Dr Uday and his team launched their ""mission"" in the district.""As part of the mission, 346,107 individuals from the district were screened for sickle cell disorder. Of these, on-site confirmatory testing via capillary zone electrophoresis was conducted for 161,400 tribals, including 130,483 students from 646 schools and colleges, and 19,082 door-to-door tests were conducted across 284 villages,"" Dr Uday told TOI. Additionally, 9,399 patients were screened at healthcare facilities, including primary health centres, rural hospitals, and district hospitals, along with 2,436 pregnant women, he said.Alongside sickle cell screening, the outreach programme also screened 151,000 tribal individuals for anaemia as part of the 'Anaemia Mukt Bharat' initiative. As part of the Tribal Health Initiative, non-communicable disease screenings were conducted, with 8,527 tribals screened for multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer), 8,464 for diabetes through HbA1C testing, and 10,024 for thyroid dysfunction, said AFMC doctors.As a long-term measure, Dr Uday developed an indigenously built hybrid application, ‘care4sickle.in’, for monitoring sickle cell disease, providing marriage counselling, and ensuring long-term follow-up for patients. Lauding Dr Uday and AFMC's efforts, the then-collector of Nandurbar district, Manisha Khatri, told TOI, ""Had the AFMC and Dr Uday not stepped in, we would not have recognised the severity of the issue. """"We have prepared a comprehensive health report on the disease and submitted it to the state govt. The report includes several short and long-term measures that will be implemented over the years to mitigate the disease. Long-term strategies need to be developed on the ground to break the genetic transmission of the disease in the district.""On August 2, Dr Uday received an official invitation from the President's office to attend the 'At Home Reception' at Rashtrapati Bhavan Cultural Centre on the occasion of Independence Day. He, along with three other distinguished doctors from the country, will attend the function.""It is a great honour to receive an invitation from the supreme commander of the armed forces. This recognition is a result of the sincere efforts and hard work of my students and the support of my seniors,"" said Dr Uday, who now heads the Department of Medical Research at AFMC.""We are determined to take this mission to the next stage, and our work continues. This recognition will certainly boost our morale to care for the people in the remote corners of the country,"" he added.","The deaths of two girls, aged 10 and 12, from sickle cell anaemia deeply disturbed Colonel Dr Y Uday, as he couldn't save them.

Serbia protest: Anti-government unrest escalates for third night of clashes — see video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/serbia-protest-anti-government-unrest-escalates-for-third-night-of-clashes-see-video/articleshow/123315522.cms,"



At least 42 police officers, including 26 in Belgrade, were injured after a Clash erupted between rival groups of protesters in Serbia, as months of anti-governmental demonstrations boiled over into street violence for a second night, Tass news agency reported.A wave of anti-corruption protests has gripped Serbia since November, following the collapse of the Novi Sad railway station roof that killed 16 people, a tragedy widely blamed on entrenched corruption.Protesters gathered again in several cities across Serbia late on Wednesday, mainly in response to an attack by ruling party supporters on demonstrators in the town of Vrbas, about 160 km north of the capital, Belgrade. For the second night running, large groups of pro-government supporters, most wearing masks, confronted protesters.The two groups hurled bottles, stones and fireworks at each other. Police arrested nearly 50 people across the country. The worst violence was reported in parts of Belgrade and Novi Sad, where the protest movement first began. One man, later identified as a military police officer, fired a pistol into the air as protesters approached the ruling party’s offices in Novi Sad, causing panic, as per Guardian.Footage also appeared to show supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party launching fireworks at protesters gathered outside the party’s headquarters there. Police intervened with teargas, and stun grenades could also be heard.Frustrated with government inaction, protesters demanded an investigation into the Novi Sad tragedy and piled pressure on the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vucic, to call early elections. Over the past nine months, thousands of mostly peaceful, student-led demonstrations have been held, some attracting hundreds of thousands.This week’s violence, however, marked a significant escalation and indicated the increasing strain on Vucic’s populist government, in power for 13 years. Since June 28, when about 140,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade, the government has responded with an “intensifying crackdown” on activists, according to a statement by UN human rights experts released earlier this month.Protesters and those linked to the movement had faced a “troubling pattern of repression” including excessive police force, intimidation and arbitrary arrest, the experts said. Vucic has remained defiant, repeatedly rejecting calls for early elections and denouncing the demonstrations as part of a foreign plot to overthrow him.After the Novi Sad shooting incident, officials confirmed the man was a member of a special military police unit usually tasked with protecting government ministers, Guardian reported.He had fired his weapon while “on a routine assignment when attacked by about 100 people”, officials said. The officer told journalists on Thursday: “I used my firearm and fired a shot into the air in a safe direction.At that moment, the attackers scattered.” Footage widely shared online showed a man wearing a black T-shirt and no clear military insignia pointing a pistol into the air near protesters. Military officials said that seven members of the same military police unit had been injured while on duty to “protect a specific person”, but gave no further details.Student protesters accused the police of protecting pro-government supporters while doing little to stop the attacks on their own gatherings. “The authorities tried to provoke a civil war last night,” the students wrote on their official Instagram page.They announced further protests for Thursday night. Vucic, who visited pro-government encampments overnight, denied his supporters had started the violence. “No one attacked them anywhere,” he said of the anti-government protesters, speaking at a late-night press conference.“They went everywhere to attack those who think differently.” While the protests have so far led to the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of his cabinet, Vucic remains at the helm of a reshuffled government.","Protesters gathered again in several cities across Serbia late on Wednesday, mainly in response to an attack by ruling party supporters on demonstrators in the town of Vrbas.

Trump's crackdown on crime in Washington: DEA head appointed as ‘emergency police commissioner'; granted full powers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-crackdown-on-crime-in-washington-dea-head-appointed-as-emergency-police-commissioner-granted-full-powers/articleshow/123315025.cms,"



US Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as Washington’s “emergency police commissioner,” granting him the powers of the police chief amid the federal takeover.On Thursday, Bondi , in a directive notice, said that Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.”She added that the Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, AP reported.The Attorney General has rescinded a directive issued by Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, that required MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies concerning individuals not in custody, such as those involved in traffic stops or checkpoints.Bondi stated that she was revoking that order along with other MPD policies that limited inquiries into immigration status and prevented arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.""All new directives must now receive approval from Cole,"" the Attorney General said.The late-night announcement followed an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively aligned Trump's initiatives on city law enforcement with his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had commended it in the hours preceding Bondi's declaration.“That’s a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith’s order. “That’s a great step. That’s a great step if they’re doing that.”The police chief increased cooperation between her officers and federal immigration officials as President Donald Trump’s law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital took root Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took up position in front of the busy main train station.The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members activated by Trump begin missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.“They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation’s capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said.“The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”","US Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as Washington’s “emergency police commissioner,” granting him the powers of the police chief.

A Hindu temple in the United States has been vandalised, prompting condemnation from the Indian Consulate in Chicago. In a post on X, the consulate described the desecration of the main signboard of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Greenwood, Indiana, as “reprehensible” and confirmed it had raised the matter with law enforcement for prompt action. The Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against “miscreants”.The incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills, California. At the time, ministry of external affairs condemned the act “in the strongest terms” and urged local authorities to act swiftly and ensure security at places of worship. BAPS Public Affairs said the Hindu community would “stand steadfast against hate” and “never let hate take root”.The Coalition of Hindus of North America also linked such incidents to rising hostility towards Hindus, noting the timing ahead of a planned “Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles. Previous attacks on BAPS temples were reported in Sacramento and New York last year, fuelling concerns over repeated targeting of Hindu places of worship across the US.","Vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Indiana described as'reprehensible' Indian Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against'miscreants' Incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminrayan Mandir in California.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123275239,imgsize-985007,width-400,resizemode-4/123275239.jpg"

'Treated like a criminal': New Zealand woman and 6-year-old son detained by ICE at US border; narrates 'terrifying' ordeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/treated-like-a-criminal-new-zealand-woman-and-6-year-old-son-detained-by-ice-at-us-border-narrates-terrifying-ordeal/articleshow/123274510.cms,"Image: GoFundMe@/VictoriaBesancon





A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.","Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand.

'We have Tony Soparno': George Conway compares Trump to fictional character; remarks made over federal takeover of DC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-have-tony-soparno-george-conway-compares-trump-to-fictional-character-remarks-made-over-federal-takeover-of-dc/articleshow/123313276.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image) and George Conway (Image: X/@C_3C_3)





George Conway, a conservative and prominent critic of President Donald Trump , has compared the Republican leader to Tony Soprano, the fictional mob boss from the TV series The Sopranos. The comment came in response to Trump’s federal takeover of Washington DC.Conway and former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor appeared on MSNBC Wednesday to discuss Trump placing the DC police under federal control and deploying the National Guard. Trump said the move was in response to “out of control” crime, although data shows violent crime in DC has been declining since its peak in 2023, as reported by the Independent.Conway, who was once married to Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway, said, “We don’t have Ronald Reagan anymore. We have Tony Soprano. He’s holding people up, threatening them, bullying them, doing things beyond his legal authority. And that scares people.”He added that Trump intimidates those he sees as opponents. “We see the intimidation of people who have had the courage, like Miles [Taylor], to speak out and criticize the president,” Conway said. “There is no limit to how low he will go, and what he will do to intimidate and to threaten and to assert power over things.”Taylor, who served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security under Trump’s first term, wrote an anonymous 2018 op-ed titled “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.”In it, he said many Trump appointees aimed to protect democratic institutions while preventing Trump’s “more misguided impulses.”In April, Trump had signed an executive order targeting Taylor, revoking his security clearance and instructing the Justice Department to investigate him. His attorneys also sent letters to the justice department and Homeland Security inspectors general, requesting an investigation.Taylor described the experience as deeply disruptive.“This has not been made easy, because once you are on the president's blacklist, all sorts of things in your life start to implode, businesses, relationships, friendships, financial, you have an army of lawyers,” he told MSNBC.Conway also expressed concern about federal involvement in local law enforcement across the country. Trump indicated Wednesday that the DC move could serve as a model for cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.“I also think it's important that people understand why it is that this kind of federal overreach is bad, and it's bad because it consolidates power in a federal government. And as Americans, we have never, never wanted that to happen,” Conway said. “We've always had a federal system where local authorities handle local things like crime and safety on the streets, public safety.”He added that such federal involvement could lead to abuse since there would be limited checks.Trump has also suggested extending the federal takeover of DC police beyond the 30-day limit, which would require Congressional approval.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Senator Elizabeth Warren “has got to take a drug test” in response to her claims that he is trying to cut Social Security.Trump made the remarks during a White House event marking the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, where he pledged to strengthen the program “for generations to come.”""It's so vicious what they do. Elizabeth Warren said she was an Indian. We call her Pocahontas. She's a liar. She lied her whole career,"" Trump said. ""Based on the fact that she was an Indian, she was able to get into certain colleges, get certain jobs, get into certain universities to work there. And she's a liar and a mean person.""Trump also criticized Warren for supporting Democratic Socialist New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani . ""She's a nutjob. I watched her the other night. She's all hopped up endorsing a communist in New York City, and she was all excited and jumping up and down. She's got to take a drug test. She really, though, she's got to take a drug test. There's no way somebody can act that way and be normal.”Earlier this year, Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote an op-ed for Fox News claiming that Social Security is under unprecedented attack under the Trump administration. She criticized billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Elon Musk , alleging attempts to weaken the program by firing workers, closing offices and cutting services, as reported by Fox News.Warren said that Social Security services should not be cut or Americans’ benefits threatened. She added that people are struggling with high prices while their retirement savings shrink. She called for a temporary increase in benefits to provide relief and suggested lifting the cap on contributions from millionaires and billionaires to secure the system long-term and fund permanent benefit expansion.Trump defended his administration’s approach, saying, “We've already kicked nearly 275,000 illegal aliens off of the Social Security system.""The US President said that many of these people have already left the country, yet they were still receiving Social Security checks. He added that removing them strengthens the system and contrasted with former President Joe Biden , who he claimed did not remove anyone and allowed everyone to stay on.","Trump made the remarks during a White House event marking the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act.

Free speech clash: Supreme Court allows Mississippi's law requiring age verification for minors; tech giants oppose mandate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/free-speech-clash-supreme-court-allows-mississippis-law-requiring-age-verification-for-minors-tech-giants-oppose-mandate/articleshow/123312681.cms,"US Supreme Court (AP image)





The US Supreme Court on Thursday declined to temporarily block a Mississippi law that requires age verification and parental consent for minors to use social media platforms.The law, aimed at protecting young people from potential online harm, will remain in effect while legal challenges continue. It is one of several measures passed by US states to curb the influence of social media on children.NetChoice – a group representing companies including Facebook, Instagram , Reddit, X and YouTube had asked the Supreme Court to halt the law after the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed its enforcement. A lower court had earlier blocked the law, ruling it likely violated the First Amendment.US District Judge Sul Ozerden said the measure was overly broad and that parents already have other ways to monitor their children’s online activity.The Supreme Court did not explain its decision. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that while the law may be unconstitutional, NetChoice had not proven that enforcing it during the court battle would cause enough harm to justify halting it, USA Today reported.NetChoice attorney Paul Taske called the ruling a “procedural delay” and expressed confidence the group would ultimately prevail in protecting free speech rights.“Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment − not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,"" Taske said in a statement.Mississippi officials defended the law, saying it targets platforms that allow predators to contact minors. They cited a case in which a 16-year-old boy took his own life after he met someone on Instagram who threatened to expose their sexual encounter unless he paid $1,000.The state also argued that blocking the law conflicted with the Supreme Court’s earlier decision to uphold a Texas law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.NetChoice maintains the law infringes on free speech by forcing all user, including adults to provide personal information to access online platforms.""Social media is the modern printing press − it allows all Americans to share their thoughts and perspectives,” Taske said. “Just as the government can’t force you to provide identification to read a newspaper, the same holds true when that news is available online.”","Mississippi law requires age verification and parental consent for minors to use social media platforms.

US President Donald Trump again claimed he brokered peace between India and Pakistan when the countries were probably going ""nuclear"".

President Donald Trump called Norway's finance minister Jens Stoltenberg last month to discuss trade tariffs, POLITICO reported, citing Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv and called it a ""cold call"" to ask about his bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Several countries, including Israel, Pakistan and Cambodia, have already nominated Trump for brokering peace as Trump claimed he facilitated peace between many countries since his inauguration in January. Trump also hosted Armenia and Azerbaijan as the two countries ended their hostilities.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) in March said he would nominate Trump for the award, and Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) nominated him in June, citing his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel.Trump's August 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin is another step towards his attempts to broker peace. While critics are questioning why Putin is being welcomed to Alaska, Trump is hopeful to coerce Putin into an agreement to stop the Ukraine war, as he emphasized that he would understand in the first few minutes of the negotiation talk where it's headed.Trump said a second meeting may follow, where the peace deal could be worked out after the stage is set at the Alaska summit.“It is true that President Trump called me a few days before his conversation with Prime Minister Støre. Several of the president’s staff members also participated in the conversation, including Treasury Secretary Bessent and Trade Representative Greer,” Stoltenberg, the former NATO secretary-general, told POLITICO in a comment.“We discussed tariffs, economic cooperation, and it served as preparation for his call with Prime Minister Støre. I will not go into further detail about the content of the conversation,” he added.The MAGA has been aiming for a Nobel for Trump and if he gets, he would become the 5th US president to receive the prize, following Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Trump’s longtime rival Barack Obama.Trump laid his heart bare on how much he wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize but he believed that they won't give it to him. “It’s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me,"" he said.The award is given annually in December by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to someone who has worked to establish peace between nations.","President Donald Trump called Norway's finance minister Jens Stoltenberg last month to discuss trade tariffs, reports claimed.

A US department of justice employee has been fired on Thursday after allegedly assaulting a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent with a Subway sandwich in Washington DC.The suspect, identified as Sean Charles Dunn, 37, worked in the DOJ’s criminal division in the international affairs section, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi, as reported by CNBC News.“I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER,” Bondi wrote on X.The incident took place Sunday night in the city’s Northwest section. A video on X was posted by FBI Director Kash Patel shows a man in a pink polo shirt and light shorts holding a wrapped sandwich while speaking to a small group of federal agents.The footage then shows the man hurling the sandwich into the chest of a nearby CBP officer before running away, with several officers giving chase.According to a police statement, Dunn was apprehended after attempting to flee. While in custody, he allegedly admitted to the act, saying: “I did it. I threw a sandwich.”Dunn has been charged with felony federal assault. Prosecutors say the altercation began after he shouted at a group of federal officers, calling them “fascists,” before throwing the sandwich, as reported by New York Post.“Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!” Dunn shouted, according to police.Dunn was arrested on Wednesday night, Patel said.The incident occurred amid heightened federal law enforcement activity in the capital. President Donald Trump ordered additional federal officers to support local police on August 7 and later asserted federal control over the DC Metropolitan Police Department, deploying the National Guard.","Sean Charles Dunn, 37, worked in the DOJ’s criminal division in the international affairs section.

‘100% I’ll get him out’: Trump vows to free jailed Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai; Beijing warns against foreign interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/100-ill-get-him-out-trump-vows-to-free-jailed-hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-beijing-warns-against-foreign-interference/articleshow/123310588.cms,"Jimmy Lai (Image: X/@hkdc_us)





Days before winning second presidential elections, Donald Trump vowed to secure the release of 77-year-old jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai Lai is the outspoken founder of the now-closed Apple Daily which is a strong pro-democratic newspaper known for its sharp criticism of China’s Communist Party which was later forced to shut down, as reported by CNN.He had spent more than 1600 days in a maximum-security prison, much of it in solitary confinement. Lai is accused of working with foreign forces, a crime under Beijing’s 2020 national security law that can lead to life in prison and a separate sedition charge. He has not pleaded guilty to all charges.On Thursday, a Hong Kong court was set to begin closing arguments, but proceedings were delayed due to severe weather. The hearings, expected to span several days, will pave the way for a verdict that could test Trump’s ability and willingness to deliver on his October 2024 campaign promise to “100%” secure Lai’s release.Trump has indicated he would raise Lai’s case directly with Chinese leader Xi Jinping , potentially linking it to ongoing US–China trade negotiations. Lai’s aides and supporters say the case has been mentioned informally during recent trade talks. White House officials under Trump have reiterated that securing Lai’s release remains a goal.In an October interview, Trump told podcast host Hugh Hewitt that he would “100%” speak to Xi Jinping to secure Lai’s release if he won the election.Later, as president, Trump vowed to bring up Lai’s case during US trade negotiations with China. “100% I’ll get him out. He’ll be easy to get out,” he said“I think talking about Jimmy Lai is a very good idea,” he told Hewitt in a subsequent radio interview in May, just days before officials met in Geneva for the first round of talks. “We’ll put it down, and we’ll put it down as part of the negotiation.”Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have condemned foreign involvement in the case, calling it interference in China’s internal affairs. Chinese officials have rejected suggestions that the legal proceedings are politically motivated.“Any attempt by any country, organization, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by means of political power, thereby resulting in a defendant not being able to have a fair trial that one should receive, is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of Hong Kong and should be condemned,” the city’s Security Bureau said in a statement.Lai, a British national and devout Catholic, is a longtime critic of the Chinese Communist Party and a prominent supporter of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. His imprisonment has drawn bipartisan support for his release in Washington and public backing from the UK government.“Jimmy Lai is British, not American. Given the high profile of his case, I doubt that China will be willing to make a deal,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.Supporters warn his advanced age, diabetes and prolonged solitary confinement threaten his health. Sebastien Lai, son of Jimmy Lai has said that he is hopeful that President Trump will be able to free him.“We’re incredibly grateful that the president knows about my father’s case and has said that he will free him,” Sebastien said. “The president has a tremendous track record in freeing prisoners around the world. So hearing this gives our family a lot of hope.”Paul Harris, former chairman of Hong Kong’s Bar Association, said that Lai’s presence in Hong Kong does not prevent his release. He explained that under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, the chief executive has both the authority and the responsibility, in certain cases, to pardon convicted prisoners or reduce their sentences.“So that power is there, and it’s a matter for the Chief Executive’s decision whether he wants to use it, and one can safely assume that if the President of China wants him to use it, he will use it,” Harris said, referencing Xi.","Jimmy Lai, 77, is accused of working with foreign forces, a crime under Beijing’s 2020 national security law that can lead to life in prison and a separate sedition charge.

Florida Republican Rep and a prominent MAGA spokesperson Anna Paulina Luna said she is certain that Congress has seen evidence of ""interdimensional beings"". What are interdimensional beings? Things that exist and travel between dimensions of space or time. Anna Paulina said she did not make this up and it's based on evidence she's seen. “And that’s not something that I came up with on my own. That’s based on stuff that we’ve seen. That’s based on information that we’ve been told,” she said on the Joe Rogan podcast.Luna, and Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, sent letters in February to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, asking for a briefing on all records connected to UAP -- unidentified anomalous phenomena.“Based on testimony that would be based on witnesses that have come forward. But what I can tell you is just we’re told that ... they’ve seen things,” Luna told Rogan.“And what I can tell you without getting into classified conversations is that there have been incidences that I believe were very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space,” she added. “Based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there are things out there that have not been created by mankind.”Luna leads a task force working on the declassification of federal secrets, organized by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She told Rogan that during her time working as an airfield manager with the Portland International Guard, she met F-15 pilots who had likely encounters with UAPs.“There’s definitely something that I can tell you with confidence, that we don’t know how to explain currently,” said Luna, adding that she believes information is being withheld.“When you have thousands upon thousands of people throughout time that have reported something, to say that those people are crazy, to say that the whole concept of just asking the question [may mean] that you are not psychologically sound, that in itself is a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” she said.Luna said she’s never seen a portal or a spaceship but was searching for documentation that could lead to more evidence of life beyond humans.","Rep Ana Paulina Luna said she is certain that Congress has seen evidence of ""interdimensional beings"" Luna, a prominent MAGA spokesperson, said she's never seen a portal or a spaceship but was searching for documentation that could lead to more evidence of life beyond humans.

Putin To Unveil Deadly ‘Invincible’ Nuclear Missile Right Before Trump Alaska Talks | WATCH





New Mexico’s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday have declared a state of emergency in Rio Arriba County due to rising violence and drug trafficking.This comes two days after President Donald Trump took control of Washington DC’s police force to combat violent crime in the Democrat-run capital.The county, which includes two Native American Pueblo communities and stretches from Española to the Colorado border, has long suffered from some of the nation’s highest opioid overdose death rates.Governor Grisham said local leaders had urgently requested help, as public safety threats had “overwhelmed local resources.”""When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,"" Grisham said in a statement. ""We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.""The declaration will provide $750,000 to the state department of homeland security and emergency management to coordinate the response and supply resources to affected communities.She said increased criminal activity has resulted in rising cases of homelessness, family instability and fatal drug overdoses.It has put a lot of strain on local governments and law enforcement. Police calls in Española and surrounding areas have doubled in the past two years and police dispatches to businesses have increased four times.The county’s drug crisis, driven largely by fentanyl, has become the worst in the state. Although no immediate troop deployments were announced, the declaration allows authorities to call the National Guard if needed. Emergency funds will help local law enforcement agencies in supporting overtime pay, new equipment and coordinated policing, as reported by Fox News.Local tribal leaders have also raised alarms. Santa Clara Pueblo Governor James Naranjo warned that fentanyl and alcohol abuse were harming children and impacting the wider community.""The Pueblo has expended thousands of dollars trying to address this crisis... and to protect Pueblo children who are directly and negatively affected by a parent's or guardian's addiction,"" said Santa Clara Governor James Naranjo in a July letter to Lujan Grisham. ""But we are not an isolated community and the causes and effects of fentanyl/alcohol abuse, increased crime and increased homelessness extend to the wider community. ""The move follows Grisham’s April decision to send the National Guard to Albuquerque to help address juvenile crime and the fentanyl crisis there.Republican officials welcomed the emergency declaration. Española City Councilor Sam LeDoux called it “a step in the right direction”.""I am pleased that the governor is addressing the out-of-control crime in our community,"" LeDoux said. It has long been overrun and not addressed. Fentanyl has overwhelmed our law enforcement, and this seems to be a step in the right direction to protecting our citizens.""New Mexico GOP Chairwoman Amy Barela have urged the governor to focus on solutions that address the root causes of crime.""This community is long overdue in receiving help to combat the out-of-control crime caused by the failed policies of our state leadership,"" Barela said in a statement.""While I hope the deployment of the National Guard will provide real assistance, the people of Española deserve more than just street counselors — they deserve action that addresses the root of the problem.""""Thanks to President Trump’s America First policies and his decisive action to secure the border, we have already begun to see crime rates decrease nationally. Now, it’s time to put New Mexicans first by ensuring those who commit crimes are caught and held accountable.""","New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has declared a state of emergency in Rio Arriba County due to rising violence and drug trafficking.

Pakistan announces Army Rocket Force Command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-announces-army-rocket-force-command/articleshow/123311070.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan turned its Independence Day celebrations on Thursday into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging headlined by the announcement of a new Army Rocket Force Command.The event at Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium, branded Marka-e-Haq (“Battle of Truth”), saw Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif share the stage with army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik, and Asifa Bhutto Zardari. Military representatives from Turkey and Azerbaijan added a touch of foreign endorsement.In his address, Shehbaz also unveiled “Misaq-e-Istehkam-e-Pakistan (Charter for Stability)”, pitched as a call for unity beyond partisan divides.The newly announced rocket force marks a first in Pakistan’s military structure, signalling ambitions for precision-strike capability. But with the economy still under strain, the decision is likely to spark debate over balancing strategic aspirations with fiscal realities.On foreign policy, Shehbaz expressed gratitude to China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, UAE, Iran, and, pointedly, US President Donald Trump, for support during tensions with India. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm positions on Kashmir and Palestine, indicating no softening of regional stances.The Independence Day spectacle underscored an image of civil-military unity in a country where political turbulence often overlaps with military dominance. Whether Marka-e-Haq becomes more than pageantry will depend on Islamabad’s ability to deliver on promises of reform, stability, and economic recovery long after the parades are over.","Pakistan turns its Independence Day celebrations into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging.

Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.

Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tablighi-jamaats-grip-on-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-fuels-concerns-of-radicalisation/articleshow/123203430.cms,"Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation





KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: The rise of the Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is sparking fears of cultural erosion and the steady grooming of recruits for radical movements. As reported by Himal Southasian, many Pashtuns say the orthodox Deobandi missionary group is dismantling traditional practices while quietly laying the ideological groundwork for extremism.In Bajaur district, a young resident told Himal Southasian that ""men and women used to dress fashionably, enjoy music, watch television, visit shrines, and play sports without being judged."" Today, he said, the Tablighi Jamaat's puritanical preaching has transformed local life. Activities once central to Pashtun culture are now branded as sinful. ""It has changed the cultural landscape drastically,"" he warned, noting that while the group does not directly preach violence, it produces ""raw human resources that can be easily turned into jihadists. ""Founded in colonial India in 1926, the Tablighi Jamaat is now a global organisation with millions of followers. In Pakistan, its headquarters in Raiwind, Punjab, commands vast influence.According to Himal Southasian, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has become one of the movement's most fertile grounds, with the group leveraging its ""quietist"" image to avoid official scrutiny while embedding Deobandi orthodoxy deep into Pashtun society.The group's impact is most visible in cultural change. Himal Southasian documents how shrines, folk music, mixed-gender dances, and colourful traditional clothing are being replaced by conservative dress codes and rigid segregation. A North Waziristan academic described the Jamaat as ""the root of evil... laying the ideological groundwork for the future Taliban"" and importing an ""Arab culture"" that dismisses Pashtun identity.While the Tablighi Jamaat insists it is apolitical and non-violent, Himal Southasian reports that it shares the sectarian orientation of groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Its close alignment with the Pakistan state's Islamisation project dates back to the 1980s, when military ruler Zia ul-Haq and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Deobandi networks - including Tablighi circles - to recruit Pashtun fighters for the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union. Former ISI chief Javed Nasir was himself a Tablighi Jamaat member.Critics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Himal Southasian that the group's influence has depoliticised Pashtun communities, discouraging discussion of exploitation or military abuses. This ideological shift, they argue, suits the Pakistani establishment, which has long used Islam as a tool for domestic control and foreign policy. A Peshawar lecturer warned that ""Tablighis are making our people orthodox, helping Islamist sectarian groups"" and turning them away from Pashtun nationalism and resistance to militancy.The group's gatherings draw hundreds of thousands annually to Raiwind and regional centres. A businessperson from Khyber district told Himal Southasian that almost every household in the tribal areas now has a member. The Jamaat's appeal as a ""peaceful"" alternative to militant brutality has made it a mass movement - but one that critics say nurtures a mindset receptive to Taliban influence.Perhaps most troubling, Himal Southasian notes, is the way the Tablighi Jamaat erodes ethnic identity in favour of pan-Islamic loyalty. This mirrors the Taliban's removal of Afghanistan's national flag in favour of the white shahada banner. ""Extremism and war have taken away every good thing from us,"" a South Waziristan student lamented.For Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's embattled Pashtuns, the rise of the Tablighi Jamaat represents more than religious revival - it signals Pakistan's ongoing project to reshape a proud, distinct culture into a pliant tool for its Islamist and geopolitical ambitions. As Himal Southasian's reporting makes clear, the consequences are already visible, and they reach far beyond the mosque walls.","Tablighi Jamaat's influence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province fuels concerns of radicalisation.

‘Unbelievable’: Body found almost intact after 28 years in Pakistan's melting glacier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/unbelievable-body-found-almost-intact-after-28-years-in-pakistans-melting-glacier-how-did-it-happen/articleshow/123155499.cms,"Image: X@/MarioNawfal





The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region. A shepherd, identified as Omar Khan, came across the well-preserved remains, clothing still intact, in the Lady Valley, located in the country’s eastern mountains.""What I saw was unbelievable,"" Omar was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.""An ID card was found with the body bearing the name Naseeruddin, allowing police to identify him as a man who went missing in June 1997 after falling into a glacier crevasse in the area.Once police confirmed the body was that of Naseeruddin, locals came forward with additional information, Khan said.Naseeruddin, who was married with two children, was travelling on horseback with his brother on the day he disappeared. The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

South Asia tensions: 3 Thai soldiers injured in landmine blast; Cambodia denies responsibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/south-asia-tensions-3-thai-soldiers-injured-in-landmine-blast-cambodia-denies-responsibility/articleshow/123206527.cms,".





Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lanka: Ex-minister from Rajapaksa family arrested for alleged corruption; first from once-powerful dynasty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-ex-minister-from-rajapaksa-family-arrested-for-alleged-corruption-first-from-once-powerful-dynasty/articleshow/123143702.cms,"Shasheendra Rajapaksa





Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles. Shasheendra’s cousins Namal and Yoshitha (Mahinda’s sons) are battling money laundering charges. Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of Chamal, Mahinda and Gotabaya, and an ex-minister, is under investigation for financial misconduct.Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades, which saw it default on $46 billion in external debt in 2022, triggering nationwide protests and a political upheaval.","Shasheendra Rajapaksa is a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda.

Afghanistan earthquake: Two tremors strike region within hours; no damage reported so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistan-earthquake-two-tremors-strike-region-within-hours-no-damage-reported-so-far/articleshow/123139919.cms,"Representative Image (ANI image)





An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.
