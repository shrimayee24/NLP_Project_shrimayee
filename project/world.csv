Saif Ali Khan’s condition

NEW DELHI: A man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was arrested on Sunday in Thane, news agency ANI reported quoting Mumbai Police. The incident took place early Thursday morning at Khan’s Bandra residence, where the actor was stabbed by an intruder wielding a knife.The suspect, identified as Vijay Das, also known by multiple aliases such as Bijoy Das and Mohammed Iliyas, was detained after a manhunt. Earlier, the Mumbai Police coordinated with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and had apprehended a 31-year-old while he was travelling on the Jnaneswari Express in Durg, Chhattisgarh, in connection with the attack. Das was brought into custody and will face further investigation.Police have recovered part of the weapon used in the attack at Khan’s residence.The arrested suspect, Vijay Das, reportedly operated under several aliases, including Bijoy Das and Mohammed Iliyas, the report said. Das worked as a waiter at a restaurant.The accused, Vijay Das, was apprehended by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) in a swift operation while travelling on the Jnaneswari Express in Chhattisgarh. Acting on a tip-off from Mumbai Police, RPF officers tracked the suspect’s mobile location and detained him at Durg railway station. His identity was confirmed through a photograph shared with the authorities.Authorities are investigating whether the stabbing was a botched burglary attempt or a premeditated assault on the actor. Early reports suggested the intruder may have been familiar with the building’s layout and security lapses, leading to speculation about his intent.Investigators relied heavily on CCTV footage, which showed the suspect moving through the building and later buying earphones at a nearby shop. Statements from the actor’s staff and neighbours also helped police piece together the suspect’s movements on the night of the attack.The horrifying incident unfolded at around 2.30am in Khan’s Bandra apartment. The intruder allegedly entered the premises unnoticed and confronted the actor’s son’s nanny, Philip, near the child’s room.Philip recounted in her statement that the man threatened her to stay silent and attacked when she resisted, injuring her hands and wrists. Saif Ali Khan intervened to protect his family but was stabbed multiple times during the altercation.The actor sustained serious injuries, including a 2.5-inch blade lodged in his thoracic spine, and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital. His wife, Kareena Kapoor, and staff member Geeta also suffered minor injuries during the chaos.Mumbai Police had mobilised 20 teams to investigate the incident, including officers from the Crime Branch and Bandra Police Station. No signs of forced entry were found, suggesting the intruder exploited a security lapse.The Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) has written to the Mumbai Police Commissioner requesting enhanced security for the actor.Doctors at Lilavati Hospital successfully removed the knife shard from Khan’s spine. The actor underwent emergency surgery and has since been moved from the ICU to a regular room. Neurosurgeons also treated deep wounds on his neck and hand, which required plastic surgery.Dr Niraj Uttamani, Chief Operating Officer of the hospital, said, “Saif is stable and recovering well. He remains under observation but is expected to make a full recovery soon.”","A man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was arrested on Sunday in Thane, news agency ANI reported quoting Mumbai Police.

CUTTACK: If a husband doubts his wife’s chastity without proof, she is “perfectly justified” to live separately and is also entitled to maintenance, Orissa high court ruled recently.Justice Gourishankar Satapathy noted this while upholding a Baripada family court order directing a man to payRs 3,000 monthly maintenance to his estranged wife. The husband had moved HC challenging the family court order.The couple had wed on May 5, 2021, but the wife left her marital home on Aug 28, 2021, allegedly because her husband raised doubts about her character. Claiming that his wife wasn’t entitled to maintenance as she had left him without sufficient cause, the petitioner (husband) questioned her chastity while alleging that she was in a relationship with another individual.While noting that the chastity of a woman is not only dearest to her but also her priceless possession, Justice Satapathy stated in his Jan 9 order: “When her husband raises doubt about her character, she is perfectly justified to refuse to live with her husband. In this case, without producing any proof about the infidelity of his wife, the husband has simply made character assassination of his wife, which itself is a ground for the wife to refuse to live with her husband.” While rejecting the man’s petition, HC said: “The plea of the husband in this case about the wife not staying with him without any sufficient cause is liable to be rejected and merits no consideration.”","Orissa high court upholds family court order directing a man to payRs 3,000 monthly maintenance to his estranged wife.

KOLKATA/MALDA: A 25-year-old murder accused , absconding after shooting two policemen escorting him to jail on Wednesday, was shot dead in an encounter while trying to flee to Bangladesh near the border in Chopra in West Bengal ’s North Dinajpur on Saturday morning.Sajjak Alam , being escorted back to Raiganj prison from an Islampur court where he was facing a murder trial, had requested ASI Deban Baishya and constable Nilkanta Sarkar to stop the prison van at Panjipara under Goalpokhar police station, claiming he needed to relieve himself. When the vehicle stopped, he fired four shots at the policemen and fled. An investigation revealed that the gun had been supplied to him by Abdul Hossain, a Bangladeshi criminal, on the court premises.Sajjak, carrying a 2-lakh bounty on his head, was intercepted by an eight-member police team led by DIG Sudheer Kumar Neelakantam at 7 am. He was asked to surrender but he responded by firing “three to four rounds” from his 9 mm pistol, prompting retaliatory firing. He succumbed to his injuries an hour later while undergoing surgery at a local hospital.The encounter occurred 48 hours after DGP Rajeev Kumar had said, “If someone fires at cops, we can fire back four times.” Kumar had rushed to Siliguri to visit the injured officers a day after Sajjak’s escape.ADG (Law and Order) Jawed Shamim said, “We are professionals. We are tough on criminals. Every officer, from constable to DGP, knows the risks when entering service. We are trained to respond appropriately. This is not the first time an encounter has occurred in Bengal.

NAGPUR/MUMBAI: An SECR RPF team Saturday said it has detained a suspect in last week’s attack on actor Saif Ali Khan from the LTT-Shalimar Jnaneswari Express at Durg railway station in Chhattisgarh . Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Mumbai police officials said there were reports of a person resembling the attacker shopping for headphones in a Dadar shop and later loitering outside the railway station.Nagpur railway police said the suspect, Akash Kannaujiya , 31, was caught in Durg after they missed him by a whisker at Nagpur, where the SECR headquarters reportedly received a precise tipoff on his location inside Jnaneswari Express, which crossed the station at 9.40am. His cellphone tower location again resurfaced when the train was heading to Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh. According to SECR sources, the RPF team scoured the train at Rajnandgaon station at 12.42pm, but failed to track him during its one-minute halt.Mumbai police had been intermittently receiving his tower location in Vidarbha, Nagpur RPF officials said. The cyber sleuths finally zeroed in on Jnaneswari Express, which had chugged out of Mumbai on Friday evening. Kannaujiya is suspected to have intruded into actors Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan’s Bandra home early on Friday and knifed Saif 6 times. A precise alert was sent to SECR headquarters, said Nagpur RPF sources, adding Kannaujiya changed trains over the past 48 hours, before boarding Jnaneshwari Express.Two RPF teams at Durg led by senior inspector S K Sinha, boarded the train in civvies after it reached the station at 1.35pm. “We started scouring the train for the suspect based on photos shared by Mumbai police. Constables Shriram and Nirmala were in the general coach. They had the images of the suspect on their mobile phone. Soon, cops in plainclothes noticed the suspect inside the general coach and he was nabbed and de-boarded,” said Sinha, adding Kannaujiya's image matched with the photographs sent by Mumbai police. “Mumbai police confirmed the suspect after a video-conferencing with us,” said Sinha.Sources said Kannaujiya was being questioned at the RPF thana at Durg.The actor was attacked around 2.30am last Thursday. According to the FIR, the intruder—described as a man in his late 30s with a slim build and dark complexion—was first spotted by stay-at-home nurse, Eliyamma Phillips, outside Saif’s son’s bedroom. Phillip said the intruder warned her to stay silent and demanded Rs 1 crore. As he attacked her with a knife, causing minor injuries, her screams woke up the son’s nanny Junu, who called out for help, prompting Saif and wife Kareena Kapoor Khan to come rushing. He then stabbed Saif.","Nagpur railway police said the suspect, Akash Kannaujiya, 31, was caught in Durg after they missed him by a whisker at Nagpur.

Academic pressure, love affairs behind suicides: Minister

(With inputs from PTI)

KOTA: A 16-year-old JEE aspirant allegedly hanged himself at his grandparents’ house Saturday, 48 hours after an another aspirant from Odisha killed himself in his hostel room in Kota. This is the fourth case of suicide in the city this year.According to police, Manan Jain, a Class XII student, had been living with his maternal grandparents’ to prepare for JEE for past three years. Cops received information about the incident at 9.15 am Saturday and sent the body for a autopsy, ASI Jawahar Singh said.The officer said Manan had studied with his cousin until midnight Friday. When he did not respond to calls in the morning, his cousin peeked into the room and found him hanging from the iron railing of the room’s window. He said no suicide note was recovered and the reason behind the suicide is yet to be ascertained.Meanwhile, the body of Abhijeet Giri , who died by suicide on Thursday, was handed over to his family after autopsy.Following suicides by four IIT-JEE aspirants in Kota in a span of 18 days, Rajasthan education minister Madan Dilawar on Saturday cited “romantic relationships”, apart from academic stress, among reasons for students taking such extreme steps, even as he urged parents to be watchful and avoid putting pressure on their children beyond their natural interests and abilities.Dilawar stressed that every student had unique interests and abilities, and when forced to pursue goals against these natural inclinations, failure often led to depression.The minister remarked that coaching institutes had minimal role in this and it was peer influence that played significant role because of constant remarks from other students about a student’s ranks.","Manan Jain, a Class XII student, had been living with his maternal grandparents’ to prepare for JEE for past three years.

"Pannun probe substantive, led to outcomes we desired: US envoy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-probe-substantive-led-to-outcomes-we-desired-us-envoy/articleshow/117307482.cms,"US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti. (Photo/PTI)

After the recent tensions over the Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder plot, the Biden administration looked to sign off on a positive note with India as outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti Thursday welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case, saying the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms .Garcetti told TOI in an interview that while the probe was not an end in itself, and the US would look forward to more steps, the outcome helped prove wrong the sceptics who believed there’s no way India and the United States would be able to navigate this issue and that what India was doing was mere “window dressing”.The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow, saying he saw Trump’s tariff focus as an invitation for dialogue on the issue, and not as a threat to start a trade war.“My assessment is it’s ( Pannun probe ) a really positive first step. We welcome it. It delivered what the private interactions I had with Indian officials promised. We said changes should be made to ensure this doesn’t happen again and people should be held accountable. It’s not the destination though. The report would be first to say that. It says it’s recommending a process for prosecution. And just like in our system, facts come out and things happen. But this is substantive. It moves the ball forward and we look forward to steps in the future,"" said Garcetti, when asked about the outcome of the probe which suggested the plot might have been a ‘lone wolf’ operation.On Canada’s ongoing probe into similar cases and alleged Indian involvement, which it has linked to higher-ups including the Indian home minister, Garcetti said he didn’t have any knowledge about it at all. “I believe both of our countries have independent criminal justice systems, which are outside our intelligence systems and have to pursue facts that can hold up in a court of law. I don’t want to speak for Canada. I know it to be the case in America. My friends in Canada would say they have a similar system. I think often we see connections that don’t exist,’’ said the ambassador.Garcetti said the fact that Trump has close ties with PM Narendra Modi and the fact that he has appointed people considered pro-India as NSA and secretary of state augurs well for ties. He described Biden as the most pro-India president in US history and Modi as the most pro-US PM. “And when President Biden said this is the most important country to me when he asked me to take this position…I think he proved it. Things like ICET, envisioning IMEEC…or the work we are doing in Fiji, or southeast Asia or Africa is not just additive but also multiplicative. That legacy will be an amazing foundation for the Trump administration to further build on but will also stand on it as the brightest chapter,’’ he said.Trade war doesn’t help anybody, said Garcetti when asked about Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on India and others. “If we want to outcompete our main competitors…want to have a China plus one strategy, It’s not enough to have good intentions. We have to reduce tariffs further. We have to create a corridor that is trusted between our technologies. The way I hear it from the president-elect, it’s an invitation to sit down at the table, not a threat to start a trade war,’’ he said.On the US focus on human rights, minorities and freedom of speech, Garcetti said both India and the US needed to guard against misinformation and to ensure a sense of belonging for all, but added US wasn’t looking to teach or preach. “That’s for the Indians to determine. India says we will not comment on you and please don’t comment on us. America says we are going to comment on you, please do comment on us. We have a slight difference there. There have been moments when I have been blown away by the vibrancy of the Indian democracy. There are fair, free elections that are an example for others,’’ he said.Asked about some of the most challenging issues he faced during his tenure, including India’s ties with Russia and the murder-for-hire case, Garcetti said there was nothing the 2 sides could not overcome even though there were conversations that weren’t easy. “Sometimes we have to disagree on things. But we resolved our trade disputes. We are navigating through criminal cases – both what happened to Indian diplomats in San Francisco and in terms of what happened to American citizens like in the Pannun case. Democracies are complex, diverse populations are difficult to manage but it reminds me of America a few decades ago. If we put our minds together, there’s nothing we can’t do,’’ he said.","Outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case.

AGARTALA: Two hearts are breaking on either side of the India-Bangladesh border. One is a man, Atikur, a Bangladeshi, and the other is his meandering pachyderm, Chandratara.For Atikur, life without Chandratara is unimaginable. Not a single day would pass that they didn’t see each other. But Atikur is now fighting a legal battle to bring her back from a foreign country.Chandratara, a captive elephant who Atikur claims is his, had inadvertently crossed over to a border village near western Kailashahar , in Tripura’s Unakoti district, through an unsecured area on Sept 11 last year. Forest officials took custody of the elephant, sparking a legal battle for ownership between Atikur and two other claimants from India.“After being informed by BSF that an elephant was roaming along the border, we rescued her. Immediately, two villagers claimed ownership, but weren’t able to give proof. We took the elephant into custody after that,” a senior Indian wildlife official said.Atikur has sent photographs and ownership documentation to BSF and Tripura forest department through his Indian relatives. In a video message, he said, “India is a great country and I have immense respect for the law of this land. I trust the legal complexities will soon be resolved, and I will be reunited with my elephant.” He said Chandratara likely became disoriented and crossed the border while searching for food. Atikur has also filed a general diary at Kamalganj police station in Bangladesh and submitted a grievance to Border Guard Bangladesh. His relative has initiated legal proceedings in Unakoti district court.A wildlife official said the case will be heard on Jan 21.","Chandratara, a captive elephant who Atikur claims is his, had inadvertently crossed over to a border village near western Kailashahar.

I’ve been framed, culprits allowed to go free, says Roy, claims involvement of IPS officer

KOLKATA: A Sealdah court found former Kolkata police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy guilty of raping and murdering a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year, delivering the verdict during a 12-minute session Saturday after a 66-day in-camera trial, which began on Nov 4 and heard 50 witnesses.“The allegations against you say the victim was sleeping when you attacked her. You strangled and smothered her and she died. You assaulted her sexually. You are proven to be guilty based on witnesses’ accounts and documents placed before the court. You are convicted of the crime,” Judge Anirban Das said. Roy, 35, stood expressionless as the judge read out the verdict.The court will hear Roy and his lawyer before pronouncing the sentence Monday. Judge Das informed Roy that the death penalty was an option under BNS sections 64, 66, and 103(1).“It may be a life term or even death, given the way you throttled and killed the victim,” he said.The victim’s father, present in court, broke down. Addressing judge Das with folded hands, he said: “The faith we had in you has been completely vindicated today. Our heartfelt gratitude to you.”Kolkata police arrested main accused Roy a day after the crime. CBI assumed charge of the case three days later.On Oct 7, the central agency submitted a 45-page chargesheet detailing evidence against the civic volunteer—a contractual worker who assisted police, typically with minor tasks. He was sacked after the crime.The crime, marked by its brutality and audacity, triggered widespread protests. The largest demonstration occupied Kolkata’s streets on Aug 14-15. It also prompted a 10-week agitation by junior doctors, culminating in a 16-day hunger strike, which was called off on Oct 21.CM Mamata Banerjee met the striking doctors four times during this period.On Saturday, the Sealdah court complex was heavily guarded with nearly 300 policemen and officers as hundreds of citizens gathered outside. Roy was brought from Presidency Jail under a police escort.The media was permitted to witness the courtroom proceedings when the judgment was delivered.The proceedings commenced at 2.30pm. Standing in the witness box, Roy stayed silent for the most part. He maintained his innocence and repeated that he was being framed when the judge asked whether he had anything to say.“I have not done this. Those who have done this have been allowed to go free. I wear a rudraksha mala; it would have been torn had there been any scuffle,” Roy said, while alleging the involvement of an IPS officer.Judge Das assured Roy he would be allowed to speak again on Monday before the sentence was pronounced.Concluding the session, Judge Das mentioned the involvement of former RG Kar medical college principal Sandip Ghosh and other officials in the investigation, adding that their actions raised some questions.“I have taken the entire chain of events point by point. Some activities (of the officials) created some confusion in my mind. That has been explained in the judgment,” he said.",Former Kolkata police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy found guilty of raping and murdering a 31-year-old resident doctor.

KOLKATA: The conviction of Kolkata Police’s former civic volunteer Sanjay Roy in the rape and murder of a resident doctor at her workplace sparked differences among political parties, though they unanimously called for the “severest punishment”.TMC celebrated the verdict as a validation of Kolkata police’s initial investigation. “Police arrested the perpetrator within 24 hours. But a section of people tried to spread misinformation and mislead people to fulfil their political and personal interests... We want death penalty for the RG Kar convict,” said TMC’s Kunal Ghosh.Ghosh criticised those who questioned the police probe, claiming they had been proven wrong. “…investigation was on the right path, despite some leftists, extreme leftists, blind TMC opponents, and a section of doctors using people’s emotions with political intent to tarnish govt’s image,” he said.BJP alleged a cover-up. Party’s Bengal chief Sukanta Majumdar said: “The court has convicted him (Roy), but the people of Bengal believe more than one person may have been involved. When the case was being investigated by Kolkata police, evidence was tampered….”Majumdar said Roy might have been framed and called for further investigation. “Roy has said several times that he was being trapped and there was a conspiracy against him... We want the court to order a probe into who tried to silence him,” he added.SUCI announced plans to hold a rally Tuesday demanding “proper justice” for the victim. “…here only one accused was found, though there are chances of the presence of multiple people at the crime scene, according to the forensic evidence,” said SUCI’s Chandidas Bhattacharya.CPM also raised doubts. Party’s Sujan Chakraborty posted on X: “A verdict in just 12 minutes! A verdict doesn’t necessarily mean justice. ‘Setting Bengal’ has become even clearer today. Justice must be seized. We want justice.”",Kolkata Police’s former civic volunteer Sanjay Roy convicted in the rape and murder of a resident doctor at her workplace.

KOLKATA: As news of main accused Sanjay Roy’s conviction in the RG Kar rape-murder case was broadcast on TV Saturday, his sister broke down in tears. “He should be punished if he committed the crime, but I am not sure if he was the only one responsible for it. However, we have faith in the judiciary ,” she said.Standing in front of her house in a slum, she said: “I have been following the news since the beginning. I cannot even imagine the brutality with which the doctor was killed. But is it possible for a single person to commit the rape and murder in such a short span?” The woman said she had not visited the court room where her brother was pronounced guilty.She added she had not been on good terms with her mother and brother in recent years. While she did not challenge the trial court judgment or the CBI investigation, she pleaded with the authorities to uncover the full truth. “The real culprits should not be spared. I am not sure if my brother will appeal in any higher court.”Roy’s mother said: “I don’t know what has happened. I was worried earlier. But now I have stopped worrying and left it to his fate. At this age, I can only shed tears.”Roy’s legal team raised several concerns about the investigation process. His lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay said: “We spoke to him in custody, and he claimed his hair was torn off while in custody of Kolkata police. The videography of sample collection is incomplete. The samples need to be sealed and handed over to the investigating officer immediately after the autopsy, but it was given to the IO after three days.” Kabita Sarkar, another lawyer who initially represented Roy, said, “Why was there a rush in conducting the autopsy and cremation of the victim? As the accused’s lawyer, I have not yet seen the viscera report,” said Sarkar, who was present in court.","Main accused Sanjay Roy’s conviction in the RG Kar rape-murder case was broadcast on TV.

The Feb date was chosen for the meeting because of the model code of conduct in force for assembly elections in Delhi.Dallewal (70), a cancer patient, has been fasting since Nov 26.

A decision regarding the fast of 121 other farmers is expected Sunday.Saturday’s announcement was made at Khanauri after Union agriculture ministry’s joint secretary Priya Ranjan read out a letter about the upcoming meeting and handed it over to the protesting farmers. Ranjan emphasised govt’s concern for Dallewal’s health. “Our delegation came with a proposal from central govt, and we were asked to speak to the leaders of farmer forums,” he said.Dallewal’s health has deteriorated since he addressed from a stage a mahapanchayat amid severe cold at Khanauri protest site on Jan 4.

Saif got family in corridor, tried to trap intruder in room, say police

MUMBAI: Nearly 48 hours after the incident, the intruder who attacked actor Saif Ali Khan and his domestic staff during a burglary attempt remained untraced. Teams formed by Bandra police and Mumbai Crime Branch were yet to disclose details about the investigation when reports last came in, but Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Yogesh Kadam ruled out involvement of organised gangs.Khan, who suffered stab wounds on his spine, neck, and hands, was “doing well” post-surgery, according to doctors. He walked around and ate regular meals at the hospital on Friday. He was moved from the ICU to a special room, said doctors. Depending on progress, he may be discharged on Monday.A suspect, who resembled the person seen in the CCTV grab at Khan’s apartment in Bandra, was picked up from south Mumbai. During interrogation it was found he was a drug abuser who was home at the time of the crime. He was released on Friday afternoon.At least 20 teams have been formed so far to trace the assailant. Several, including two carpenters who had carried out furniture work in the actor’s home two days ago, were questioned. Khan’s wife Kareena Kapoor gave her statement to police on Friday. Police are also tracking mobile data to check on the presence of new numbers in the locality at the time the incident occurred.Bandra police have registered the case based on the domestic help, Eliyamma Phillip’s statement. According to Philip, she was the first to spot the intruder near the room where the actor’s son was sleeping. She made sure the child was safe before confronting the man. Her screams alerted the others. During the confrontation with the burglar, despite being stabbed with a knife, Khan managed to gather everyone behind him in the corridor and pull the door of the room to trap him inside.An investigating officer said Khan managed to gather everyone behind him in the corridor and pulled the door of the room to trap the intruder inside, but in the commotion, failed to lock the door from outside. This helped the intruder escape when Khan, his wife, their children and the staff rushed out to get help.Police are not yet conclusive about the route taken by the intruder after leaving the building. Bandra police believe he took the fire escape stairwell to reach Khan's 11th floor residence. ""There's a second image of the intruder, his face covered with a mask. It was captured on the sixth floor. And after the attack, he left by the same route. His face was not covered while leaving the building,"" said a source.The intruder's image was captured only on the stairs in the building. There are not many CCTVs in the locality. The domestic help told police that there are no CCTVs on the floor leading to the actor's flat nor any inside the flat.""His arrest will tell us how he managed to enter the flat. If he used a tool to pick the door lock or take some other route to enter the toilet,"" said police.

Saif’s kurta was soaked in blood

In the early hours of Thursday morning, a routine drive turned into a critical moment for 47-year-old auto-rickshaw driver Bhajan Singh Rana . He found himself transporting Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra following a stabbing incident at the actor's residence.Rana was near the Satguru Darshan building , where Saif resides, when he heard urgent calls for help. “I was driving my rickshaw and suddenly heard someone shouting, ‘Rickshaw ruko (stop the rickshaw),” Rana recalled.A woman and others flagged him down. “The person whose white kurta was soaked in blood got in the auto. I noticed he had neck and back injuries but did not see the hand injury,” he added. “At first, I thought it was a regular assault case,” he recalled.Saif, visibly injured, approached the rickshaw and entered. “He walked towards me himself and sat in the auto. He was in an injured state. A small child and one more person were with him,” said Rana.Despite stab wounds to his neck, back, and stomach, Saif remained composed. “He asked, ‘Kitna time lagega (How much time will it take to reach the hospital)?’” Rana recounted.Initially, the plan was to go to Holy Family Hospital, but the passengers decided on Lilavati Hospital instead. Rana drove swiftly, reaching the hospital in about 10 minutes. “I just took a U-turn and stopped the auto at the gate,” he said.Upon arrival, Saif revealed his identity. “It was only when we reached the hospital gate that he called the guard to fetch a stretcher, saying he was Saif Ali Khan,” said Rana.In his injured state, Saif refused to use a wheelchair. “A wheelchair was brought for him, but he refused to sit on it. Then stretchers were brought, and he lay down on one before being taken inside,” said Rana.Saif’s white kurta was soaked in blood, but he managed to walk on his own. “There were three people in total — Saif, a kid, and a young man. He seemed normal while I was taking him to the hospital,” Rana added.The journey ended around 3 am. “His white kurta turned red, and there was a lot of blood loss. Even after getting out of the rickshaw, he walked on his own. I didn’t take any fare,” he said.Rana admitted to feeling scared about the situation, fearing potential trouble.

NEW DELHI: Ministry of external affairs (MEA) Friday denied any contradiction between what the Army chief, Upendra Dwivedi, had said this week on disengagement with China in eastern Ladakh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar 's statement earlier in Parliament on the issue. While MEA has maintained that disengagement at friction points Depsang and Demchok has been completed, the Army chief had said there's still a ""degree of standoff'' left between the militaries.""We do not see any contradiction between what the Army chief has said and the position that we have taken.

Where the Oct 21 understanding is concerned, our objective has been to ensure patrolling, as in the past, to the relevant patrolling points, as well as resumption of grazing by our civilians as per longstanding practice,'' said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. Jaiswal recalled that Jaishankar had also underlined that the ""task of de-escalation remains to be addressed"".""This is indeed what we have agreed upon with regard to Depsang and Demchok.

Bangladesh cancels Hasina's visa

Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has revealed details of an alleged assassination plot against her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana, after her ousting from power. ""Rehana and I survived—just 20-25 minutes apart, we escaped death,"" Hasina said in an audio message posted on the Bangladesh Awami League 's Facebook page.The 76-year-old leader was ousted from power, fleeing to India last year after a student-led revolution toppled her government amid protests and clashes that claimed over 600 lives.Reflecting on the events, Hasina alleged a coordinated conspiracy to eliminate her and described surviving multiple assassination attempts as a divine intervention.""I feel it is the will of Allah that I have survived—the August 21 grenade attack , the Kotalipara bomb plot , and now this recent threat,"" she said emotionally. ""Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive today.""""I just feel that surviving the killings on August 21, or surviving the huge bomb in Kotalipara, surviving on this time August 5, 2024, there must be a will of Allah, a hand of Allah"", the deposed PM said, adding, ""although I am suffering, I am without my country, without my home, everything has been burned.""This is not the first time that there has been an assassination plot against Hasina the August 21, 2004, grenade attack, which targeted Hasina during an anti-terrorism rally in Dhaka, killed 24 people and injured over 500. Hasina narrowly escaped with minor injuries. Similarly, in 2000, a 76kg bomb was discovered in Kotalipara, where she was scheduled to address a rally.Hasina’s exile has been marked by intensified scrutiny. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has issued arrest warrants against her for alleged enforced disappearances during her 15-year rule, with prosecutors accusing her administration of abducting over 500 individuals. ""She must face justice for crimes against humanity,"" stated Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to Bangladesh’s interim government.Meanwhile, Dhaka has formally requested her extradition from India. The extradition treaty between the two countries lacks a clear timeline, leaving her fate uncertain. The government has hinted at building international pressure to ensure her trial.Hasina, however, maintains her defiance. ""Although I am without my country and my home, I believe Allah’s mercy has kept me alive for a reason,"" she said tearfully, reaffirming her resilience amidst growing challenges.The Bangladesh interim government in response to reports of India extending the visa of Hasina had earlier clarified that visa matters are irrelevant once a passport is canceled.The Bangladesh government had revoked the passports of 97 individuals, including Hasina, for alleged involvement in protests-related crimes. foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam confirmed passport cancellations are shared with diplomatic missions.","Sheikh Hasina has revealed details of an alleged assassination plot against her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana.

Hoodie sparks tension at 30,000 feet

Viral outrage

Spirit Airlines responds

A Texas man was escorted off a Spirit Airlines flight after refusing to remove his hoodie bearing the phrase “FVCK HATE WORLD TOUR,” sparking a viral debate about freedom of expression and airline policies .John Garcia Jr, 43, was flying from Los Angeles to San Antonio when the incident unfolded, as documented in a Facebook video posted in the group 210 La Chismosa. The clip shows Garcia confronting flight attendants over what he called an “unfair” and “surprising” decision, reported the San Antonio Express-News.“It caught me totally by surprise,” Garcia told the San Antonio Express-News. “Like, ‘Man, are you serious?’”The father of four had just stowed his luggage when a female flight attendant questioned his seating. After confirming his seat, she walked away, only to return minutes later with a demand: remove the hoodie due to its “obscene language” or leave the flight.Garcia refused, arguing that his sweatshirt wasn’t offensive. Spirit Airlines’ policy states passengers may be removed for “lewd, obscene, or offensive” clothing, but Garcia questioned whether the phrase violated any specific guidelines, reported San Antonio Express-News.As tensions escalated, a male flight attendant joined in, presenting an ultimatum: the hoodie comes off, or Garcia gets off. Feeling cornered, Garcia eventually removed the hoodie but was still escorted off the plane.The incident quickly went viral, with fellow passenger Andrew Martin Hoel posting a video online. In the clip, Hoel dubbed the flight attendant a “Karen” and criticized her for misinterpreting the sweatshirt’s anti-hate message .“What’s this world coming to… his shirt literally is anti-hate, and he got hated on,” Hoel wrote.Online commenters rallied behind Garcia, calling the airline’s actions an overreach. “I hope he sues the s–t out of Spirit,” one person wrote, while another quipped, “It said ‘FVCK HATE.’ Should we be promoting people to HATE?”In a statement, Spirit Airlines said, “We want all our guests to feel welcome and have a great experience while traveling with us. We are aware of the video, and our team is investigating.”Garcia, a father of four, booked another flight to San Antonio but endured a grueling 12-hour layover. Meanwhile, the incident has reignited conversations about free expression, corporate discretion, and the blurry line between provocative and inappropriate.","John Garcia Jr, 43, was flying from Los Angeles to San Antonio when the incident unfolded.

Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's southwestern ADIZ.In recent weeks, China has been visibly boosting its ability to invade Taiwanese beaches with innovative new naval equipment. This includes the formal launching of an enormous landing helicopter assault (LHA) vessel, the likes of which no other navy in the world possesses, and mass production of floating bridge docks to assist the unloading of ships during beach landings. Both type of equipment are strong indications that China is serious about one day invading Taiwan.The Taiwan-China issue is a complex and longstanding geopolitical conflict centred on Taiwan's sovereignty. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates its own government, military, and economy, functioning as a de facto independent state.However, China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and insists on the ""One China"" policy, which asserts that there is only one China, with Beijing as its capital.This has fuelled decades of tension, especially since the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), when the ROC government retreated to Taiwan after the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, took control of mainland China.Beijing has consistently expressed its goal of reunification with Taiwan, using diplomatic, economic, and military pressure to isolate Taiwan internationally.

"Patients dying in hospital corridors, say British nurses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/patients-dying-in-hospital-corridors-say-british-nurses/articleshow/117365290.cms,"File photo

LONDON: Patients are dying in the corridors of Britain’s hospitals. Pregnant women are receiving miscarriage treatments in semipublic places. Incontinent patients are cleaned next to vending machines. Those are just some of the shocking revelations in a report published Thursday by the Royal College of Nursing, a British nursing union. In the report, nurses described an overcrowding crisis that they said has led to a collapse in care, confidentiality and dignity across the country’s National Health Service.“Vulnerable people are being stripped of their dignity and nursing staff are being denied access to vital lifesaving equipment,” Nicola Ranger, the general secretary and CEO of the union, said in a statement. The nation’s healthcare staff had reached a “breaking point,” she added in the report.The 460-page report, which features anonymised testimony from over 5,400 nurses surveyed from Dec 18, 2024 to Jan 11, is the latest mayday from British medical professionals. The union granted its members anonymity in order to speak freely, preventing repercussions from employers and protecting patient confidentiality, a spokesperson said.Doctors and nurses have struggled to care for the nearly 70 million people in the UK after years of challenges, including chronic underinvestment in the NHS under Conservative-led govts that held power from 2010 to 2024.The report described how patients have had to wait for CPR as nurses struggled to manoeuvre through a cramped corridor to get there in time. Often, patients endured unhygienic conditions, nurses said. Some had been sprayed with each other’s vomit. Incontinent patients are cleaned in corridors without privacy. The toll is particularly evident for dying people. Patients have had to face their own deaths in cramped and busy places, according to the report, without any privacy. A corpse was discovered in hallways hours after death, a nurse said.“This must be a watershed moment, a line in the sand,” Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said in a statement. Boyle was one of several leading British physicians to express solidarity with the nurses. He called the testimonies “harrowing.”The report, which de scribes a crisis of “corridor care,” comes just months after another blockbuster report found that the NHS was in “critical” condition. Patients routinely waited hours for treatment as doctors tried to work without adequate medical equipment or sufficient space in hospitals, according to that report, which was commissioned by the govt.Many Britons see a functioning NHS — which was created after World War II and delivers healthcare that is free at the point of use to all Britons through a tax-funded model — as a core obligation of their govt.","Nurses say overcrowding has led to a collapse in care, confidentiality and dignity.

President Biden was unsure if he signed a critical executive order during a conversation with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson last year, according to a revelation by Johnson, who said he left the meeting concerned about the nation's leadership.In an interview with Free Press, Johnson claimed that Biden insisted to Johnson that he never issued an order to freeze new liquid natural gas export permits , despite signing it less than a month earlier. The House speaker told the podcast host Bari Weiss that he believed Biden ""genuinely didn't know what he had signed.""The meeting reportedly took place in the Oval Office in early 2024, where they discussed the latest aid package for Ukraine. Johnson questioned Biden over an executive order pausing new permits for American liquid natural gas exports to European allies, a crucial issue for his constituents in Louisiana.""Why would you do that? Cause you understand we just talked about Ukraine, you understand you are fueling Vladimir Putin 's war machine, because they gotta get their gas from him,"" Johnson said he told Biden.Biden appeared bewildered, Johnson noted. ""I didn't do that,"" the president responded, according to Johnson.""Sir, you paused it, I know. I have the export terminals in my state. I talked to those people in my state, I've talked to those people this morning, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security,"" Johnson recalled telling the president.After initially denying the export freeze, Biden eventually remembered signing the order, explaining it was meant to study the fuel's effects.""I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, 'We are in serious trouble—who is running the country?'"" Johnson said.The interview also got a reaction from Tesla and X owner Elon Musk . ""As I said a few years ago, Biden was not in charge. Whoever controlled his teleprompter was,"" he said.A December report revealed that White House aides had been covering up Biden's mental decline since the beginning of his term, rearranging his schedules and limiting in-person interactions, according to the New York Post.Meanwhile, Biden admitted in a USA Today interview that he wasn't sure if he would have had the ""vigor"" for another term had he won re-election. He dropped out of the 2024 race following a debate performance against now-President-elect Donald Trump , where he gave garbled answers and lost his train of thought. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who was defeated by Trump in November's presidential race.","House Speaker Mike Johnson recalled meeting with Joe Biden in 2024.

Chicago to see immigration raids next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chicago-to-see-immigration-raids-next-week/articleshow/117365160.cms,"Reuters photo

WASHINGTON: The incoming Trump administration intends to carry out “post-inauguration” immigration raids in Chicago next week, according to two people familiar with the planning and correspondence reviewed by The New York Times, an opening step in Trump’s goal to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.The plan, called “Operation Safeguard” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would start Tuesday, the day after Trump is inaugurated, and last until the following Monday, according to the people familiar with it and the correspondence. The dates were still being finalized, however, and could change.The size of the planned operation was unclear. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) routinely conducts deportations in cities throughout the US. But the agency was taking additional steps to ramp up enforcement for the operation and tied it to Trump’s inauguration in a message sent to personnel throughout the agency.Hundreds of agents were asked to volunteer and participate in the “post-inauguration” operation targeting immigrants in the United States illegally. ICE is planning on sending roughly 150 agents to Chicago for the raids.For Trump, the optics of immigration agents sporting ballistic gear and arresting immigrants with uncertain or contested status in a Democratic-led city could be enough. The incoming administration is eager to find ways to send a message that it is cracking down on immigrants without legal permanent status and punishing so-called sanctuary cities — communities like Chicago that refuse to hand over immigrants.Don Terry, a spokesperson for the Chicago police, said the department would not “intervene or interfere with any other govt agencies performing their duties,” but that it “does not document immigration status” and “will not share information with federal authorities.” The planned raids were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Tom Homan, Trump’s pick to oversee his promised mass deportations, has said the public should expect immigration action in the early days of the Trump presidency that creates “shock and awe.”","The plan would start Tuesday, the day after Trump is inaugurated, and last until the following Monday.

Donald Trump arrived in Washington on Saturday evening (local time) to celebrate with family, supporters, and political allies ahead of his second inauguration as president on Monday, according to the Assoicated Press reports.This marks a triumphant return for the Republican four years after he left the city following the Capitol attack by his supporters.Trump travelled aboard Special Air Mission 47 from West Palm Beach, Florida, accompanied by Melania Trump and their son Barron. The flight number acknowledges his upcoming role as the 47th president. The customary practice involves the departing administration providing government aircraft access to the incoming leadership. However, when President Joe Biden was preparing for his inauguration in January 2021, this tradition was not observed by Trump's administration, necessitating Biden's travel to Washington aboard a private chartered plane.The celebration began with a fireworks showcase at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles outside Washington. He arrived in the capital as organisers scrambled to move most of the outdoor inauguration day events, including the swearing-in ceremony, inside due to forecasted frigid temperatures. This will be the first time since President Ronald Reagan's second term in 1985 that the ceremony will be held inside the US Capitol.In a phone interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said, ""I think we made the right decision. We'll be very comfortable now.""The inauguration will feature performances by country music stars Carrie Underwood, Billy Ray Cyrus , and Jason Aldean, as well as appearances by actor Jon Voight and wrestler Hulk Hogan. Tech executives Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Shou Zi Chew are also expected to attend.On the inauguration eve, Trump will take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Sunday, followed by a rally at Capital One Arena and a private dinner.Then, on the Inauguration Day, Trump will participate in the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for tea with the outgoing president and first lady. The swearing-in ceremony will be held inside the Capitol Rotunda due to the cold weather, followed by an indoor parade and a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.As the soon-to-president looks forward to the formal oath, protesters began taking to the streets in the morning as a light sleet fell. Melody Hamoud, a Washington resident, wore a pink hat from the 2017 march protesting Trump's first inauguration, saying, ""I just didn't want to sit home and fret in front of the TV. I wanted to feel like our movement still has energy and be around others who felt the same.""Meanwhile, talking about the decisions that his administration would work on, Trump confirmed he would likely grant an extension allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US beyond Sunday when a law prohibiting its distribution takes effect. He also stated that his administration would begin its effort to follow through on a campaign promise of mass deportations of migrants living in the country without legal permission ""very early, very quickly.""","Donald Trump arrived in Washington on Saturday evening (local time) to celebrate with family, supporters, and political allies.

Trump's Huge TikTok Announcement In US; Chinese App's CEO Thanks President-Elect | Watch

US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said he had not made a final decision but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after his inauguration on Monday.Under a law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, TikTok's China-based parent company was given nine months to sell its US operations to an approved buyer. The law, set to take effect on Sunday, prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to US users. However, the sitting president has the authority to grant an extension if a sale is underway.Trump told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview, ""I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate. You know, it's appropriate."" He added, ""We have to look at it carefully. It's a very big situation.""The President-elect said if he decides to grant the extension, he will likely announce it on Monday.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco clarified on Friday that the Biden administration would leave implementing the law to Trump, given that his inauguration falls the day after the ban takes effect.In a statement released Friday, TikTok requested a definitive response from the Biden administration, asking that it not enforce the law or fine app store operators and other US companies if TikTok remains available after Sunday. Without assurances, TikTok warned it might ""go dark,"" without specifying whether it would voluntarily suspend its US operations or shut down after losing access to essential service providers.On Saturday, the White House dismissed TikTok's statement as a ""stunt."" Jean-Pierre said, ""We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.""","US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country.

Traditional Jewish law typically restricts government activities during Sabbath except for life-threatening emergencies.Netanyahu has directed a specialised team to prepare for the hostages' return from Gaza, with affected families receiving confirmation of the agreement. The agreement includes the release of numerous Palestinian detainees and promises increased humanitarian assistance to the severely damaged Gaza region.A preliminary list of 737 Palestinian prisoners, primarily women and minors, has already been published by Israel’s justice ministry.The war, triggered by Hamas’s cross-border attack, has left over 46,000 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza’s health ministry, with international calls for a ceasefire growing louder.","Israel's Cabinet endorsed a ceasefire agreement for Gaza, which would secure the release of numerous hostages and temporarily halt the 15-month conflict with Hamas.

LIVE: Thousands attend protest in Washington D.C. ahead of Donald Trump inauguration

Thousands of people from across the United States gathered in Washington, DC, on Saturday to rally for women's reproductive rights and other causes they believe are threatened by the incoming Trump administration. The march, held days before President-elect Donald Trump 's inauguration, echoed the original Women's March that occurred eight years ago at the start of Trump's first term.Marchers expressed their determination to support issues such as women's access to abortion, transgender rights , and combating climate change. The event was one of several protests, rallies, and vigils planned ahead of the inauguration, with over 350 similar marches taking place across every state in the country.Jill Parrish, a participant from Austin, Texas, shared her reason for attending the protest: ""Most importantly, I'm here to demonstrate my fear, about the state of our democracy."" Rick Glatz from Manchester, New Hampshire, said, ""I'm a grandpa. And that's why I'm marching.""Demonstrators marched to the Lincoln Memorial for a larger rally and fair, where organizations at various levels hosted information tables. They carried signs with slogans such as ""Save America,"" ""Against abortions? Then don't have one,"" and ""Hate won't win.""Brief moments of tension arose between protesters and Trump supporters, but police intervened and peacefully separated the groups.Rachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of Women's March, stressed perseverance, saying, ""Before we do anything about democracy, we have to fight our own despair.""The rally, rebranded as the People's March, sought to broaden support during a reflective moment for progressive organizing following Trump's decisive win in November. While the crowd was significantly smaller than the 500,000 marchers who attended the Washington rally in 2017, participants remained committed to their cause.","Thousands of people from across the United States gathered in Washington, DC, on Saturday to rally for women's reproductive rights.

New Yorker sued for allegedly pouring 'bucket of urine' on TikTok photo booth owner: 'This is war!',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-yorker-allegedly-pours-bucket-of-urine-on-tiktok-photo-booth-owner-sued-for-500k/articleshow/117359507.cms,"Maggie Trakas and the screenshot of urine being thrown on photo booth customers (Picture credit: New York Post)

'Poured a bucket of urine onto Minton’s head'

Allegations of ‘Deranged’ behavior

Feces vandalism alleged by owners

Trakas alleges money extortion

Owners of a TikTok-famous vintage photo booth in New York have sued their neighbor, Maggie Trakas, for engaging in aggressive and unsanitary behavior towards them and their customers. Trakas was so upset by the photo booth set up next door to her Lower East Side home that she allegedly threw a bucket of urine onto the owners and customers, according to the lawsuit.Zoë Lazerson and Brandon Minton, the owners of the popular vintage photo booth located on the Lower East Side in New York City, claim that since opening in December, Trakas has been attempting to disrupt their business. The lawsuit alleges that Trakas has thrown a bucket of urine from her second-story window onto Minton and waiting customers, painted feces along the booth's fence and planters, and made verbal and physical threats.""This is war!"" Trakas reportedly said the day after the booth relocated to its new, more popular location at 145 Allen St. on December 9, according to the lawsuit.On January 5, the lawsuit claims Trakas “leaned out of her second-floor window and poured a bucket of urine directly onto Minton’s head, causing the urine to splash onto queuing customers.” It adds that responding police officers and paramedics confirmed the substance was urine.“While the police and paramedics were writing reports of the incident, Trakas was laughing and taunting the plaintiffs and customers,” the suit states, also alleging she had been drunk earlier in the day and knocked Minton’s phone out of his hands.“I threw vinegar on him later that day,” Trakas said, as quoted by the New York Post. “It was not urine.”“It was cleaning vinegar because he’s been calling me and threatening me,” she said, claiming he referred to her as a “scum bag, Karen, miserable bitch.”She also denied assaulting Minton, saying that he was shoving his phone in her face.The lawsuit alleges that the truly ""deranged"" actions started this month when Trakas referred to booth visitors as “narcissistic r—-ds” on January 2.“I said it was narcissism on steroids,” Trakas told The New York Post.The following day, according to the lawsuit, Minton found “frozen urine” on a chair next to the photo booth.Trakas admits to supergluing locks on Minton's maintenance van, claiming it was in response to him vandalizing her bikes.The most serious allegation in the lawsuit involves Trakas allegedly painting a plywood board with feces and dumping the remains into planters installed by Minton.Minton claims that he arrived at his booth one morning to find it covered in a foul-smelling substance. In the complaint, Minton says that he ""observed what appeared to be feces smeared and dumped all around [a] planter box."" He also alleges that video footage from the night of the incident shows Trakas using ""a paint can filled with brown liquid feces"" to deface a plywood board he had recently installed to block her view of the booth. Minton claims that he and his team had to wear KN-95 masks and spend over three hours cleaning the booth.The lawsuit seeks damages for the alleged vandalism and the time and effort required to restore the photo booth to its original condition. In addition to seeking over $500,000 in damages, the social media influencers have already been granted a temporary restraining order, preventing Trakas from interfering with or vandalizing the booth.Trakas denies the allegations of throwing urine and claims that the lawsuit is an attempt by the booth owners to extort money from her before the potential ban of TikTok, the platform largely responsible for the booth's popularity, according to a report by New York Post.""On the weekends and over the holidays, it has been unmanageable,"" Trakas said, referring to the long lines of people waiting to use the photo booth. ""We're talking up to hundreds of people on the line, all the same age demographic. No one local, not even NYU.""To Trakas, the lawsuit represents “wealthy kids from Utah who showed up in 2023” attempting to “exploit” her.“My sense is because this is a TikTok sensation and Sunday, TikTok might be going away, he’s getting nervous and coming after me and fabricating incredible lies,” Trakas said.The case is ongoing, and both parties maintain their respective positions on the alleged incidents.",Maggie Trakas allegedly threw a bucket of urine onto the owners and customers of a photo booth set up next door to her home. The owners of the photo booth claim that Trakas has been attempting to disrupt their business.

"Left out in the cold, MAGA fumes at tech elites surrounding Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/left-out-in-the-cold-maga-fumes-at-tech-elites-surrounding-trump/articleshow/117357941.cms,"WASHINGTON: They planned for months, booking flights and rental cars, hotel rooms and Airbnbs, in the tens of thousands, mostly non-refundable reservations. They snapped up tickets to the inauguration, some 220,000 of them, and the lucky ones cadged invitations to exclusive inauguration parties and balls. For Donald Trump and his MAGA millions from across the country, his inauguration was going to be a party like never before.Then Trump announced that an Arctic blast -- which will dump snow on Sunday night and drive temperatures as low as -10c on the morning of the inauguration at noon on Monday -- is pushing the spectacle indoors inside the US Capitol where only a few hundreds can be accommodated, which means place only for the VIPs and elites.Left out in the cold, the disappointed MAGA flock is now making the best of the weather-driven debacle, casing the city for bars and restaurants to watch the spectacle on television. Many have cancelled their trips and are grumbling about the elites bowing to the weather on such a milestone for the movement. ""Trump’s inauguration is being moved indoors due to the dangerously cold weather. At this point let’s just move it to Mar-A-Lago!"" pro-Trump lawmaker Matt Gaetz joked.Democrats are having a field day at MAGA disquiet with snarky gags. Among them ""The great thing about moving Trump’s inauguration to the rotunda (the central hall of) is that all of his supporters already know how to get there,"" a reference to the January 6 uprising when some MAGA elements stormed the Capitol.Except this time only Trump VIPs will get to be at the rotunda. One daily published a photo of a forlorn Navin Adhari, a volunteer who was folding up chairs that have been laid out in neat rows in front of the Capitol steps, with the caption ""Imagine being the guy who just set up 100,000 chairs on the National Mall and they announce they’re moving the inauguration.""Even in the moment of MAGA triumph conspiracy theories abound. Some MAGA principals are suggesting that the real reason Trump was forced to move the inauguration inside is because of extreme security concerns. ""Helicopters are scanning the area for 'nuclear irregularities'"" one Trump supporter wrote on X while another who defended the move indoors argued that the threat from drone attacks has reached unprecedented levels and all it takes is one small drone with poison on the end to take out any world leader.There is as much attention on who won't attend the inauguration as who will. Trump loyalists are excoriating Michelle Obama and Nancy Pelosi for skipping the event, forgetting that Trump and his family did not attend the Biden inauguration either. Others are finding joy in entertainers such as Carrie Underwood and Snoop Dogg, neither of whom are Trumpists, performing at the inauguration.Some are still unhappy over the Trump surrounding himself with tech elites, of whom Bill Gates is the latest to talk up the MAGO Supremo, after a ""long and actually quite intriguing dinner with him"" at Mara Lago last week. Others are even more agitated over foreign tech honchos attendign the inauguration. ""Why is the CCP affiliated TikTok CEO getting front-row access to President Trump’s inauguration? This is a national security threat and goes against everything MAGA stands for. TikTok has been labeled a danger to our country, yet its leadership is being welcomed during one of our country's most significant events,"" raged Laura Loomer, the incendiary Trump loyalist.","Donald Trump's inauguration is being moved indoors due to the dangerously cold weather.

"NYPD Reward: NYPD awards $10,000 to teens who helped capture NYC subway killer after initial denial",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nypd-awards-10000-to-teens-who-helped-capture-nyc-subway-killer-after-initial-denial/articleshow/117358021.cms,"The NYPD has finally decided to give $10,000 in reward money to three heroic teenagers after initially denying them due to a technicality, New York Post reports.The boys, all 14, were praised for their quick thinking and bravery in reporting a subway arson suspect , but were first told they were ineligible for the reward because they used 911 instead of the Crimestoppers hotline .The families of Kingson, Navid, and Christos had felt overlooked when they asked about the promised reward. The NYPD had initially informed them that since the boys called 911, they didn’t qualify. “They told me that since the kids didn’t use the tip hotline and called 911, that’s why they’re not eligible,” Navid’s father said.However, after public outcry and criticism from media reports, the NYPD reversed its decision. The young heroes will now evenly split the reward, and they will also receive a Nintendo Switch, according to their families.“It’s good news. Thank you for picking up on it because I don’t know if this would have happened any other way,” Christos’ mother said after receiving the call. Another parent expressed surprise at the quick turnaround: “It’s interesting. You write an article and then all of a sudden they’re scrambling to do this… literally in that matter of 24 hours?”Despite the good news, there was confusion at first about why the families were misled. Neither the NYPD nor Crimestoppers had kept the families’ contact information, making it unclear how they would be reached if the reward was reconsidered. This raised concerns that the teenagers might miss out on what they deserved.The situation attracted attention from generous individuals, with former MTA chairman and one-time New York Post owner Peter Kalikow stepping in. Kalikow, who created the “See Something, Say Something” slogan, publicly supported the boys and offered to personally match the reward. “These young men called 911 and identified the criminal who set this poor woman on fire and took action to help in his capture,” Kalikow said. “The fact that they didn’t have the Crimestoppers tip line shouldn’t deprive them of this well-earned reward.”The teenagers, overjoyed by the news, have described feeling “over the moon.” Their quick actions on the subway not only led to the arrest of the suspect but also inspired countless New Yorkers to step up and commend their bravery.“It’s good to know people see the value in what we did,” Christos said. “We just did what we thought was right.”On December 22, Navid, Kingson, and Christos spotted suspect Sebastian Zapeta-Calil on a Queens-bound F train. Hours earlier, Zapeta-Calil, a 33-year-old man, had allegedly set a homeless woman named Debbie Kawam, 57, on fire while she slept on the train. The teenagers quickly took action, calling 911 to report their sighting. Law enforcement soon stopped the train, and Zapeta-Calil was arrested.","The boys, all 14, were praised for their quick thinking and bravery in reporting a subway arson suspect.

'Get Out, Illegal Aliens': Trump's Shocking Mass Deportation Raid Order | Key Details

Trump administration planning 'large-scale immigration raid' Tuesday in Chicago: Reports

The US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) will carry out large-scale arrests of undocumented immigrants nationwide starting Tuesday, according to Tom Homan, a top border official in the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump . The move aligns with Trump 's campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States.Homan, who previously served as the acting director of ICE and oversaw a policy that separated migrant parents and children at the border during the first Trump administration, told Fox News, ""There's going to be a big raid across the country. Chicago is just one of many places.""""On Tuesday, ICE is finally going to go out and do their job. We're going to take the handcuffs off ICE and let them go arrest criminal aliens,"" he added.Homan stressed that while the focus will initially be on ""public safety threats,"" no one is exempt from deportation if they are in the country illegally.""What we're telling ICE, you're going to enforce the immigration law without apology. You're going to concentrate on the worst first, public safety threats first, but no one is off the table. If they're in the country illegally, they got a problem,"" he said.Reports from the Wall Street Journal and other US outlets suggest that the ""large-scale immigration raid"" in Chicago is expected to commence on Tuesday, a day after Trump's inauguration, and ""last all week,"" involving 100 to 200 ICE officers.Don Terry, a Chicago police spokesman, told the New York Times that the department will not ""intervene or interfere with any other government agencies performing their duties."" However, he clarified that the department ""does not document immigration status"" and ""will not share information with federal immigration authorities.""Chicago is one of several Democrat-led US cities that have declared themselves ""sanctuaries"" for migrants, meaning individuals will not be arrested solely for lacking legal immigrant status.","US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) will carry out large-scale arrests of undocumented immigrants nationwide starting Tuesday.
