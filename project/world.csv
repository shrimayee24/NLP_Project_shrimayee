BJP's jibe at Naveen Patnaik's 'penance' attack: 'Would've spoken Odia properly',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-jibe-at-naveen-patnaiks-penance-attack-wouldve-spoken-odia-properly/articleshow/115057757.cms,"NEW DELHI: Odisha minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Krushna Chandra on Thursday hit back at former chief minister Naveen Patnaik over his recent 'did penance for 12 years' remark and said the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) did nothing for the state.Responding to Patnaik's statement targeting the BJP government over mango kernel deaths in Kandhamal district, Chandra said, ""Naveen Patnaik said he did penance for 12 years but we (BJP) have spoiled everything. However, he didn't do anything.""""Had he done anything, he would have been able to speak Odia properly. Even after so many years, he cannot speak Odia properly, he cannot even speak English properly. He has done nothing for Odisha,"" Odisha minister said.Earlier in the day, BJD president Patnaik held the Odisha government accountable for the deaths of two women who died after consuming mango kernel gruel in Kandhamal district.According to the former chief minister, insufficient food supplies at home compelled the tribal women to consume the gruel, whilst the BJP government maintained their stance that food poisoning caused the deaths.""The state government has stopped the provision of rice for poor tribals. Therefore, they were forced to eat mango kernel gruel. Two people have died and others are undergoing treatment. This is very sad,"" Patnaik stated whilst addressing party student wing members at the BJD headquarters.He voiced his concerns about the current government's decisions, stating they had undermined the BJD administration's previous work in ensuring sufficient grain distribution. Patnaik, who served as Odisha's chief minister from 2000 to 2024, highlighted that his government had implemented a state food security scheme for those not covered under the NFSA.""Now, the current government has ruined all those efforts and, as a result, people are forced to eat mango kernel gruel because they're not getting rice,"" Patnaik stated.Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare minister KC Patra dismissed these claims, countering, ""As many as 16 people had died by eating mango kernel in Tikiri and Kashipur blocks of Rayagada district during the BJD government . Will Patnaik admit that these people died for not getting rice to eat?""The minister confirmed that medical reports indicated food poisoning as the cause of death, not rice scarcity. He further stated that consuming mango kernel gruel was customary among tribal communities, adding, ""The mango kernel does not impact their lives, but this time it was stale for 4/5 days and became poison.""","Odisha minister Krushna Chandra hit back at former chief minister Naveen Patnaik over his recent 'did penance for 12 years' remark. Chandra said the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) did nothing for the state.

Broader Implications for the Entertainment Industry

The term "" Diddy List "" refers to a purported compilation of celebrities and public figures allegedly associated with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' controversial parties, particularly the so-called ""Freak Off"" events. While the authenticity and accuracy of this list are subjects of debate, several high-profile individuals have been mentioned in various reports and online discussions. Notable names include:Leonardo DiCaprio: The acclaimed actor has been linked to Diddy's gatherings, though no official allegations have been made against him.Jay-Z and Beyoncé: The power couple has been mentioned in connection with Diddy's events, but there is no concrete evidence of their involvement in any misconduct.Jennifer Lopez: As Diddy's ex-girlfriend, she has been associated with his parties; however, no allegations have been directed at her.Usher: The singer has been linked to Diddy's events, with some reports suggesting he witnessed inappropriate behavior, though he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Paris Hilton: The socialite has been reported to attend Diddy's parties, but there are no allegations against her.Kim Kardashian: The reality TV star has been mentioned in connection with Diddy's gatherings, though no evidence suggests her involvement in any misconduct.Russell Brand: The comedian has been linked to Diddy's events, but there are no specific allegations against him.Mariah Carey: The singer has been associated with Diddy's parties, though no allegations have been made against her.Megan Fox: The actress has been mentioned in relation to Diddy's events, but there is no evidence of her involvement in any misconduct.Prince Harry: The British royal has been named in some reports, though there is no concrete evidence linking him to any inappropriate activities.Sean “Diddy” Combs, a major figure in the music industry, is currently at the centre of a series of serious legal battles, including allegations of misconduct and abuse. These developments, involving a mix of allegations, surveillance footage, and testimonies, are attracting significant media attention and sparking wider debates about accountability in the entertainment industry.In May 2024, CNN released a 2016 surveillance video showing Combs allegedly assaulting his former partner, Cassie Ventura, in a California hotel. The video depicts Combs grabbing Ventura by the neck, throwing her to the ground, and dragging her along a hotel corridor. This footage was revealed amid Ventura’s ongoing legal action against Combs, alleging years of abuse—a case reportedly settled shortly after it was filed.Adding to the controversy, Courtney Burgess, a former associate of Combs’ late ex-girlfriend Kim Porter, testified to a grand jury that he has flash drives containing at least eight tapes involving Combs and various celebrities, including alleged minors. Burgess claims these recordings were given to him by Porter before her death in 2018. Homeland Security has subpoenaed Burgess for any related materials as part of the federal investigation.Combs faces multiple charges, including racketeering and trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty and remains in custody without bail. Federal investigators are exploring allegations of Combs hosting “Freak Off” parties, reportedly involving non-consensual acts and male escorts, some of whom were minors. Witnesses have provided detailed accounts of these events, which are under close scrutiny by authorities.Combs’ legal team strongly denies all allegations, stating that any interactions were consensual. They have also accused prosecutors of leaking the 2016 assault video to damage Combs’ reputation ahead of his trial. Prosecutors, however, refute this claim, asserting that they were unaware of the video prior to its release by CNN.Following these developments, Combs filed a motion to expedite a gag order, attempting to curb public statements by potential witnesses. Combs' attorneys argue that such statements are undermining his right to a fair trial and affecting the grand jury’s proceedings. The legal team contends that restricting these extrajudicial comments is necessary to avoid prejudicing the court’s decisions.On October 31, Burgess appeared on NewsNation’s Banfield, alleging that Kim Porter had provided him with 11 flash drives containing videos featuring celebrities, some of whom were minors and allegedly intoxicated. Combs’ lawyers contend that Burgess’ claims, made across various platforms, are sensationalised and without merit, claiming they unfairly prejudice the case. Prosecutors have countered, arguing that the plaintiffs’ involvement in civil litigation places these statements outside criminal court jurisdiction.The allegations against Combs and the suggestion that other high-profile individuals may be involved have reignited discussions about power dynamics within the entertainment sector. Calls for increased transparency and accountability continue to grow, as the industry faces ongoing scrutiny regarding ethics and misconduct.","The term ""Diddy List"" refers to a purported compilation of celebrities and public figures allegedly associated with Diddy's controversial parties.

A tragic incident occurred on Tuesday evening at the construction site of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train corridor in Vasad village, leading to the death of three workers and injuring another. The mishap involved the collapse of a temporary steel and concrete structure used for well foundation work near the Mahi River.Initial reports suggested that an under-construction bridge had collapsed. However, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) clarified that the incident involved a temporary structure for well foundation work. The structure, made of steel and concrete blocks weighing 2.5 tons each, was supported by high-tensile (HT) strands. The collapse was attributed to the snapping of these strands, causing the blocks to fall and trap four workers.Swift rescue operations were launched, involving cranes, excavators, local volunteers, and assistance from the state administration, police, and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Despite their efforts, three workers lost their lives, while one survivor is undergoing treatment.Anand Superintendent of Police Gaurav Jasani confirmed, ""Three workers died, and another is undergoing treatment at the hospital.""

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

It is now the turn of Democrats devastated by the election loss to yell voter fraud and float conspiracy theories after preliminary figures showed a massive 13 million drop in ballots for Kamala Harris compared to what Joe Biden polled in 2020.Provisional numbers show Donald Trump polling close to 72.5 million votes (50.9 per cent) nationwide against Kamala Harris' 68 million (47.8 percent). In comparison, Biden polled more than 81 million votes (51.3 percent) in 2020 compared to Trump's 74 million (46.8 percent) in 2020. Overall turnout shows that 155million voters cast ballots in 2020 (during covid) compared to only 139 million in 2024.Harris supporters are now asking how there could be a massive 13 million drop in ballots for the Democratic candidate who by their accounts generated large crowds and perceptible voter enthusiasm during an energetic campaign. There is also a 16 million drop in voting overall.While the straightforward answer appears to be 13 million Democrats (or those who voted Democrat) in 2020 simply stayed home for various reasons (sexism/gender, racism, weren't enthused by Harris and/or her policies), some Harris supporters are alleging a election heist, variously attributing it to Russian interference, Chinese hand, Musk mischief etc.They are also cherrypicking stray Trump quotes during the campaign, including the times he told his supporters ""we don't need the votes...I have so many votes,"" ""don't worry about voting...we have all the votes we need,"" and ""you never have to vote for me again after you vote for me this one time.""Despite his conflicting remarks, preliminary analysis of voting data and exit polls indicate Trump's managed to enthuse his MAGA base far better than Harris galvanized Democrats, millions of whom appeared to have bailed out on her despite her massive financial advantage, more coordinated campaign, and better ground operations. In contrast, the MAGA campaign was chaotic and sketchy, with only Trump and Elon Musk carrying the torch.Trump was also powered by Latino and black men who voted for him in greater numbers than in 2020, even as Harris underperformed with the much-bruited support for her from women. In fact, in almost every state and county across the country, Harris underperformed Biden in 2020 even as Trump overperformed his own numbers in 2020 and 2016, pointing to a massive MAGA surge that surprised even Republicans.Ironically, it was Trump himself who alerted his social media followers to potential election fraud just before polls closed on Tuesday, posting about about some disturbances in Philadelphia and warning ""law enforcement is coming!"" Nothing more was heard from him rest of the evening as counting began.While Harris supporters kvetched about the 13 million to 16 million votes ""missing"" in the 2024 elections, Trump supporters clapped back saying the numbers indicated Democrats stole the 2020 elections, something the MAGA supremo has often alleged. ""The scariest thing about the 2024 election is that someone created almost 20 million Democrat votes out of thin air in the 2020 election but decided not do it in 2024,"" read one post on X.","Provisional numbers show Donald Trump polling close to 72.5 million votes (50.9 per cent) nationwide against Kamala Harris' 68 million (47.8 percent) Overall turnout shows that 155million voters cast ballots in 2020 (during covid) compared to only 139 million in 2024.

From China to Middle East: What Trump's return as US president could mean for allies and adversaries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-china-to-middle-east-what-trumps-return-as-us-president-could-mean-for-allies-and-adversaries/articleshow/115052002.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Nato and Ukraine remain cautiously optimistic

European leaders' mixed response reveals underlying tensions

Middle East faces uncertainty

The China situation remains complex

Defying pollsters and election experts, Donald Trump is set to return to the White House as the 47th President of the United States of America. Trump emerged victorious against his rival and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris on Wednesday after surpassing the 270 electoral college votes required to win.The international community now watches anxiously to assess if Donald Trump's second stint as president would bring the same level of global instability that his allies anticipate.During his first term, Trump's approach strained relationships with many traditional US partners. His return to the White House carries significant implications across various domains, including worldwide commerce, environmental policies, and numerous international disputes and conflicts.Trump's agenda includes ramping up the tariff war with China, America's emerging economic and military competitor. Regarding the Middle East situation, he has made promises to resolve conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Additionally, he has also committed to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict within his first few days in office, raising concerns among Ukraine's supporters about potential concessions favouring Russia.Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte extended congratulations to Trump, saying, ""I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through Nato"" amidst ""a growing number of challenges globally,"" including ""the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.""During his first term as the US president, Trump frequently criticised Nato, questioning other members' financial contributions. His recent statements suggested the USA might not protect Nato members failing to meet defence spending requirements. European officials worry about Trump's committment to Nato, despite his push for increased European military expenditure.Rutte maintained an optimistic stance, acknowledging Trump's previous success in encouraging member states to increase defence spending, noting Nato's enhanced position.European nations are currently assessing contingency plans should American defence support become uncertain.As Ukraine's primary military supporter against Russian aggression, the US relationship remains crucial. ""Do not try to predict Trump's actions. No one knows how he is going to act,"" a Ukrainian MP said.""He could ask Putin to freeze this war, and he says 'OK',"" a front-line soldier was quoted as saying by BBC. ""It's the worst scenario because in a couple of years, the Russians will advance again and might destroy us."" ""The second scenario is if Putin refuses,"" he said. ""There is a chance Trump will react radically. That is a more promising scenario.""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy endorsed Trump's ""peace through strength"" approach.""This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,"" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. ""I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.""Zelenskyy later said, ""I had spoken to Trump and congratulated him on ""his historic landslide victory—his tremendous campaign made this result possible. I praised his family and team for their great work. We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation.""Meanwhile, Moscow remained silent, with Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that US-Russia relations were at their ""lowest point in history.""Leaders across Europe hastened to extend congratulations to Trump, even before official confirmation of his victory.The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer described it as a ""historic election victory"" and said that ""as the closest of allies, the U.K. and U.S. will continue to work together to protect our shared values of freedom and democracy."" Starmer's centre-left government has invested considerable effort in establishing connections with Trump and his associates, including a dinner meeting at Trump Tower in September.Emmanuel Macron of France offered measured congratulations with ""respect and ambition,"" whilst German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that ""surely many things will be different under a Donald Trump-led administration"" despite expressing desire for continued close relations.European officials stress upon the enduring nature of transatlantic relations beyond individual leadership, though concerns persist about Trump's protectionist economic policies, given his previous implementation of tariffs on European metals.During his first term as US President, Trump tried to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Currently, attention centres on how he will respond to the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as their primary supporter, Iran.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's victory as ""history's greatest comeback.""""Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!"" Netanyahu posted on social media.Despite their previously strong alliance as conservative nationalists, Trump and Netanyahu's relationship deteriorated when Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's 2020 victory. Whilst Netanyahu's close advisers hope for Trump's support against Israel's adversaries, Trump's decisions remain unpredictable. Additionally, Netanyahu faces domestic challenges, including recent nationwide protests following his unexpected dismissal of defence minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday.Hamas released a brief statement indicating that their stance towards the new US administration would depend on its approach to Palestinian rights and interests.In a congratulatory note to Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasised the need for both nations to navigate their differences and establish harmony in a new phase of relations.According to Chinese state media, Xi told Trump that historical evidence shows mutual benefits from cooperation, whilst confrontation proves detrimental to both parties.However, Chinese experts remained sceptical, pointing to potential increases in trade tariffs and growing tensions regarding Taiwan. As president, Trump imposed tariffs on over $300 billion of Chinese imports. This time around he has said the tariffs could be in excess of 60%.""It is not all dark, but there are more challenges than opportunities,"" Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing was quoted as saying by news agency AP. ""We are clear about the challenges. As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.""Ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea continue to strain US-China relations in Asia, likely requiring significant attention from the incoming American administration.Leaders across Asia, concerned about China's increasing influence and North Korea's nuclear capabilities, rushed to send congratulatory messages to Trump, seeking his engagement.","Donald Trump is set to return to the White House as the 47th President of the United States of America.

Trump's Personal Qualities:

One of the more intriguing aspects of this presidential race has been the plethora of Indian-Americans on both sides of the aisle, demonstrating that ABCD now stands for America-Born Confirmed Desis. While the Republicans have representation from Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Usha Vance, Kamala Harris stands out on the Democrat side. The Biden Administration has also appointed numerous Indian-origin members, with Kash Patel emerging as the latest ABCD entrant, and Trump’s prospective pick for CIA chief.The Indian-origin American is considered the 'ultimate Trump loyalist' and previously played a key role in aiding Republicans’ efforts to discredit the Russia election interference probe. The former Republican House staffer has held senior positions within defence and intelligence during Trump’s prior administration.Several Trump allies have advocated for Patel’s appointment as the next CIA director. However, this role requires Senate confirmation—a process made easier after Republicans secured a majority on Tuesday. Should Senate approval not be forthcoming, Patel may be appointed as a member of the National Security Council.What makes Kash Patel’s views more compelling is his perspective on issues that markedly diverge from those of the US establishment and media. During the Ram Temple consecration, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) expressed concerns, telling VOA they were “troubled” by the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The New York Times described it as “A Triumph Toward a Hindu-First India,” and CNN reported, “Ayodhya Ram Mandir : India PM Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site.” Patel accused Washington newspapers of only covering the past 50 years of history.He remarked to a leading daily in February: “To bring things really up to date, the opening of Ram’s Temple, when PM Modi went there, all the Washington newspapers only covered the last 50 years of history. They forgot the 500 preceding years. Whether or not you are Hindu or Muslim, there was a Hindu temple there for one of the quintessential gods in the Hindu pantheon in 1500 that was toppled, and they have been trying to get it back for 500 years.”He added: “But the Washington establishment forgot that part of history to put on what I believe is a disinformation campaign that’s harmful to India and the PM’s position. They’re using that because I think they liken Trump and Modi as similar figures, and the establishment class in Washington doesn’t want that to be the case.”In fact, Patel’s proposed ascendancy has an interesting side story. For those unfamiliar with Hindu mythology, a pivotal part in the Ramayana involves a squirrel. When Lord Rama’s army was building the bridge to Sri Lanka, a small squirrel, eager to help, began carrying tiny stones and dust to contribute. Lord Rama, noticing the squirrel's dedication, blessed it by stroking its back, leaving three white stripes as a symbol. In a recent twist, New York authorities caused outrage among MAGA supporters by euthanizing a pet squirrel named Peanut, and during Kamala Harris’s concession speech, a squirrel darted across the stage—sparking jests about divine intervention. On Diwali, Donald Trump condemned violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, pledging to protect Hindu-Americans from what he labelled the “radical left’s” anti-religion agenda. He highlighted his commitment to a “great partnership” with India and PM Modi, delivering a Diwali message aimed at a minority traditionally resistant to the Republican Party but showing increased openness to conservative support.Trump’s remarks resonated with concerns among Hindus about the neglect of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. He also referenced California's contentious Senate Bill 403, intended to outlaw caste discrimination, which many Hindu-Americans see as unfairly targeting their community. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill, stating that existing laws sufficiently address caste discrimination, with rumours that VP Kamala Harris played a role to keep Hindu support within the Democratic Party. Trump’s praise for Modi, calling him both a friend and a “total killer” when necessary, aligns with his outreach to Hindu-Americans, contrasting with figures like US Ambassador Eric Garcetti, who has criticised India’s handling of recent diplomatic tensions with Canada.PM Narendra Modi was also one the first leaders who spoke to Trump after he won and the US President-elect called PM Modi a 'magnificent man' who was loved by 'the whole world'. Patel asserts Trump sees America as a global leader, not isolationist, with a commitment to securing American interests first and working closely with allies like India.Trump and Modi share mutual respect, Patel says, fostering a strong partnership focused on tackling shared threats, including terrorism and China’s regional influence.Patel claims Trump’s approach to China was more effective than Biden’s. Trump treated China as a serious threat, employing diplomatic, economic, and military measures to counter it and protect US interests.Patel describes Trump’s unpredictability as a strategic advantage, keeping adversaries off balance and deterring threats from countries like Iran and North Korea.Drawing from his immigrant background, Patel supports Trump’s strict stance on immigration, emphasising border security while maintaining lawful immigration to balance security and economic needs.Patel stresses the importance of US-India tech partnerships, especially in AI and quantum computing, which he views as crucial for national security. He criticises Biden for overlooking this partnership.Patel argues there’s a “two-tier justice system” biased against Trump and conservative views, alleging political agendas have overridden public service.Patel notes Trump’s emphasis on equitable contributions within NATO, asserting that allies should contribute fairly, a stance Patel claims challenged norms but promoted balanced alliances.Patel claims some US liberals’ criticism of Modi’s policies aims to create division, while Trump respects Modi’s governance, prioritising the broader US-India alliance over internal politics.Patel describes Trump as approachable and detail-oriented, suggesting his focus on personal connections has helped retain a loyal advisory team.",Kash Patel is considered the 'ultimate Trump loyalist' and previously played a key role in aiding Republicans’ efforts to discredit the Russia election interference probe.

America elected its first criminal president before electing its first female president.

'Nostradamus' Allan Licthman blames democracy after failure to predict Trump win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-licthman-blames-democracy-after-failure-to-predict-trump-win/articleshow/115058858.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



The “Keys to the White House” Model: A Look Inside



Concerns Over Democracy



A System Under Strain: Evaluating the Keys



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and the Changing Political Landscape



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century

American historian Allan Lichtman, often called the "" Nostradamus of US elections,"" found himself at a loss for words when his prediction of Kamala Harris ’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections proved incorrect. Lichtman and his son Sam hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he was seen saying, “I don’t get it,” as Donald Trump moved closer to clinching victory.Visibly fatigued, stressed, and disappointed by the election outcome, Lichtman commented, “Good thing I have nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” In related coverage, the battle in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remains “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman observed, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump secured a historic victory, surpassing the required majority to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the result as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.“This is the first moment of the night where I’ve lost hope a little bit,” Sam Lichtman admitted as news outlets announced that battleground Pennsylvania had gone to Trump.In a separate statement, Canada’s pro-Khalistani leader Jagmeet Singh shared his concerns following Trump’s win.Lichtman, expressing dismay, remarked that he hoped Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He further shared his disbelief, stating, “I just can’t wrap my mind around how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.”Concluding his livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline around the world, and America has now fallen in step. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For over four decades, Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House "" model with striking accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor believed that Harris would emerge victorious in the 2024 election, convinced by the model's indicators that pointed towards a Democratic win. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s landslide victory, Lichtman found himself caught off-guard, live-streaming his disbelief alongside his son, Sam. The political soothsayer was left pondering what went awry, even joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on a set of 13 true-or-false factors designed to assess whether conditions favour the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model suggests a loss for the incumbent. The keys range from economic performance and social stability to candidate charisma and major policy accomplishments. Lichtman believed that Kamala Harris had eight keys in her favour, with Trump falling short by several indicators. According to this analysis, Harris should have had a clear path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s advantages under keys like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators typically benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. However, despite these favourable predictions, the electorate appeared to move in an unexpected direction, leading to Trump’s decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model highlights potential limitations when applied to an increasingly unpredictable political landscape.As the election results unfolded, Lichtman’s initial disbelief soon gave way to deeper concerns for the future of democracy. At one point during the live broadcast, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” capturing his fears of an era marked by fragility in democratic institutions. This sentiment went beyond his failed prediction and reflected a broader apprehension about the future of democratic governance, particularly given Trump’s polarising leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman expressed that once democracy is eroded, its restoration is often an uphill struggle. He referenced historical precedents where authoritarian rule only ended through significant upheaval, such as wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, attempted to lift his spirits, optimistically noting that they might not need to worry about Trump’s influence post-presidency. Lichtman, however, remained unconvinced, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He emphasised that the erosion of democratic norms globally, particularly in the 21st century, has been an alarming trend.Since its inception, Lichtman’s model has been heralded as a robust alternative to traditional polling, which often misses nuanced voter sentiment. Developed after analysing patterns in presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model was intended to cut through polling noise and highlight the broader conditions that typically sway elections. Its 13 true/false statements each support or oppose the incumbent's chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include the presence of a strong economy, absence of major scandals, and whether the challenger lacks charisma.Here’s a quick overview of some of the critical keys that Lichtman relied on:Party Mandate – Incumbents often benefit if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates a unified front, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows sustained growth, it usually supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment boosts the incumbent’s chances.No Scandal – Absence of scandals preserves public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This key favours the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.For 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris held the advantage with eight keys, signalling a stable foundation for a Democratic win. However, the actual outcome suggests that the political and social undercurrents at play were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now certain, Lichtman’s rare miscalculation may underscore how shifting political dynamics have impacted the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly feature unexpected variables, including the growing influence of disinformation, polarisation, and the changing nature of voter loyalty. Lichtman’s model, while historically insightful, may face new challenges in accounting for the electorate’s evolving motivations.Furthermore, the 2024 election was notable for a heightened emotional atmosphere, with strong divisions across party lines. Trump’s polarising yet powerful rhetoric appealed to a substantial portion of the American electorate, particularly those disillusioned by the status quo. While Harris was backed by indicators that should have tipped the scales, voter sentiment appeared to lean towards a familiar figure promising change, albeit in a more controversial manner.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His remarks about democracy’s precarious state reflect a larger worry: that American democracy, like many others worldwide, faces unprecedented strain. The increasing polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and rise of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman fears these factors could destabilise the democratic framework if they continue unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards traditional democratic values. Lichtman stressed the need for vigilance and resilience, urging those who cherish democratic principles not to lose hope. He reminded his audience that while democracy can be fragile, it can also be resilient—if people remain committed to protecting it.In the face of uncertainty, Lichtman’s insights remind us that, while no model is infallible, the continued pursuit of truth, transparency, and democratic values is indispensable. As he said, “Never give up hope.” It is a sentiment that transcends his prediction, offering a hopeful call to those committed to sustaining democracy in an unpredictable world.","American historian Allan Lichtman, often called the "" Nostradamus of US elections,"" found himself at a loss for words when his prediction of Kamala Harris’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections proved incorrect.

Unless of course he decides to become a dictator for more than just one day, a desire he has expressed, seemingly in jest. On a more serious note, Trump has said win or lose he will not run for office again, which means he will cede the Oval Office in 2028 when he will be 82.Typical of the American political system, analysts are already eyeing potential successors in 2028, with all eyes on incoming vice-president JD Vance, who is only 40, and will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the US government. The challenge for Vance to step into Trump formidable shoes will not only come from other aspirants in the party, but also from Trump's own proclivity to entrust his children, including his daughter Ivanka, 43, and sons Donald Trump Jr, 46, and Eric Trump, 40, with political responsibility. Vance’s Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri, will now be the official Second Lady of the United States.Beyond family and political succession though, the most influential member of the Trump II inner circle is expected to be Elon Musk, the Tesla/SpaceX honcho who threw his mouth and moolah behind the MAGA Supremo to counter the liberal leanings of the legacy media. Already assured of a key role in the TrumpII administration, Musk -- was embedded with the MAGA Supremo in Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on Tuesday night -- will be a lodestar in an incoming dispensation that has pledged to cull government departments and expenditure in the name of efficiency. Although Musk posted a meme showing him bringing a kitchen sink into the Oval Office as Trump’s victory became imminent, he cannot run for President because he is not a US born citizen. But beyond the man behind the Resolute Desk, he is expected to be the most influential figure in the Trump II dispensation.With the MAGA Supremo’s disdain for the Washington elite now well-established (resulting in at least 40 members of his cabinet and inner circle being fired or forced to resign), there will be plenty of new faces in Trump II White House, including those who unquestioningly stood by him or kissed his ring after being defeated by him. Among them Vivek Ramaswamy, 39, the Indian-American bio-science entrepreneur who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination but folded quickly to become a camp follower. Two other Indian-Americans, Kash Patel and Shalli Kumar, stood rock solid behind Trump through all his trials and tribulations, and they will be looking for the spoils of office too.Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN during Trump I, will also be looking to make a comeback after a late endorsement of Trump after critical comments about his campaign. Trump has also promised to let Robert Kennedy Jr, a man who has pushed crank science for decades, ""go wild"" with the health portfolio. Given that dozens of senior personnel in Trump I White House either resigned or were fired, there will be many new faces in Trump II, with everyone expected to toe the line in what will almost certainly be an imperial Presidency, a system endorsed by the US Supreme Court staffed by Trump during his first term.That will include the military commanders and the head of the US Federal Reserve and the Justice Department, who Trump expects to be pliable and follow the dictates of the White House. Having asserted that the President can do no wrong once – or anything he does is right since he has the mandate of the people once he is elected – Trump II is expected to be wild ride without guardrails.","Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution.

Although Harris won several Democratic strongholds, including Virginia and California, her campaign struggles to hold onto crucial votes, particularly in Black and Latino communities, where Trump's appeal has made inroads. Despite a loss of support in some demographics, Harris continues to focus on defending democracy, while Trump's campaign centers on issues like immigration and inflation.Trump's early success has also bolstered the Republican Party, which gained control of the Senate.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961506.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election.

In the end, it wasn’t close at all. Donald Trump swept all seven swing states , easily paving the way to the White House. Polls had suggested a neck-and-neck race, but Harris performed even worse than Joe Biden in every county. Trump's triumph signals the end of the liberal order established with Barack Obama’s presidency in 2008, which saw Democrats dominate the narrative and shape much of American culture, from the media to Hollywood. Now, with Donald Trump – a convicted felon who spent 40 minutes of a rally dancing to music and spent one discussing a golfer's junk – back in the White House, the tables have turned. Trump achieved numerous firsts, including becoming the first president since Grover Cleveland to serve non-consecutive terms and dismantling the so-called ""Blue Wall."" He also made deep in-roads with numerous minority voters, those who don't vote traditionally for Democrats.Planning a presidential campaign in just four months was a tall order, and Harris, stuck with Biden’s team , struggled to articulate her message. She was forced to reverse positions on key policies , including those on illegal immigration and gender-affirming care, which eroded public confidence.Initially, Harris refused interviews, leading polls by 3.6 points in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. Silicon Valley investor David Sacks warned she could fall into a “doom loop” : as her ratings dropped, she’d be forced to give more interviews, further harming her standing. This proved true, with her ratings plummeting from 3.6 to 1.4 points just before Election Day. In interview after interview, she failed to even articulate what she would do differently fromThe media's role should be to inform the public, yet, over the past eight years, mainstream outlets have been preoccupied with attacking Trump. They frequently distorted facts, as seen when they misinterpreted Trump’s comment about Liz Cheney claiming she threatened her with violence rather than critiquing her “war hawk” views . The MSM's reality distortation got to dissonant that a huge chunk of the country simply stopped believing anything they read. Even comedy shows leaned into anti-Trump narratives, reinforcing biases rather than fostering critical discourse. And they also committed the worst crime of all time, not even being funny. While the idea of journalistic neutrality was preposterous, the Trump Dergangement Syndrome meant that mainstream media simply left the field for people to use other media like X. Trump's victory would be an important moment for America's mainstream media to introspect the huge dissonance between reality and the reality they offer.With mainstream media missing the mark, alternative platforms have gained prominence, allowing people to judge Trump independently. Platforms like X, owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, and podcasts such as The Joe Rogan Experience have helped Trump redefine his image, distancing him from labels like “fascist” and “bigot.” In today’s media landscape, where figures like Joe Rogan hold as much influence as major celebrities, Trump’s alternative media appearances have countered the negative portrayals from traditional outlets and when people watched him speak for three hours on Rogan or with Andy Schulz on the Flagrant Podcast, they couldn't find the dictator or fascist that MSM had warned them about.As Harris’s ratings dipped, her surrogates grew desperate. Hillary Clinton likened a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi gathering, while Obama admonished Black men for not backing Harris. Over the years, the idea has gathered steam that the Dem party takes Black voters for granted, as evidenced by a Michael Joke on SNL where he joked: ""Without Black voters, the Democratic Party would be the Democratic Small Get Together."" Liz Cheney failed to convice moderates to vote for Harris, as did Barbara Bush. At the last moment, a plethora of celebrity endorsements made the Harris campaign look faux, particularly when Beyonce turned up and didn't perform or Cardi B forget her lines. Vance was a far more realiable VP pick than Walz, whose lack of national exposure was starkly contrasted against Vance in the only debate they went up against.On the the other hand, Team Trump this time was very carefully handpicked to buttress his weaker points. Trump, while a champion of retail politics, has always subpar on details. For that he had JD Vance, who left interviwers twisted after three hours with his smug logic. In Vivek Ramaswamy, Trump had a surrogate who not only countered his white supremacist stance but could debate a person without belittling them including crazy white evangelicals. RFK Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, Jungian archetypes who appeal to people on their own accord, meanwhile being former Dems who gave an insider's view on what went wrong with the party.Trump extended his reach to minority groups. His pro-business stance and ties with Indian PM Narendra Modi appealed to conservative Indian Americans. Among African Americans, he capitalised on frustrations with the Democratic Party, drawing young Black men with promises of economic opportunity. Endorsements from Arab American leaders in Michigan boosted his support, particularly among those critical of US involvement in the Middle East. His Hispanic support, though somewhat affected by a Puerto Rican joke, grew due to his positions on economic issues, immigration, and crime. And Dems forgot that the economy affects everyone including minorities. On the other hand, Harris' minority outreach appeared to be vacillating between different accents, trying to scare women about abortion and using crypto, loans and marijuana to reach out to Black men. This was evidenced by Harris getting fewer votes than Biden with every demographic. Kamala Harris ’s reluctance to commit to clear policy positions backfired. By avoiding firm stances on former progressive policies, she created an impression of evasiveness, which alienated voters. She was also seen as the ""No Comment"" candidate, one could win by not alienating voters. It was a rather hard sell though. For example, you can't claim to be the champion of recreational marijuana use when you have a history of locking up recreational marijuana users. In interview after interview, Harris was burdened by Biden's policy positions and failed to explain how her regime would be any different. Conversely, Trump’s direct, if polarising, policy positions won him a loyal base, securing a clear victory. Harris’s avoidance left her vulnerable to attacks, with voters gravitating toward a candidate with a more defined agenda.MAGA hasn't just cannibalised the Conservative movement, it has also challenged the Democratic Party’s liberal world order. Issues like the trans movement and identity politics have alienated some traditional Democratic voters, and MAGA has reframed debates on immigration as conflicts between illegal immigrants and minority communities. This was evidenced in Harris' own behaviour who left behind many of her more progressive policies to become a 'moderate'. For normal people, there is no hesistancy in saying that men shouldn't participate in women's sports or that grown men - irrespective of how they identity - shouldn't use bathrooms. Nor should children be allowed to transistion without their parent's consent. It was a hard task, getting women to vote for Harris after spending so long not being able to define a woman. The MAGA messaging on these issues hit home and this electoral reversal will perhaps force the Dems to come back to normal centre.Harris, much like Indian batsmen from the 90s, failed to deal with the swing. Of course, in Harris' case, it was the key swing states, losing ground that Joe Biden had previously held. Her failure to connect with working-class voters on issues like the economy and immigration cost her in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In Florida and Arizona, Harris’s appeal fell flat with Latino voters, who leaned towards Trump’s stances on jobs and border security. Her campaign’s missteps across these pivotal states led to a complete swing-state wipeout, blocking her path to victory.Kamala Harris’s ascension to the Democratic nomination had sparked criticism, with some labelling her a “DEI candidate” – suggesting her rise was due to diversity priorities over electoral support. This narrative cast doubt on her qualifications, overshadowing her roles as attorney general, senator, and vice president. Unlike Clinton - who powered through two bruising primaries - Harris was virtually given the nomination after Biden dropped out. VPs are often picked to complement the POTUS of the day. Becoming the main focus is a different matter. Republicans went out of their way to call her a DEI candidate, as they did for Tim Walz who they claimed was just their to counter Harris. Her campaign, burdened by these assumptions, ultimately failed to resonate widely, underscoring the unique challenges faced by Black women in leadership, where their achievements are often undermined by questions around race and gender.There’s an unspoken reality within American politics, underscored by historical and present-day facts. The US has longstanding issues with racism and misogyny. Abraham Lincoln had to lead the country into a civil war to end slavery. It wasn’t until 1920 that women gained the right to vote, and only in 1965 were voting rights fully extended to all Black citizens. Jim Crow laws continued to suppress Black rights across states well after the Civil War. The country has elected a Black president only once and has yet to see a female president. For many American voters, possibly including Black voters, casting a ballot for a candidate who is both half-Indian and half-Black felt like a great leap—regardless of the opponent. Even in 2024, it was a bridge too far for America to cross.","Donald Trump's victory signals the end of the liberal order established with Barack Obama’s presidency in 2008. The media's role should be to inform the public, yet, over the past eight years, mainstream outlets have been preoccupied with attacking Trump. The MSM's reality distortation got to dissonant that a huge chunk of the country simply stopped believing anything they read.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115039167,imgsize-641129,width-400,resizemode-4/115039167.jpg"

Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race.

based in Florida, has managed several significant . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race. Wiles is the daughter of Pat Summerall, the renowned football player and sportscaster. Summerall played in the NFL for ten years and went on to announce 16 Super Bowls before his passing in 2013.

She worked alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, with orchestrating the most disciplined and sophisticated campaign of Trump’s three presidential runs.

Her previous successes also include steering Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and a brief leadership role in Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential bid.

During the 1970s, she served in New York Representative Jack Kemp's Washington office. Subsequently, she took positions in Ronald Reagan's campaign and worked as a scheduler in his White House.

Later, she relocated to Florida, where she provided counsel to two Jacksonville mayors and worked alongside Representative Tillie Fowler.

Her career progressed into Florida's competitive political landscape, where she earned recognition for helping businessman Rick Scott secure the governorship.

Wiles earned widespread recognition both within and beyond Trump's close circle for orchestrating his most organised and effective campaign to date.

As the frontrunner for the position, she maintained a low profile, declining to speak during Trump's victory celebration in the early hours of Wednesday.

She strategically avoided the formal campaign manager title, considering Trump's previous history of making frequent changes in that role.

President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday appointed Susie Wiles , one of the two key campaign managers behind his election victory, as White House chief of staff . Wiles will make history as the first woman to serve in this role.This appointment marks the first in a series of expected staffing announcements as Trump prepares for his return to the White House on January 20.The US Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed her selection. ""The 45th and 47th President of the United States of America Donald J. Trump announced today that Susan Summerall Wiles, the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump's highly successful 2024 Campaign for President, will be named President Trump's White House Chief of Staff,"" Vance wrote in a post on X.During the campaign, Wiles demonstrated exceptional ability in managing Trump's behaviour, achieving this through earned respect and demonstrating the benefits of following her guidance rather than disregarding it.""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,"" Trump said in a statement.""It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,” he added.Trump's staff recognised Wiles' unique ability to work with his temperament and decision-making style whilst maintaining his authentic approach.During campaign events, Trump frequently acknowledged Wiles' contributions, highlighting what others had described to him as his ""best-run campaign.""""She's incredible. Incredible,"" he said at a Milwaukee rally earlier this month.Trump's first administration saw four chiefs of staff, including one serving in an acting capacity for a year, reflecting significant staff turnover. Several senior advisers were cast out in his first term, either due to Trump's resistance to management or because of ideological conflicts within the divided West Wing.This appointment represents Trump's initial significant decision as president-elect, potentially setting the tone for his incoming administration as he assembles the team to oversee federal government operations. Despite limited federal government experience, Wiles maintains a strong working relationship with the president-elect.The chief of staff position is ""absolutely critical to an effective White House,"" according to Chris Whipple, author of the book ""The Gatekeepers"", which examines how this role influences presidencies.""At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” Whipple said.""On the plus side, she's shown that she can manage Trump, that she works with him and can sometimes tell him hard truths, and that's really important. On the minus side, she really has no White House experience and hasn't really worked in Washington in 40 years. And that's a real disadvantage,” he added.","Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns.

The recent success of Republican Party and former President Donald Trump in the US elections is making waves in Canada, where right-wing leaders are challenging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's policies on immigration, climate change, and government spending.People's Party of Canada (PPC) leader Maxime Bernier has been one of Trudeau's loudest critics, calling for Canada to adopt a more conservative approach to avoid being ""outcompeted"" by the US.After Trump's victory, PPC chief Bernier issued a blistering critique of the Trudeau government.""Canada needs to cut government spending, cut taxes, cut excessive red tape, get rid of its costly and inefficient climate policy, abolish all its insane DEI programs, stop mass immigration, and create a business climate where workers, entrepreneurs, and investors can thrive. Or else we will be hopelessly outcompeted by the US, suffer a major brain drain, and see our standard of living drop,"" Bernier said.Bernier, a longtime critic of Trudeau’s immigration stance, has argued that high immigration levels contribute to rising gang-related violence in Canadian cities.He also condemned Trudeau and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre for their silence on violent incidents took place on November 3, involving supporters of the Khalistan separatist movement.""Not one of these cowards dares to even name the Khalistani Sikhs who are committing the violence. They're afraid to offend some voters, even though Khalistani supporters are a minority of Sikh Canadians. This complacency explains whyKhalistani extremism keeps growing in this country,"" he posted on X.When the Hindu Sabha Temple in Toronto was attacked earlier this month, Bernier was one of the few Canadian politicians to openly call out the perpetrators as Khalistani supporters. He had also targeted Trudeau and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh for not naming Khalistani elements.His firm stance on the matter has garnered praise from Canadian Hindu organisations, with the Hindu Forum Canada recently lauding Bernier for his willingness to confront extremism, even at political risk.""The silence of other leaders, who prioritise voter appeal over public safety, continues to enable the growth of radical ideologies that endanger our communities,"" the Hindu Forum Canada said in a statement.""As Canadians, we deserve leaders who denounce violence and hate without hesitation.

Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign ended with over $20 million in debt, highlighting financial strain following high spending and an aggressive ad strategy. Christopher Cadelago, California bureau chief for Politico, posted on X that Harris’s campaign ""ended with at least $20 million in debt,"" according to two sources familiar with the matter.This debt surfaced in the campaign’s final week, with Breitbart News noting that insiders attributed it partly to campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon’s decisions on high-profile concerts and intense ad campaigns.Harris's campaign reportedly attracted significant donations, raising over $1 billion, with $118 million still available as of mid-October. However, spending spiraled, leaving the campaign scrambling to address the deficit. “Jen [O’Malley Dillon] blew through a billion dollars in a few months,"" a campaign staffer told Breitbart News. Concerts featuring stars like Katy Perry, Lizzo, Eminem, and Bruce Springsteen were intended to energize young voters but proved costly.Despite massive spending, Harris’s team and Democratic allies channeled around $1.4 billion into political ads, outspending Trump and his allies by nearly $460 million, reported Fox Business. Yet, the spending didn’t secure key swing states, ultimately giving Trump an edge in a close race in Wisconsin.Data from AdImpact, an analytics firm, shows Harris’s focus on battleground states—Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, and Michigan—which absorbed nearly 80% of her ad spending. But outspending opponents in these states didn’t translate into wins; Trump’s narrow victories highlighted a gap between spending and voter influence.In Pennsylvania, for example, Harris outspent Trump by $261.9 million, yet Republicans held strong. Tax policy was the most discussed campaign issue, with Harris’s ads dominating airwaves on this topic—but it’s unclear if her messages connected with key voters.The breakdown of spending raises questions about the effectiveness of Harris’s strategy. Some critics point to a focus on star-studded events that failed to boost voter support. While the goal was to build excitement across a wide audience, some argue this approach led to financial strain without significant voter gains.Harris’s loss—and the resulting debt—may lead to a rethinking within the Democratic Party on campaign spending priorities, especially as Republicans achieved a historic win with fewer financial resources.","Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign ended with over $20 million in debt, highlighting financial strain following high spending and an aggressive ad strategy.

Climbing Florida's political ladder



A Pragmatic approach to Trump’s leadership style



Challenges ahead in West Wing



US President-elect Donald Trump in a historic move appointed Susie Wiles as the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. A veteran political strategist and key figure in Trump’s 2024 campaign, Wiles is widely known for her strategic expertise and her ability to navigate the complexities of Trump's political style.The selection was confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance , who described her as “the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump’s highly successful 2024 Campaign for President.”Wiles has deep roots in Republican politics, particularly in Florida, where she managed multiple successful campaigns. Known for steering Trump’s Florida efforts in both 2016 and 2020, she also contributed to the 2018 gubernatorial campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis . Her political career began in the 1970s in Washington, working in the office of New York Representative Jack Kemp, followed by roles in Ronald Reagan’s campaign and administration. She later transitioned to Florida politics, where she helped Rick Scott secure the governorship in 2010.Trump praised her as “tough, smart, innovative, and universally admired,” adding, “It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”Wiles’ success with Trump lies in her ability to balance his temperament while maintaining a disciplined campaign structure. She worked alongside co-manager Chris LaCivita to lead a more organised campaign than Trump’s previous runs. Known for her low-profile approach, Wiles avoided the spotlight, even refraining from speaking at Trump’s victory event.Her role as chief of staff will involve coordinating the president-elect’s agenda, managing personnel, and acting as a close advisor. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” said Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers. Whipple acknowledged her skill but noted her limited Washington experience as a possible disadvantage.Daughter of NFL legend Pat Summerall, launched her political career in Washington before establishing herself as a formidable strategist in Florida's high-stakes political landscape. She played a pivotal role in Rick Scott's successful 2010 gubernatorial bid and briefly worked on Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign.However, her relationship with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis grew tense, ultimately leading to a split. This division escalated during the 2024 primaries, where she led Donald Trump’s campaign against DeSantis.Wiles’ influence within Trump’s team reportedly fueled the campaign’s strategy, often using insider knowledge from her past work with DeSantis. After DeSantis suspended his presidential bid, Wiles posted a succinct farewell on social media: “Bye, bye.”Throughout the campaign, Trump’s aides, emboldened by Wiles’ insights, seized opportunities to mock DeSantis, targeting everything from his mannerisms to his footwear.Wiles’ pragmatic approach earned her Trump’s respect, allowing her to guide him without lecturing or reprimanding. During a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania, Wiles reportedly managed to communicate disapproval by standing nearby and staring in silence depicting her unique approach to managing Trump’s behaviour. Trump has publicly acknowledged her contributions, describing her leadership as “incredible” and calling her campaign management his “best-run campaign.”Wiles’ appointment signals a potential shift from Trump’s first term, where he experienced high turnover in the chief of staff role. Trump has remarked that he feels more prepared for his second term, having learned from past personnel decisions. While Wiles’ ability to balance discipline and Trump’s dynamic style has been effective, only time will tell if her role will bring more stability to the administration as she steps into one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.","US President-elect Donald Trump appoints Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff.

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden urged Americans Thursday to lower the political temperature after Donald Trump's crushing election win over Kamala Harris, saying in a conciliatory address to the nation that he would ensure a peaceful transition of power .In a solemn speech from the White House, Biden also said the result should ""lay to rest"" doubts about the integrity of the US election system fuelled by Trump's refusal to acknowledge his own 2020 defeat by the Democrat. ""Something I hope we can do, no matter who you voted for, is see each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans. Bring down the temperature,"" Biden said.Staff rose to their feet, cheered and clapped as Biden arrived in the famed Rose Garden. The 81-year-old dropped out of the race against Trump in July and handed the Democratic nomination to Harris, his vice-president. Biden said he had called Trump to congratulate him and assure him there would be a ""peaceful and orderly"" transition. Trump had refused to attend Biden's inauguration in 2021.The outgoing president also urged supporters not to lose hope after the re-election of Trump, who is likely to dismantle many of Biden's policies. ""Setbacks are unavoidable. Giving up is unforgivable. Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated,"" he said.Biden's comments were in stark contrast to billionaire Trump, whose election defeat denial four years ago culminated in the violent Jan 6, 2021 assault by Trump's supporters on the US Capitol.Biden has invited Trump to meet at the White House, for what would be their first encounter since Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in June that forced him out of the race.","US President Joe Biden urges Americans to lower the political temperature after Donald Trump's crushing election win.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the election result which saw Democrats decimated was partly the result of ""global headwinds"" that are going against all incumbent leaders around the world. “Despite all of the accomplishments that we were able to get done, there were global headwinds because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Jean-Pierre said.“And it had a political toll on many incumbents. If you look at what happened in 2024 globally. And that’s part of what you saw,” she added.Karine who faced many a heated press conference when Joe Biden was still in the race over Biden's health was asked whether Biden felt any responsibility for Harris' loss to Donald Trump or whether he regrets opting out of the race.Biden “believes he made the right decision when he decided to step aside,” Karine said without answering to the question of whether Biden felt any responsibility towards Harris' loss.“There’s going to be a lot of punditry, a lot of election experts who are going to have their opinions, who are going to have their thoughts, but the president is very, very proud of what he’s been able to accomplish and incredibly impressed with what the vice president was able to do,” Jean-Pierre said.Before the White House briefing, Joe Biden made his first address in which he said he accepts President-elect Donald Trump's victory and vowed to honor the Constitution with a peaceful transfer of power, even as he acknowledged the pain felt by his supporters.""I know for some people, it's a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it's a time of loss, campaigns or contests of competing visions,"" he said from the Rose Garden at the White House. ""The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made.""I've said many times you can't love your country only when you win,"" he added. ""Yesterday, I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory, and I assured him that I will direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition,"" Biden said.","Karine Jean-Pierre said the election result which saw Democrats decimated was partly the result of ""global headwinds"" that are going against all incumbent leaders around the world.
