Minor volcanic activity has been reported twice this month at Barren Island, India’s only active volcano, officials said on Monday.The eruptions occurred on September 13 and September 20 but were described as mild in nature, with no immediate threat to nearby areas, PTI reported.Located in the Andaman Sea, about 138 km northeast of Port Blair, Barren Island is South Asia's only active volcano.The remote island, spans roughly 3 sq km, is largely covered by volcanic cones and ash, with sparse vegetation visible from a distance. Rising 354 metres above sea level, it remains a striking geological feature of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.Barren Island has a recorded history of eruptions dating back to 1787. Since then, it has witnessed several episodes of activity, including significant eruptions in 2017 and 2022, the latest being in July this year.Officials continue to monitor the island closely, though the recent events have been classified as minor and pose no immediate risk to human settlements.","Minor volcanic activity reported twice this month at India's only active volcano.

Officials said the pace is expected to pick up in the coming days, with field timings fixed between 9am and 5pm.K A Dayanand, member-secretary of Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes (KSCBC), attributed the slow beginning to teething troubles. ""Today being Day 1, we expected a slow start, as enumerators had to download these applications and start using them. We will see more traction in the next couple of days,"" he told TOI.Complaints poured in from across the state about delays and glitches in the mobile application used for the exercise. Delays in receiving OTPs for Aadhaar authentication left many respondents impatient.""With enumerators having a larger area to cover, 150 houses per block and asking responses for 60 questions per household, a delay of 2-5 minutes in verifying credentials of respondents has become time-consuming,"" one enumerator said.In several cases, final submissions were not accepted by the software, while poor network connectivity in rural areas compounded the problem.In Bengaluru Urban and Dakshina Kannada districts, fieldwork did not start even by Monday. While officials cited incomplete training as a reason for delays in Bengaluru, confusion reigned in Dakshina Kannada, where enumerators doubling as booth-level officers were also burdened with Election Commission's forthcoming special intensive revision of voter lists.Teachers pressed into the survey raised concerns about downloading the app and securing uninterrupted mobile network. Chandrashekar Nugli, president of Primary School Teachers' Association, said, ""We expect these things to stabilize, with our teachers picking up pace from tomorrow.""Enumerators spoke of the hurdles they faced on Day 1. ""We collected the kit at Ron tahsildar's office. We could only download the app - KSBC Social and Educational Survey - by noon.

Top Maoist Commander Modem Balkrishna Among 10 Killed, 26 Arrested In Chhattisgarh

New Delhi: With the elimination of two more CPI (Maoist) central committee members - Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy alias Kosa and Katta Ramchandra Reddy alias Raju - by security forces on Monday in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district, the strength of the outfit's top decision-making body has shrunk by half in the current year, to just 10 members now.The neutralisation of the Maoists drew praise from home minister Amit Shah , who on X said, ""Our security forces are systematically dismantling the top naxal leadership, breaking the backbone of red terror"". The killings reflect the govt's and counter-Naxal forces's stand on dealing firmly with Maoists, notwithstanding the Sept 15 statement by CPI(Maoist) central committee member Mallojula Venugopal Rao alias Sonu, under the nom de guerre 'Abhay', offering to lay down arms and seeking a temporary halt to counter operations.Sonu's peace move has now been disowned by the CPI (Maoist) central committee, politburo, Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), in a joint statement dated Sept 20 as ""his individual decision"", not reflecting the view of the party that favours continuation of ""armed struggle"". Earlier, the Telangana state committee too had distanced itself from Sonu's statement.Stating that Sonu had cleverly misrepresented the May 7 opinion of then general secretary Basavaraju on laying down arms, the latest statement - also signed by 'Abhay', a generic name used by any CPI(Maoist) spokesperson - discloses that a subsequent discussion in the core group had led to a rethink, with the military wing, PLGA, and 'rebel cadre' being instructed to continue their armed struggle.The statement - the veracity of which is still being established though senior officers said it appears authentic - called the suggestion of Sonu to consult all CPI(Maoist) formations on talks an ""evil move to break the party"". ""Laying down arms and surrendering before the enemy means converting CPI(Maoist) from a revolutionary outfit to a revisionist outfit...Sonu has no right to digress from the basic line of the party,"" it said.Since Jan 19, 2025 - when central committee leader Chalapathi was neutralised in Gariaband, Chhattisgarh - his colleagues in the apex panel have fallen one after the other. Vivek Manjhi was eliminated in an encounter in Jharkhand on April 21, followed by the 'big kill' - that of general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju in Narayanpur on May 21. In June, Thentu Lakshmi alias Sudhakar was neutralised in Chhattisgarh and Gajarla Ravi in Andhra Pradesh. In Sept alone, four central committee members have been eliminated - Modem Balakrishnan alias Bhaskar on Sept 11 in Gariaband, Sahdev Soren on Sept 14 in Jharkhand, and on Monday, Kadari Reddy and Katta Reddy. Another central committee member Sujatha had surrendered before the Telangana Police this month.As of today, CPI(Maoist) has four surviving politburo members - general secretary Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji, Sonu, Ganapathy and Misir Besra - who are also in the central committee. The other 'active' central committee members are Pulluri Prasad Rao alias Chandranna, Ganesh Uikey, Anal Da, Malla Raji Reddy, Ramder and Madvi Hidma.","Two more CPI (Maoist) central committee members were eliminated by security forces on Monday in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district.

A joint team of security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation in Malhar area of Kathua district on Monday after the alleged sighting of two terror suspects in the area. Later in the day, GOC White Knight Corps (also known as 16 Corps) Lt Gen P K Mishra, accompanied by GOC CIF-Delta Maj Gen A P S Bal, visited Seoj Dhar to review the ongoing anti-terror operations in the hilly districts of Udhampur, Doda and Kishtwar in Jammu Division.The armed duo was allegedly spotted in Dragal village, in the upper reaches of Kathua, prompting fresh searches by a joint team of the Army, J&K Police and CRPF. Sniffer dogs and surveillance units were also pressed into service, officials said, adding that the suspects had not been traced so far, even as the operation continued.Massive searches have been underway in Seoj Dhar forest on the Dudu-Basantgarh axis in Udhampur, adjoining Doda’s Bhaderwah, over the weekend after a soldier fell to terrorists’ bullets late Friday, pushing this year’s security death toll in counter-terrorism operations in the region to 20 — 14 in Jammu and six in Kashmir. On Sunday, another gunfight erupted between security personnel and ultras in Keshwan forest, Kishtwar.While there was no contact with terrorists after the initial gunfights in Seoj Dhar and Keshwan, choppers and drones were maintaining aerial surveillance in the target areas while joint parties of the Army, J&K Police and CRPF were combing both forests, aided by sniffer dogs, officials said.","Joint team of security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation in Malhar area of Kathua district on Monday after the alleged sighting of two terror suspects in the area.

"Set to join Russia university, Uttarkhand man 'sent to war front in Ukraine'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/set-to-join-russia-university-uttarkhand-man-sent-to-war-front-in-ukraine/articleshow/124058700.cms,"'Killed, Captured, Destroyed': Russian Army Goes All-Out As Putin Holds Meetings In China

RUDRAPUR: A man from Udham Singh Nagar who had recently travelled to Russia for higher studies was allegedly coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine, his family said, adding they have had no contact with him since early Sept and are now desperate for help. The family of Rakesh Kumar, 30, has written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), sought support from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back home.Rakesh, a resident of Kushmoth village in Shaktifarm under Sitarganj tehsil, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa. However, within a few days, he began hinting at being in a troubling situation, suggesting things were not going as planned.His elder brother, Deepu Maurya, said the last time they had a direct conversation was on Aug 30, when Rakesh informed them that he had been forcibly drafted into the Russian army and would soon be deployed to the war zone in Ukraine. After that call, his phone went unreachable. The family later received a photo of Rakesh in a Russian military uniform, which only heightened their fears and confirmed their worst suspicions.A few days later, Rakesh called again, this time from an unfamiliar Russian number. In a short and distressed conversation, he told them that his passport and personal documents had been seized, his official emails had been deleted, and that he had undergone military training in the Donbas region before being sent to the battlefield. That was the last they heard from him.""We do not even know if he is alive. We just want the govt to bring him back home safely,"" said Deepu. The family wrote to MEA on Sept 5 and has also reached out to elected representatives and the local administration.This is not the first such case to surface in recent months. At least 20 Indian nationals - mostly from Punjab and Haryana - have claimed they were tricked into going to Russia on the pretext of education or employment, only to be coerced into joining Russian military.","Rakesh Kumar, 30, had recently travelled to Russia for higher studies.

SC notice to cops on bail plea of Umar & others,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-notice-to-cops-on-bail-plea-of-umar-others/articleshow/124058616.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday issued notice to Delhi Police on the bail plea of student activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider, Gulfisha Fatima and Shifa Ur Rehman in the Delhi riots larger conspiracy case, in which they face charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria sought Delhi Police's response and posted hearing on October 7. Counsel for the accused sought interim bail at the earliest, saying they had been in jail for five years.Student activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider, Gulfisha Fatima and Shifa Ur Rehman, facing charges under UAPA in the Delhi riots larger conspiracy case, cited SC's earlier ruling to seek bail as they have been in jail for five years and there is no likelihood of the trial concluding within reasonable time.Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal told the bench that it was a shocking case where students are in jail for more than five years and urged that the court should first grant them interim bail. The bench, however, said it would hear and decide finally the main petition.Sibal further submitted that an early date be given in the case and pressed for early listing. ""Before Diwali, so that they can be out by Diwali.They are all there for more than five years,"" he said. Accepting his request, the court posted the case to Oct 7.All the petitioners have raised similar grounds to get bail and invoked the apex court's earlier ruling. ""It is humbly submitted that on consideration of the long duration of incarceration as well as the bail restricting provision of several other special Acts, it has been consistently laid down by this court in a plethora of judgments that in cases where there is no likelihood of conclusion of trial within a reasonable time, the rigors of statutory restrictions should melt down and the constitutional courts should weigh in favour of granting bail in such matters,"" said the petition filed by Imam.They said that materials or overt acts as alleged by police are extremely weak and flimsy, warranting interference by this court. Referring to SC's last year verdict in the 'Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh vs State of Maharashtra' case on grant of bail in UAPA cases, they said over-arching postulate of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty cannot be brushed aside lightly, howsoever stringent the penal law may be.""If the state or any prosecuting agency, including the court concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution then the state or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. The article of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime,"" the court had said in its verdict.It had further held that the presence of statutory restrictions like Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA per se does not oust the ability of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of Part-III of the Constitution (pertaining to fundamental rights).The accused approached SC, challenging a Delhi HC order which denied bail to the activists and four others. Rejecting their bail plea, HC had said that any ""conspiratorial violence"" under the guise of freedom of speech of citizens could not be allowed. ""Such actions must be regulated and checked by the state machinery as they do not fall within the ambit of freedom of speech, expression and association,"" an HC bench of Justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur had said.Besides the activits, the others who were denied bail include Mohd Saleem Khan, Athar Khan, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Shadab Ahmed. The bail plea of another accused, Tasleem Ahmed, was rejected by a different HC bench on Sept 2.","Student activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider, Gulfisha Fatima and Shifa Ur Rehman, face charges under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

""Charlie's murder was not just an attack on one man or one movement. It was an attack on our entire nation.""

“dear friend,”

""a level of heartache”

A public memorial for Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, that was held at State Farm Stadium was intended as a solemn honor. Yet, there were moments that overshadowed the proceedings. They transformed a day of mourning into a subject of intense online debate. Many critics are now openly questioning the theatricality of this event, especially the dramatic entrance of Erika Kirk, the grieving widow of Charlie. Their comments on X are now overshadowing the intended purpose of the event, prompting questions online between spectacle and tribute.The spectacle that was part of Erika Kirks’ walk to the podium, accompanied by someimmediately ignited a firestorm on X.

A user claimed,A few users didn’t stop at Erika. They even started to talk about how cheap fireworks being used there were symbolic of the event being sponsored by WWE. The comment on X read,Despite the event being a success, the online critics seem not to shut up with their comments and comparisons.Their sentiments have been similar, arguing about the scale of the event and suggesting this was some significant pre-production.The service in itself was quite a significant event. It drew 10s of 1000s of people to the 63,000-seat State Farm Stadium, located in Glendale, Arizona. The atmosphere therein, reportedly, has been a mix of political rally and mourning, with a very tight level of TSA-level security in the place. Some prominent conservative figures even delivered eulogies, trying to frame Kirk’s death as an attack on the nation.President Donald Trump also gave a strong political speech. He stated,Even Vice President JD Vance didn’t stay behind, as he remembered Kirk as hiswho, as per him, treated all with grace.

"Watch: Copenhagen, Oslo Airport shut after unidentified drones sighted; more than 40 flights cancelled & 40 diverted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-copenhagen-airport-shut-after-unidentified-drones-sighted-more-than-40-flights-cancelled-and-40-diverted/articleshow/124059021.cms,"



Major airports in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway, faced flight disruptions on Monday and early Tuesday after multiple drones were spotted near the airspace, forcing temporary closures and diverting dozens of flights.Copenhagen Airport was closed around 8:30 pm local time after two to three “unidentified” drones were observed in the area, an airport spokesperson said. “No aircraft can take off or land at the airport, and as a result, several flights are being diverted to other airports. The police are investigating the matter, and we currently have no timeline for reopening,” airport spokeswoman Lise Agerley Kurstein told AFP.As of late Monday night, aviation tracking website Flightradar24 reported more than 50 flights diverted. Some incoming flights were rerouted to other airports in Denmark, while others were sent to Gothenburg and Malmö in Sweden. The airport reopened around 12:20 am local time (6:20 pm ET) but delays and cancellations continued into Tuesday.Copenhagen police duty officer Anette Ostenfeldt told AFP that “three or four big drones” were still flying over the airport.“They are still flying back and forth, coming and going,” she said, adding, “But they are bigger than what you as a private individual can buy.”In Oslo, the airspace over the airport was temporarily closed Tuesday morning following another drone sighting. “This means that incoming flights are now being redirected to the nearest airport,” Communication Manager Monica Iren Fasting told CNN. Police said two foreign nationals were arrested for flying drones over a restricted area near Akershus Fortress, although there was no indication the incident was linked to Copenhagen.European authorities have been on high alert after Russian drones violated Polish and Romanian airspace earlier this month, prompting Nato allies to strengthen eastern defenses. There is currently no evidence that Monday’s drone activity in Denmark or Norway is connected to those incidents.The disruption comes after a weekend of travel issues at major European airports, including a cyberattack affecting check-in systems. Drone sightings have previously caused major chaos in Europe, such as at Gatwick Airport near London in 2018, where repeated drone activity stranded tens of thousands of passengers and disrupted hundreds of flights.","Copenhagen Airport was closed around 8:30 pm local time Monday.

NEW DELHI: Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday said that Moscow will adhere to the nuclear warhead agreement with US for one more year as it sets to expire in February next year.Putin, in a televised meeting, said that the termination of the 2010 New START would have negative consequences for global stability.""Russia is prepared to continue adhering to the central quantitative limitations of the New START Treaty for one year after February 5, 2026,"" Putin said.Speaking at a meeting with members of Russia’s Security Council, he said that Russia would expect the US to follow Moscow’s example and also stick to the treaty’s limits.The New START, signed by then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.Its looming expiration and the lack of dialogue on anchoring a successor deal have worried arms control advocates.The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance, but they have been dormant since 2020.In February 2023, Putin suspended Moscow’s participation in the treaty, saying Russia could not allow US inspections of its nuclear sites at a time when Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Moscow’s defeat in Ukraine as their goal.Moscow has emphsised, however, that it wasn’t withdrawing from the pact altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the treaty set.","Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Moscow will adhere to the nuclear warhead agreement with US for one more year.

'Please don't go out casually': China alerts citizens



Government work suspended in Philippines



Daily life disrupted in Taiwan







Super Typhoon Ragasa slammed into the southern part of China, prompting complete shutdown of schools and businesses in at least 10 cities along with flight cancellations on Tuesday.This came a day after it prompted the evacuation of thousands from northern Philippine villages and led to the closure of schools and offices in the Philippines and neighboring Taiwan, as it threatened flooding and landslides.It is expected to stay over the South China Sea at least until Wednesday, passing south of Taiwan and Hong Kong before making landfall on the Chinese mainland.Chinese authorities alerted the citizens about the typhoon and urged them not to go out ""casually.""""Except for emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people's livelihood, please do not go out casually,"" AFP quoted Shenzhen emergency authority saying.In Shenzhen, around 4,00,000 residents, particularly those in low-lying and flood-prone areas, were set to be relocated, while the city’s airport announced it would stop operations beginning Tuesday night.Locally known as Nando, the typhoon caused widespread disruption across northern Philippines as it slammed into Panuitan island off Cagayan province with sustained winds of 215 kph (134 mph) and gusts up to 295 kph (183 mph).Thousands of people were evacuated from villages, while over 8,200 residents in Cagayan and 1,220 in Apayao were moved to emergency shelters. Power outages were reported on Calayan island and throughout Apayao, and domestic flights and inter-island ferries were suspended due to rough seas.Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also suspended government work and classes in Manila and 29 northern provinces to ensure public safety.In Taiwan, Ragasa prompted authorities in southern Taitung and Pingtung counties to close schools and offices in coastal and mountainous areas, as well as on Orchid and Green islands.Ferry services to outlying islands were suspended, and afternoon flights were canceled to protect passengers from the typhoon’s severe winds and rough seas. Residents were advised to remain indoors and take precautionary measures against potential flooding and landslides.Strong winds and torrential rains brought by Ragasa disrupted daily life and transport across the affected regions. Coastal communities were warned of the risk of storm surges, and local officials coordinated emergency measures to safeguard lives and property.","Super Typhoon Ragasa slammed into the southern part of China, prompting complete shutdown of schools and businesses in at least 10 cities.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

MANILA: More than 10,000 evacuees sheltered in schools and evacuation centres in the Philippines on Monday as heavy rains and gale-force winds from Super Typhoon Ragasa lashed the country's far north.The typhoon, which is gaining strength as it proceeds on a collision course with southern China, was expected to make landfall over the Philippines' Babuyan Islands around midday.The sparsely populated islands lie about 740 kilometres (460 miles) south of Taiwan, where smaller-scale evacuations were also underway.As of 11:00 am (0300 GMT), maximum sustained winds of 215 kilometres per hour were reported at the storm's center, with gusts reaching up to 265 kph as it moved westward towards the Babuyans, the national weather service said.""I woke up because of the strong wind.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

D4vd’s subreddit locked: Singer accused of moderating posts on Celeste Rivas’s death; fans claim critical posts deleted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/d4vds-subreddit-locked-singer-accused-of-moderating-posts-on-celeste-rivass-death-fans-claim-critical-posts-deleted/articleshow/124060426.cms,"



Singer D4vd is facing online backlash after Redditors accused him of moderating his own subreddit and allegedly deleting posts critical of him amid the police investigation into the death of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas, Fox11 reported.Users noticed unusual activity on the subreddit, claiming posts raising concerns about the case and the singer’s lyrics were removed. Because D4vd was listed as the sole moderator, Redditors accused him of controlling the narrative to portray himself positively.Hours later, the subreddit was locked, preventing users from posting. Many alleged that D4vd left the subreddit entirely, which disables further posts unless members request to join. Currently, no one is listed on the moderator list.The controversy follows a statement by someone claiming to moderate D4vd’s Discord server and Twitch channel, who said they were unaware of Rivas’ true age or that she was a missing person. “Based on what was shared in D4vd's Twitch streams and from Rivas' role in the Discord server, we believed she was around 18 or 19 years old,” the moderator said. The individual added that they had minimal contact with D4vd or his management.TMZ noted that the moderator is not employed by Twitch and the statement was not on behalf of the platform.The case centers on the discovery of Rivas’ dismembered remains on September 8 in D4vd’s Tesla, a day after her 15th birthday. Police said the body was found wrapped in a bag inside the vehicle’s trunk after employees at Hollywood Tow reported a strong odor. Rivas had been reported missing on April 5, 2024, from Lake Elsinore.Following the discovery, D4vd canceled his world tour shows, including a Seattle performance. He has been cooperating with authorities and a search warrant executed at a Hollywood Hills home linked to him resulted in the seizure of a computer and other evidence. LAPD has not named D4vd a suspect, and the exact circumstances of Rivas’ death remain unclear.D4vd was recently dropped by brands Crocs and Hollister following his connection to the investigation. Authorities continue to probe the case, and no official link has been established between the singer’s music and the teen’s death.","Singer D4vd is facing online backlash after Redditors accused him of moderating his own subreddit and allegedly deleting posts critical of him.

The science: Mixed and inconclusive



Autism, vaccines and politics



What autism research really shows



Dr Trump?







US President Donald Trump has reignited controversy in the medical community by urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol over an alleged link to autism, despite the absence of scientific consensus. Speaking at a White House event on Monday, he called on mothers-to-be to “tough it out” rather than take acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, and raised doubts over standard childhood vaccines.His remarks drew swift condemnation from doctors, medical groups and researchers, who warned that the advice could frighten pregnant women, undermine confidence in vaccines, and push people towards unsafe decisions.Trump, who has long entertained fringe health theories, pressed his case in increasingly urgent tones, declaring: “Taking Tylenol is not good” and urging pregnant women to “fight like hell not to take it.” He added that only an “extremely high fever” could justify its use.Medical organisations quickly pushed back. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has long cited acetaminophen as one of the safest painkillers during pregnancy.Its president, Dr Steven Fleischman, warned that Trump’s claims would terrify mothers-to-be. “I don't want you going back and looking and saying to yourself, ‘I shouldn’t have done this, I shouldn't have done that.’ It's nothing you did. It really is not,” he told news agency AP. “Not treating the fever probably has more adverse effects that you need to worry about than taking the medication.”Acetaminophen—known in the UK as paracetamol—is a widely used pain reliever and fever reducer, found in many over-the-counter and prescription medicines.It works by raising the body’s pain threshold, helping relieve minor aches and pains, and by lowering fever through aiding heat loss. Common uses include treating headaches, backaches, arthritis, toothache, muscle aches, and period pain.Some studies have suggested a possible association between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A Mount Sinai-led review published in BMC Environmental Health this year examined 46 studies covering more than 100,000 participants. It concluded that “higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link” and warned that “even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications. ” Researchers stressed that acetaminophen can cross the placental barrier and may interfere with foetal brain development through oxidative stress or hormonal disruption.“Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors,” said Dr Didier Prada of Mount Sinai. “Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. Our study highlights the importance of discussing the safest approach with health care providers.”Another large-scale analysis, however, painted a very different picture. A Swedish cohort study of 2.48 million children published in JAMA found no evidence that acetaminophen use in pregnancy was associated with autism, ADHD or intellectual disability once sibling-controlled analyses were applied. The authors concluded that earlier findings may have been influenced by “familial confounding” rather than a direct causal link.The US Food and Drug Administration struck a cautious tone, advising physicians that “a causal relationship has not been established” and noting the presence of contrary evidence in the scientific literature. Tylenol maker Kenvue defended the drug, saying: “We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.”Trump’s remarks did not stop at Tylenol. He repeated talking points long associated with the anti-vaccine movement, raising doubts about the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot and calling for delays to hepatitis B vaccination in newborns. “Don’t let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you’ve ever seen in your life,” he said, before dramatically likening paediatric vaccines to doses “pumping into a horse. ”Medical experts have long debunked any connection between vaccines and autism. “Studies have repeatedly found no credible link between life-saving childhood vaccines and autism,” said Dr Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She warned that “any effort to misrepresent sound, strong science poses a threat to the health of children.”Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has spent decades pushing theories about vaccines and autism, stood alongside Trump. Kennedy promoted leucovorin, a folate-based drug already used for chemotherapy side effects, as an “exciting therapy” for some children with autism. The FDA confirmed it had approved the tablet form for children with cerebral folate deficiency but emphasised that evidence for autism treatment remains preliminary.According to the Associated Press, autism is a developmental condition rooted largely in genetics. Hundreds of genes have been linked to the disorder, with environmental factors such as parental age, preterm birth or maternal infections during pregnancy also playing a role. Rates of diagnosis have risen sharply over the past two decades — from 1 in 150 children in the early 2000s to about 1 in 31 today — largely because of broader definitions, improved screening and greater awareness.“There is no single cause,” said Boston University expert Helen Tager-Flusberg. “Different combinations of genes and other factors can all affect how a foetal brain develops.”That complexity underscores why Trump’s simplistic linkage between Tylenol, vaccines and autism struck many scientists as reckless. As Dr Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia put it: “No doubt children will suffer” from such claims.The presentation echoed Trump's briefings during the Covid-19 pandemic, when President Trump revisited debunked medical claims with familiar bravado.“I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning?” Trump asked in April 2020. “As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”Despite acknowledging, “I’m just making these statements from me,” Trump claimed he'd consulted “many doctors.” Scientists condemned the event, calling it misinformation-laden and dangerous.","US President Donald Trump has reignited controversy by urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol over an alleged link to autism. His remarks drew swift condemnation from doctors, medical groups and researchers, who warned that the advice could frighten pregnant women. He also raised doubts over standard childhood vaccines.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124059597,imgsize-940604,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image-generated-using-chatgpt.jpg"
Charlie Kirk assassination: Donald Trump signs order labelling Antifa as ‘domestic terrorist organisation’; legality in question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-assassination-donald-trump-signs-order-labelling-antifa-as-domestic-terrorist-organisation-legality-in-question/articleshow/124059000.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating Antifa as a “domestic terrorist organisation”, a move that immediately raised questions over its legality and enforcement.The order came in the wake of the assassination of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, although officials have not established a link between the suspect and the left-wing movement, as per BBC.The White House fact sheet argued that Antifa “has a long history of terrorising our communities,” citing incidents involving violence against law enforcement and pro-Trump events.Trump’s order directs all federal agencies to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations” linked to Antifa or its supporters, according to CBS News.On his Truth Social platform, Trump called the group a “sick, dangerous, radical left disaster” and pledged that it would be “thoroughly investigated”.Antifa — short for anti-fascist — is not a formal organisation but a decentralised movement of loosely affiliated activists opposing neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other far-right groups.The Congressional Research Service has described it as “independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals” lacking a central leadership structure or shared ideology, as per news agency AP.According to scholars, its activists range from anarchists and communists to hardline socialists, and some cells have engaged in violent confrontations. University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney was quoted by CBS News as saying, “There’s tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.”Trump has long targeted Antifa, previously blaming it for unrest during protests in his first term, particularly after the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Then-Attorney General William Barr at the time also cited “antifa-like tactics” by agitators during demonstrations.Trump revived the designation push after Kirk’s killing on September 10, saying in the Oval Office last week that he would pursue a domestic terrorism label if it had the support of his Cabinet.Legal experts stress, however, that the US president does not have statutory authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organisations. “You can’t prosecute an ideology,” said Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, as cited by CBS News.While foreign terrorist organisations can be formally listed, no equivalent domestic mechanism exists due to First Amendment protections. Analysts note the administration may instead prioritise Antifa-related cases within federal law enforcement, according to AP.The suspect in Kirk’s killing, Tyler Robinson, has been described by authorities as having developed a “leftist ideology” and resentment of Kirk’s views. But investigators have not presented evidence linking Robinson to Antifa.Antifa’s roots trace back to US anti-fascist groups confronting neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, with the term itself deriving from the German “antifaschistisch.” It became more visible after Trump’s election in 2016 and the violent clashes in Charlottesville in 2017, where its activists opposed far-right demonstrators.Despite the executive order, experts say the designation is largely symbolic. Without a legal framework to enforce it, the move may serve more as a political signal of Trump’s campaign against what he calls “radical left” violence rather than a measure with immediate legal effect.","US President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating Antifa as a ‘domestic terrorist organisation’ The order came in the wake of the assassination of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, although officials have not established a link between the suspect and the left-wing movement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124059012,imgsize-909030,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-63.jpg"
Donald Trump Florida assassination case: Man accused of trying to kill US President rests case without testifying; closing arguments set for Tuesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-florida-assassination-case-man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-us-president-rests-case-without-testifying-closing-arguments-set-for-tuesday/articleshow/124058863.cms,"



Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year, rested his case on Monday without taking the witness stand. Representing himself, Routh concluded his defense after questioning a firearms expert and two character witnesses.US District Judge Aileen Cannon asked whether he wished to testify, to which Routh replied, ""I will not testify."" Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday morning, followed by jury deliberations.Prosecutors allege that Routh spent weeks plotting the attack before aiming a rifle from behind shrubbery at Trump on September 15, 2024, at the Mar-a-Lago Club in West Palm Beach. A Secret Service agent testified he spotted Routh before Trump came into view, prompting the agent to open fire and forcing Routh to drop his weapon and flee.On Monday, firearms expert and former US Marines sniper Michael McClay testified that Routh’s hiding spot provided ""observation of the Hole 6 green."" He confirmed the rifle worked during testing but noted the second round jammed, raising doubts about its ability to fire multiple shots. He also said the scope recovered from the scene was improperly mounted.The two character witnesses described Routh as a peaceful man, though both admitted under cross-examination they had not seen him in years.Routh has pleaded not guilty to attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms violations. Prosecutors rested their case Friday after presenting testimony from 38 witnesses over seven days.Judge Cannon had initially set aside three weeks for the trial, but Routh’s short cross-examinations and limited defense presentation have sped up proceedings.The Florida case comes weeks after Trump survived an earlier assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, where a gunman fired eight shots, grazing Trump’s ear before being killed by Secret Service.Routh, a former North Carolina construction worker who later moved to Hawaii, has a history of brushes with law enforcement. He previously faced charges for weapons possession, stolen property, and attempts to recruit fighters for conflicts overseas. He has also pleaded not guilty to separate state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.","Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year, rested his case on Monday.

US President Donald Trump on Monday cautioned pregnant individuals against using Tylenol, citing an unsubstantiated link to autism, while also advocating for major changes to standard infant vaccination schedules.The White House’s push to reshape healthcare in the United States has sparked concern among medical and scientific professionals over the administration’s proposals.Healthcare practitioners have long endorsed acetaminophen as one of the safest pain relief options during pregnancy, noting that untreated fever and pain can pose risks to both mother and foetus.Trump stated firmly, “Taking Tylenol is not good.” “For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary. That's for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out,” he added.At the press conference, Trump also proposed significant changes to infant vaccination schedules, claiming without evidence that vaccinating newborns against Hepatitis B—a severe and highly infectious disease—is unnecessary.Echoing anti-vaccination rhetoric, Trump said, “I would say, wait until the baby is 12 years old and formed.”Medical experts warn that this contradicts decades of evidence showing that newborn vaccination within 24 hours of birth is essential to prevent maternal transmission of Hepatitis B, a liver-damaging and potentially carcinogenic disease.The announcement followed a recent meeting of a special advisory panel appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which refrained from endorsing a one-month delay for the initial Hepatitis B vaccination. The panel’s decision to continue discussions provided temporary reassurance to public health experts concerned about the consequences of postponing the vaccine.In a related move, the US pharmaceutical regulator approved the drug leucovorin for the treatment of autism.The Food and Drug Administration said in the US Federal Register that it had approved leucovorin, a concentrated form of folic acid. Folic acid is commonly given to expectant mothers to support healthy fetal development.Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the administration’s controversial health chief, has promoted leucovorin as an “exciting therapy” for children with autism, though experts caution that its efficacy for autism remains under investigation.","US President Donald Trump on Monday cautioned pregnant individuals against using Tylenol, citing an unsubstantiated link to autism.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Relief in Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood. But for the millions already uprooted, the crisis has only just begun.","Nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.

DHAKA: ""Domestic and foreign forces"" were involved in the last year uprising against former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, and with their backing, Muhammad Yunus was offered the post of interim govt chief, her lawyer claimed in the International Crimes Tribunal on Sunday, as it tries her in cases of ""crimes against humanity"".Hasina did not resign from office but was compelled to ""leave for India"" last year following the mass uprising against her govt, said state-appointed defence counsel Md Amir Hossain, who is also representing former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal.

A British couple, who were detained in Afghanistan earlier this year, have been freed after the Qatari-mediated negotiations.Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March, AP reported.The couple have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, running “Rebuild,” an organisation providing education and training programmes. Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Nepal’s deposed prime minister K P Sharma Oli has denied that his government ordered security forces to open fire during the September 8 “Gen Z” protests that left at least 19 people dead.“The government didn’t order to shoot at the demonstrators,” the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) chairman said in a Constitution Day message on Friday. “The bullets were fired at the protesters from automatic guns, which were not possessed by the police personnel, and this must be investigated upon.”Oli alleged that “infiltrating conspirators” had turned the peaceful demonstrations violent. “The infiltrating conspirators turned the agitation violent, and this way our youths were killed,” he said, while demanding a formal inquiry into the incident.The two-day protests against alleged corruption and a ban on social media left at least 72 people dead, including three policemen. Oli resigned on September 9, a day after hundreds of protesters stormed his office demanding accountability for the deaths.In a Facebook post, Oli also pointed to the arson attacks that followed his resignation, claiming that government buildings, the Supreme Court, and Nepal’s national map were set ablaze. “I don’t want to elaborate on the conspiracies behind these incidents, time will speak for itself,” he added.Recalling the challenges Nepal faced during the promulgation of its Constitution, Oli urged unity across generations. “All generations of Nepalis must unite, to confront the assault on our sovereignty and to defend our Constitution,” he said.","Deposed PM KP Oli denies that his government ordered security forces to open fire during the September 8 protests.

Read full post:



Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.
