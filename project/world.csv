There was a scooty and a car while we were turning right... The car slightly touched the other vehicle and the airbag opened suddenly, our vision was hampered and the car went out of control. We were going at 50 km/hour,” Chaurasia said.“There were no people at that time, just a scooter and a car. I had no idea. I did not do any party, I went for Holika Dahan and was not drunk... Today, I was told that one woman has died and a few have sustained injuries.

Two ‘ forest watchers ’ at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh have been arrested and booked under UAPA for alleged ties with Maoists, triggering unrest among forest staff. Many are seeking transfer for fear of getting caught between Maoists and police.‘Watchers’ are the ones who patrol the forest on foot, venturing into the deepest, most dangerous parts of the forest that others dare not. “Hamare logon ko tiger se dar nahi lagta saheb, police se lagta hai (We are more scared of police than tigers),” said a forest officer, expressing anguish over the arrest of two forest watchers.This has not only raised concerns about the infiltration of insurgent sympathizers within state’s wildlife sanctuaries, but left ground-level forest staff shaken.Ashok Kumar Lal and Santosh Kumar Lal, both 28 and from Mandla district, were arrested during a Maoist encounter on Sunday evening in which an insurgent was killed, said police.“Both of them were good patrol guards, always vigilant. What are they supposed to do? Maoists threaten to kill their families if they don’t help them and if they do, police arrest them for siding with anti-nationals. Watchers play a very important role in tiger conservation. They are indispensable as they patrol several hectares of dense forest on foot and unarmed,” said the forest officer, requesting not to be named.Mandla district police say the duo was caught ‘signalling’ information to Maoists on movement of security forces. From atop a hillock, they would whistle in a certain way or strike stones together as per a prearranged code to warn Maoists, say police.Forest officers maintain the duo was indeed ‘signalling’ to Maoists — but to collect their food and ration. “They were not signalling Maoists about movement of forces. It’s a wrong perception,” said the officer.“Forest watchers are in a Catch-22 situation, trapped between the threat of Maoists and police action. If they cooperate with Maoists to avoid retaliation, they risk arrest by police. If they refuse, they face violence from insurgents or suspicion from law enforcement,” said another forest officer.“Registration of cases under serious sections like UAPA against our people without analysing the situation is uncalled for,” he added. Insiders say that other forest watchers and field staff are now reluctant to work.Though Ashok and Santosh claimed it was their first interaction with Maoists, investigators say they have found handwritten notes and other evidence suggesting a much deeper connection with the insurgents. The two were not passive observers — they provided vital intelligence to Maoists about security force movements and facilitated supply of essential materials, say officers.Stationed in the heart of Kanha, the forest watchers held a strategic position to aid Maoists, allege police, pointing out that they not only compromised national security and endangered conservation efforts, but also dragged their colleagues under a cloud of suspicion as police now wonder how deeply Maoist sympathizers may have infiltrated sensitive areas.Kanha, one of India’s most iconic tiger reserves, is a symbol of conservation success. Moist movement has been reported in around 40% of the core area of Kanha, in areas bordering Balaghat. “We are now battling the expanding presence of Maoists within these protected zones. There are a joint camps of forest and police near Mukki in Kanha. Khatia has no such camp,” said a police officer.","Two ‘ forest watchers’ at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh have been arrested and booked under UAPA.

Grimes says she's begging Elon Musk to not make their son X's life public: 'No way to deal with this',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/grimes-says-shes-begging-elon-musk-to-not-make-their-son-xs-life-public-no-way-to-deal-with-this/articleshow/119017061.cms,"Elon Musk's son X's latest public outing was when Donald Trump bought a Tesla from his father.

Grimes' fresh concern is over an old fake post

Grimes once again expressed her disapproval of her son X having a public life, courtesy to his father Elon Musk who takes the four-year-old along with him almost everywhere he goes. Last, X was seen outside the White House as Elon Musk was showing Tesla cars to President Donald Trump before he purchased one. X was in front of the camera as Elon Musk stood beside the president when Trump took questions from reporters.This is not the first time that Elon Musk's ex and X's mother made it clear how she feels about her son getting so much exposure all of a sudden. When X was all over the Oval Office when his father joined Donald Trump in a press conference, Grimes said he should not be public like this. But despite what she feels about it, X is now a public figure and mostly remains perched on his father's shoulders -- as he's becoming camera-friendly showing his antics to his audience.Grimes' fresh concern, however, stemmed from an old fake post. The fake post made it look as if Grimes was spilling some secrets about Elon Musk's sex life --- without naming him. ""Sexuality and kinks are simply different for everyone. many Fortune 500 CEOs enjoy being pegged,"" the fake post of Grimes said.As Grimes commented on the fake post again clarifying that she never actually made any such post, a social media user asked her how to protect the children from such internet filth.""I unfortunately do not control the internet and cannot wipe this from the internet,"" Grimes said.""I have tried begging the public and my kids dad to keep them offline, and I've tried legal recourse.

Two payments made in a gap of an hour

'The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK'

20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student, who went missing from her holiday in the Dominican Republic made two payments on the Venmo app which offers the investigators fresh clues. The disappearance was initially thought to be a case of drowning but Konanki's parents insisted that the search for her should be widened and now the police are probing the angle of a foul play as well. Joshua Riibe, the last person seen with Konanki, claimed he pulled her from drowning in the rough waters of the sea but could not tell police what happened after.The first payment was made at 2.54 pm on March 5 to an unnamed new user. Konanki used a sailboat emoji to describe it. The second was made at 3.38 pm and the description was Coco Bongo which is a renowned nightclub in Punta Canda. This second payment was to Ananya Chilakamarai, one of Konanki's friends on the trip.Joshua Riibe said he had tequila shots with his friends and waded into the ocean with Konanki and was swept away. He said he fought the waves and reached the shore with Konanki but then slept off. “The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her answer because I started vomiting all the seawater I'd swallowed. After vomiting, I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she'd grabbed her things and left. I felt really bad and tired. I lay down on a beach chair and fell asleep because I couldn't go far. Then I woke up because of the sun and mosquito bites. I went to my friend's room to get my phone, and then I went to my room to sleep,” he said.Riibe said he met Konanki when he and his friend introduced themselves to her and her friends. He admitted that they were kissing in the water when a wave crashed into them.“It took a long time to get her out; it was difficult. I was a lifeguard in a pool, not in the ocean. I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water. I could have lost consciousness several times,” he continued. “When I finally reached the ground on the beach, I pulled her in front of me. Then she went to gather her belongings, since the sea had moved us. She wasn't out of the water, as it was up to our knees. She was walking at an angle in the water.”After that, he said he never saw her. “My friend asked me if I knew where the girl was. I told him I thought she had gone to her room, and he told me she never returned,” he said.","20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student, who went missing from her holiday in the Dominican Republic made two payments on the Venmo app. The disappearance was initially thought to be a case of drowning but now the police are probing the angle of a foul play.

US Canada: New rule for Canadians staying in the US for over 30 days amid Donald Trump's tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-rule-for-canadians-staying-in-the-us-for-over-30-days-amid-donald-trumps-tariff-war/articleshow/118984223.cms,"Canadians staying in the US will now have to register themselves with the authorities.

Will Canadians require a visa for the US?



Tariff war triggers new rule for Canadians?



Amid Donald Trump's ongoing tariff war with Canada, the US government has come up with a new rule for Canadians who are in the United States for 30 days or longer and those who have crossed the land border. Starting on April 11, Canadians who plan to stay in the US for longer than 30 days will be required to apply for registration and be fingerprinted. So far, Canadians have been exempt from both rules which apply to other foreign nationals.Traditionally, Canadians who cross the northern border by land and stay for over 30 days do not need to register with the federal government. However, the new rule would require them to fill out a different form to enter the US, which is not a visa. Canadians never needed any form or visa to enter the US for casual travelling, tourism, shopping etc.Those violating the rule may face fines of up to $5,000, six months in jail or both, according to the Federal Register, which was updated with the new guidance Wednesday.The new policy for Canadians is tied to President Donald Trump's executive order 'Protecting the American People Against Invasion' that he signed on the first day in the White House. The order is aimed at curbing ""the unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States"".According to Statistics Canada, 4.1 million Canadian residents arrived from trips abroad in December 2024. Of those, 2.1 million arrived from the United States by car, and 68.3% of those trips were taken within the same day.Reports said the new requirement is rooted in existing immigration law which states that foreign nationals of 14 or older and not already registered with American authorities have to register and fingerprinted if they plan to be in the US for 30 days or longer, but these rules were never applied to Canadians entering the US via land borders.It's now that the administration is moving to implement these rules for Canadians as Trump is engaged in a bitter trade war with Canada. The tariff war is now paused as both sides decided to sit across the table to address the situation.","Traditionally, Canadians who cross the northern border by land and stay for over 30 days do not need to register with the federal government.

The student, Ranjani Srinivasan , used the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11, 2025, after the Department of State cancelled her visa on March 5 due to security concerns.Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem confirmed the self-deportation and issued a statement saying, “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home App to self-deport.”Srinivasan’s case comes amid increased scrutiny of foreign students in the US following pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. Another Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested by ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers in Newark for overstaying her F-1 student visa, which had expired on January 26, 2022. Kordia had previously been arrested in April 2024 for participating in pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University.Also read: Who is Ranjani Srinivasan? Why did the US revoke the Indian scholar's visa? The DHS has not released further details about Srinivasan’s alleged activities but confirmed that video footage of her departure using the CBP Home App had been obtained.Ranjani Srinivasan is an Indian national who was pursuing a doctoral degree in Urban Planning at Columbia University. A Fulbright recipient, she holds an M.Phil in Urban Planning from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP), a Master’s in Design from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design, and a Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) from CEPT University in India.According to Srinivasan’s bio on NYU Wagner’s official website, her research focuses on “the evolving nature of land-labour relations in peri-urban statutory towns in India,” with broader interests in “the political economy of development, the spatial politics of land, and the sociology of labour.”The US government has not disclosed additional details regarding the specific reasons behind the visa revocation beyond allegations of supporting Hamas.","Ranjani Srinivasan used the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11, 2025.

Donald Trump files emergency Supreme Court appeal after judges block birthright citizenship ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-files-emergency-supreme-court-appeal-after-judges-block-birthright-citizenship-ban/articleshow/118999901.cms,"ANI

The Trump administration in an emergency appeal on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to allow its plan to end birthright citizenship , arguing that lower courts overstepped by blocking the policy.Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional, citing America’s long history of granting citizenship by birth . Trump is now pushing for an emergency ruling to enforce his order in limited cases.In January, a federal judge declared Trump’s executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional,"" preventing it from taking effect. Another judge in Maryland ruled that the order contradicts over 250 years of American law. Courts in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington have all blocked the policy following lawsuits from over 20 states, immigrant rights groups, and individual plaintiffs.The Justice Department argued that nationwide injunctions have become excessive, preventing the government from enforcing a key immigration policy. It also accused past administrations of wrongly interpreting the Constitution, saying that birthright citizenship was never meant to apply to children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The administration believes this has encouraged illegal immigration.Signed on January 20—his first day back in office—Trump’s executive order aims to end automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders. The policy applies to births from February 19 onward and does not affect those already granted citizenship.According to ANI, Trump’s appeal does not ask the Supreme Court to decide whether the policy itself is constitutional. Instead, his lawyers are making a “modest” request to limit the scope of the lower court injunctions.The Supreme Court will likely schedule a briefing to hear arguments from those who oppose Trump’s order.","Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional, citing America’s long history of granting citizenship by birth.

'Holds UAE resident identity card': How Karnataka DGP's daughter Ranya Rao cleared airport checks with 'VIP help',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/holds-uae-resident-identity-card-how-karnataka-dgps-daughter-ranya-rao-cleared-airport-checks-with-vip-help/articleshow/118962057.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Bengaluru Special Court for Economic Offences has reserved its verdict on Kannada actress Ranya Rao’s bail plea in the gold smuggling case, with the judgment expected on March 14.During the hearing, Senior Advocate Kiran Javali, representing Rao, argued that the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) failed to follow due legal procedures during her arrest and questioning. He claimed the arrest memo did not explicitly mention the ""grounds of arrest,"" violating the Supreme Court's DK Basu guidelines. Javali contended that such lapses warrant bail, irrespective of the severity of the allegations.The DRI, opposing the bail, emphasized the gravity of the charges against Rao, who was arrested at Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport on March 3 with 14 kg of gold. Prosecutors argued that releasing her could disrupt the ongoing investigation and lead to evidence tampering or witness intimidation.Ranya Rao has alleged mistreatment during her detention, claiming DRI officials verbally abused her and pressured her into signing documents without proper consent. The DRI, however, dismissed these claims, asserting that all protocols were followed lawfully.The agency also revealed that Rao had managed to clear immigration and the Green Channel with assistance from the State Protocol Office before being intercepted just outside the airport exit. This has raised serious concerns over the involvement of state officials in the smuggling racket.Meanwhile, a fresh controversy erupted after the Karnataka government withdrew its approval for a CID probe into the alleged police escort provided to Rao at the airport. Sources suggest the abrupt U-turn came under pressure from influential circles, fearing revelations from a police constable who was intercepted while escorting Rao could implicate senior officials.The state home department defended the move, stating that a separate probe led by senior IAS officer and Additional Chief Secretary Gaurav Gupta was already underway to examine the role of the state protocol wing and DGP Ramachandra Rao, Ranya’s father.Basavaraj, a head constable from the airport police station, told the CBI on Tuesday that he had merely followed ""oral instructions from senior IPS officers"" regarding receiving and dropping off their family members at the airport. However, he denied any knowledge of the gold smuggling. Investigators are now probing who exactly ordered Basavaraj to escort Rao during her travels.The CBI has already questioned Basavaraj and two other officials in an attempt to reconstruct the events leading up to Rao’s arrest. Sources indicate that the actress had directly contacted the constable before her arrival from Dubai, suggesting a prior arrangement.Public prosecutor Madhu N Rao, representing the DRI, reiterated the agency’s firm stance against granting bail. “We oppose the bail petition since it is a matter of national security . The accused is not cooperating with us. The incident indicates that an established syndicate is working behind (gold smuggling), and we have to investigate the hawala angle, too,” he said.The DRI has also summoned the protocol officer who allegedly assisted Rao. Additionally, the agency revealed that the actress holds a UAE resident identity card , adding another layer to the investigation.",A Bengaluru Special Court for Economic Offences has reserved its verdict on Kannada actress Ranya Rao’s bail plea in the gold smuggling case. The judgment is expected on March 14.

What is the US government shutdown?

Senate Democrats weigh GOP stopgap bill as government shutdown looms

The US government will attempt to prevent a shutdown on Friday, which will take effect if the Senate fails to pass the continuing resolution for funding.The bill which sailed through the Congress faces a tough battle in the Senate with the GOP needing at least eight Democrat votes.Democrats oppose the bill, arguing that it grants President Donald Trump excessive control over spending decisions. They face a choice between blocking it or allowing a government funding lapse.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, however, made it clear on Thursday that he will not allow a government shutdown. ""While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,"" Schumer said.In US, a government shutdown occurs when a funding gap forces the partial or full closure of federal agencies and operations.Government shutdowns typically happen when lawmakers fail to agree on budget allocations before the current funding cycle expires.The US government is at risk of a shutdown starting at 11.59 pm on Friday (local time) unless Congress can reach an agreement on funding.If an agreement isn’t reached by then, federal employees could be furloughed without pay, though some will still be required to work. Federal contractors, however, will not be obligated to work and are not assured back pay for the duration of the shutdown, according to ABC news.Certain ""mandatory"" programs will continue operating. Social Security and Medicare payments will still be distributed, as they are classified as mandatory spending.Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) warned that a government shutdown would give the president greater control over federal operations. ""If you shut down the government, the president is the person who decides what is essential,"" he said, as quoted by the New York Post. ""He decides what part of the government stays open, so you are actually giving him even more power,"" he added.","The US government is at risk of a shutdown starting at 11.59 pm on Friday (local time) unless Congress can reach an agreement on funding.

SpaceX launched a fresh crew to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday night, setting the stage for Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.The new team—Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov—blasted off from Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX capsule as part of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program. Their arrival, expected late Saturday, will allow them to replace the existing crew, including Williams, Wilmore, Nasa’s Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The transition will enable Wilmore and Williams to hand over operations before their scheduled departure next week, pending weather conditions.Wilmore and Williams originally launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner capsule in June for what was meant to be a short test mission. However, technical issues, including helium leaks and thruster failures, forced Nasa to delay their return, eventually deciding to bring them back on a SpaceX mission. Their homecoming was further postponed due to battery repairs on a new SpaceX capsule, prompting the agency to use a refurbished one to speed up the process.During their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams continued ISS maintenance, including fixing a toilet, watering plants, and conducting experiments. Williams also set a record for the most spacewalking time by a female astronaut.The delay became politically charged when President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed the previous administration had stalled the astronauts' return. However, Wilmore and Williams have consistently backed Nasa’s decision-making.With their return now imminent, both astronauts expressed excitement about reuniting with their families. Wilmore, a church elder, looks forward to resuming in-person ministry, while Williams is eager to walk her Labrador retrievers.“We appreciate all the love and support from everybody,” Williams said earlier this week. “This mission has brought a little attention … but I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we’re doing” with space exploration.","Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.

Why Democrats backed down



Trump praises Schumer

WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday managed to avert a government shutdown with hours to spare for the midnight deadline, as the Democrats dropped plans to block a funding bill supported by Donald Trump , and voted to keep the lights on through September.The backing down by the Democrats cleared the path for the bill to be approved by the Senate, dominated by the US President-led Republicans. The proposal, drafted by the Republicans, was passed earlier this week by the House.Ted Cruz, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, accused the Democrats of attempting to 'delay the inevitable.'""In their typical fashion, Senate Democrats engaged in political theater to delay the inevitable and cause instability,"" Cruz said.""Americans voted for change under President Trump and Republican leadership after four years of chaos. The government is funded, let's get back to work,"" he added.Ahead of the crunch vote, Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the upper chamber, shocked his rank and file by announcing he would back the proposal.Despite pressure from their own grassroots to defy Trump, 10 Democrats, apprehensive they could be blamed over a shutdown with no obvious exit to it, backed down, and allowed the bill to advance to a final floor vote, where it only needed Republican support.Earlier, Schumer had warned a shutdown could play into the hands of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, and distract from DOGE's most unpopular actions, which now include firing half the Education Department's workforce.""Under a shutdown, the Trump administration would have wide-ranging authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential, furloughing staff members with no promise they would ever be rehired,"" Schumer wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times defending his decision to support the package.This was not enough to pacify the grassroots Democrats, who accused the veteran campaigner of 'betrayal' and 'caving.'More than 100 demonstrators gathered early outside Schumer's Brooklyn residence and raised slogans against him and the Democrats.Meanwhile, taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump praised Schumer for having 'guts.'""I appreciate Senator Schumer, and I think he did the right thing. Really, I'm very impressed by that,"" he told reporters later.(With AFP inputs)","US averts government shutdown with hours to spare for midnight deadline.

The revocation is part of a wider crackdown on foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism in the US.

Another student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested for overstaying her visa. She had previously been detained in 2024 for participating in protests at Columbia University.

Also, the arrest and potential deportation of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, has sparked national outrage and raised concerns about the rights of green card holders in the US.

President Donald Trump has warned that colleges failing to align with his policies could lose federal funding. His targets range from transgender athletes in women's sports to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes. On Friday, his administration announced investigations into 52 universities as part of its crackdown on DEI initiatives.

The administration has also withdrawn $400 million in federal grants and contracts, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Ranjani Srinivasan , an Indian doctoral student at Columbia University , has ""self-deported"" after her visa was revoked.The US government accused her of supporting Hamas and advocating violence. Her visa was cancelled on March 5, 2025, and she used the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that living and studying in the US is a privilege and should not be extended to those who support terrorism.“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathisers use the CBP Home App to self-deport,” she said.","Ranjani Srinivasan is an Indian national and doctoral student at Columbia University.

Passengers evacuate onto wing as American Airlines plane catches fire in Denver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/passengers-evacuate-onto-wing-as-american-airlines-plane-catches-fire-in-denver/articleshow/119025943.cms,"A Boeing 737-800 carrying 172 passengers and six crew members caught fire while taxiing to a gate at Denver International Airport on Thursday, forcing an emergency evacuation onto the aircraft’s wing, officials said. The plane had been diverted mid-flight due to engine vibrations before landing safely.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the American Airlines flight 1006 was traveling from Colorado Springs to Dallas-Fort Worth when the crew reported engine trouble. Upon landing in Denver at around 5:15 p.m., an engine caught fire as the plane taxied to the gate.Passengers scrambled to exit, some using slides while others climbed onto the left wing as black smoke billowed from the right-side engine. “I chose to stay calm,” passenger Hani Levi, a former military airplane mechanic, said. She described thick smoke filling the cabin as some passengers panicked. “A mother screamed that she needed to get off with her two children, one of whom tried to run toward the front of the plane.”Another passenger, Daniel Friedman, recalled the chaos. “Really, I just wanted to make sure we got here safe and didn’t know if it was going to happen or not,” he told WRAL-TV. “I don’t wish that upon anybody.”Twelve passengers were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, according to airport officials. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have launched an investigation into the incident. American Airlines thanked first responders and crew members for their swift action but did not clarify the exact cause of the fire. The damaged plane was later seen parked behind a hangar at the airport.A replacement aircraft transported passengers to Dallas-Fort Worth, arriving early Friday morning. Aviation experts said engine fires are rare but typically not catastrophic. “A pilot going to work for an airline today could likely fly for 30 years and never experience an engine failure,” said Steven Wallace, a former FAA accident investigations director.The incident comes amid growing concerns over air travel safety following a series of recent aviation mishaps, including a Japan Airlines plane clipping a parked Delta jet in Seattle and a Toronto flight overturning upon landing. However, former NTSB Chairman James Hall cautioned against drawing conclusions. “Given the past history, you can classify it as unusual,” he said, “but I don’t know if you have enough information to draw any conclusions.”Boeing declined to comment on the incident, while CFM International, the engine manufacturer, did not immediately respond to inquiries.

WASHINGTON: A federal judge refused Friday to block the destruction of classified documents as part of the building cleanout at the US agency for international development, finding that records slated for shredding or burning are old or no longer needed.The documents don't appear to be related to the ongoing court battles over the near-dismantling of USAID by the Trump administration, US district judge Carl Nichols found as he refused to grant a temporary restraining order.A second federal judge is expected to consider a separate lawsuit over the document destruction Friday afternoon.The cases come as the Trump administration dismantles USAID , cutting off most federal money and terminating 83% of humanitarian and development programs abroad. All but a few hundred staffers are being pulled off the job and the agency's Washington headquarters is being shut down.A union for USAID contractors had asked Nichols, who was appointed by US President Donald Trump, to intervene to stop the destruction of possible evidence after an email ordering staffers to help burn and shred agency records became public.The Trump administration said the email had been taken out of context as trained USAID staff cleared out the agency's building. The classified documents slated for destruction were largely copies of those held by other agencies or derived from other classified material, Erica Carr, acting executive secretary at USAID, said in court documents.Any personnel records or those related to current classified programs are being retained, she said.She also pledged to contact the plaintiffs before any more documents are destroyed.The collection, retention and disposal of classified material and federal records are closely regulated by federal law.The classified documents at USAID emerged as an issue last month when the Trump administration put the agency's top two security officials on leave after they refused to grant members of Elon Musk's government-cutting teams access to classified material.",Judge won't block destruction of old USAID classified documents as the building is cleaned out.

Foreign weapons, deadly assault

Terror links & Kurram crackdown

Compensation & safe city project

Pakistani authorities have identified the suicide bombers behind the Darul Uloom Haqqania and Bannu cantonment attacks, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed announced on Friday. The development comes as investigators analyze CCTV footage and forensic evidence to track the origins of the attackers.The Bannu attack, which claimed the lives of five soldiers and 13 civilians, involved foreign weapons and a well-planned assault. Investigators have traced the vehicles used and are working to determine how the attackers infiltrated the region. Sixteen militants were killed during the attack, but questions remain about their network and handlers.Meanwhile, a powerful blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania, a renowned madrassa in Akora Khattak, left a top cleric and four worshippers dead, with several others injured.Authorities are probing whether the suicide bombers had links outside Pakistan and how they managed to cross borders undetected. In a separate operation, security forces arrested over 100 suspects linked to recent violence in Kurram, an area plagued by sectarian and militant activity.Acknowledging the role of terrorism in the Kurram violence, IG Hameed assured that a new security strategy was being developed to prevent further attacks. He expressed confidence that ""sustainable peace will soon be established.""Families of the Bannu attack victims have been given PKR 1 million each in compensation. In a broader move to tighten security, authorities have approved the Safe City Project, expected to be completed within months.As investigations continue, Pakistan remains on high alert, with officials bracing for further threats amid rising militant activity.","Pakistani authorities have identified the suicide bombers behind the Darul Uloom Haqqania and Bannu cantonment attacks.

A bomb explosion during Friday prayers at a mosque in South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, injured four worshippers, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem.According to the news agency ANI, the blast occurred at 1:45 pm (local time) at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque on Azam Warsak Bypass Road. According to district police officer (DPO) Asif Bahader, the improvised explosive device (IED) was planted inside the mosque’s pulpit, reported Dawn.""In the explosion, Abdullah Nadeem, the district chief of JUI, was seriously wounded,"" Bahader told Dawn. He added that three other injured individuals—Rehmanullah, Mullah Noor and Shah Behran—sustained minor injuries.All victims were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Wana for medical treatment.""The police have also reached the site of the blast and are collecting evidence,"" Bahader said, adding that an investigation was underway.According to ANI, mosques in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have frequently been targeted, particularly during Friday prayers, when large congregations gather.Just last month, a suicide blast killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others at the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in Nowshera.In a deadlier attack on January 30, 2023, a bomb ripped through a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines area, killing at least 59 people and injuring 157 others, as per Dawn. The death toll later rose to 101, according to the KP health department. The suicide bomber detonated the explosives inside the mosque, collapsing parts of the prayer hall while nearly 400 worshippers, mostly police officers, were present.Similarly, in 2022, a suicide bombing at Jamia Masjid Koocha Risaldar in Peshawar’s old city killed multiple worshippers. The bomber first shot police personnel at the mosque’s entrance before detonating himself inside the hall where a large congregation was offering Friday prayers, reported Dawn.Security officials in South Waziristan have begun examining the blast site to determine who was responsible for planting the IED inside the mosque.

Militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours. The Pakistani military later announced on Wednesday that a successful rescue operation had ended the standoff, freeing the hostages and eliminating over 30 militants.Earlier on Tuesday, Mehboob Hussain was travelling when an explosion damaged the tracks beneath the front carriage. The nine-coach Jaffar Express came to a stop in the isolated Bolan Pass of central Pakistan, an area devoid of internet and mobile connectivity. Subsequently, gunfire erupted.""I was a passenger on the train that was attacked,"" Hussain told BBC Urdu. He and roughly 440 fellow passengers were travelling from Quetta to Peshawar through Balochistan province when armed militants launched their attack, bombing the tracks, shooting at the train and boarding the carriages.Officials report that 300 passengers have been rescued, whilst 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel lost their lives. However, fate of several passengers remains uncertain, with reports from Reuters and AFP suggesting some militants departed with an unknown number of hostages.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group operating in Pakistan's Balochistan province, quickly claimed responsibility for the train hijacking, threatening to kill hostages unless Pakistani authorities released Baloch political prisoners.BBC interviewed several witnesses who recounted the terrifying events aboard the train during the attack. ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor a passenger said.A railway police officer aboard the train told the outlet that, contrary to initial official statements, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" during the attack.The BLA has shared purported footage of the train explosion. The video displays an exposed track section alongside a substantial rocky incline. The footage shows BLA fighters positioned at the summit of this incline.The officer detailed to the BBC how he initially ""fought together with other police officers"" to resist the militants until ""the ammunition ran out"".""They [the BLA] were moving in front of us on the mountain and they were much more numerous than us, in the hundreds,"" the officer, speaking anonymously, stated.He mentioned being accompanied by four railway police and two Frontier Corps (FC) paramilitary members. ""I told my companion to give me the G-3 rifle because it is a better weapon,"" the officer explained.""When I got the rifle and the rounds, we also started firing back. I used to fire one shot at a time at them so that they could not come near us and the train... [But] in an hour-and-half, our rounds were over... We were helpless,"" he added.After the gunfire from the Jaffar Express subsided, armed militants descended from the mountains and began evacuating passengers. The officer described how they conducted identity checks and segregated hostages based on their ethnicity alongside the train.According to the passengers, the militants issued threats speaking in Balochi stating their demands to the government and warning of severe consequences, including burning the vehicle if their demands weren't met. The officer noted that the militants received instructions to execute people, targeting both military personnel and civilians from the segregated groups.The militants permitted certain groups to leave unharmed, including women, children, elderly individuals and Balochistan residents, according to Noor.Noor Muhammad, who was amongst those released, described how armed men entered the train after an hour of gunfire, demanding passengers to exit under threat.Muhammad and his wife were escorted off the train and instructed to walk straight ahead without looking back. They reached Panir Railway Station at about 1900 after a challenging journey through wilderness. His wife recounted their rescue by Pakistan military personnel who transported them safely to Machh and subsequently to their waiting children in Quetta.The police official, speaking anonymously, described how numerous BLA militants began departing as night fell. ""Many of them hugged each other and 70, 80 people left while 20, 25 stayed behind,"" he said.Violence erupted again around 10pm when some attempted to flee. ""Some people tried to run away, they [the BLA] saw them and opened fire, then everyone fell to the ground,"" the official added.Mehboob another passenger further recounted continuous gunfire throughout the night and described how a person near him, a father of five daughters, was shot.""When someone is killed in front of your eyes, you don't know what to do,"" he said.Another passenger, Allahditta, recounted how the BLA killed his cousin before his eyes. He mentioned that his cousin begged for his life, citing his young daughters, but ""his life was not spared"".The rescue operation began during Wednesday morning prayers when FC forces engaged the militants. Amidst the chaos, several hostages managed to escape.The police official described fleeing with his injured companion, carrying him beyond the firing range with assistance from another person. Mehboob, Allahdita, the police official and his companion survived the ordeal during the FC's intervention.The Balochistan Liberation Army has been fighting for an independent Baloch state and has intensified attacks in recent years, targeting security forces, infrastructure, and foreign investments, particularly Chinese projects.While the group has a history of attacking military camps, railway stations, and trains, this marked the first time they had hijacked a train.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp in Jandola area of Tank district, in the country’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Thursday, killing 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The assault on the FC (a paramilitary force), which began with a massive explosion and turned into a fierce gun battle, marks the second major militant attack in Pakistan this week, underscoring growing security threats in the region.The attack commenced in the early hours when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives near the perimeter of Jandola base in the restive tribal district near the Afghan border. The blast tore through the camp’s defences, paving the way for an armed assault by TTP fighters. Security forces responded swiftly, engaging the attackers in a prolonged exchange of heavy gunfire. By mid-morning, the military declared the situation under control, reporting that all assailants had been neutralised.“The brave soldiers of the Frontier Corps stood their ground and eliminated the threat with precision,” said a spokesperson for the Pakistan military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Ten terrorists were sent to their deaths in this operation, proving once again our resolve to protect the nation.”While official statements did not disclose casualties among security personnel or civilians, unverified reports circulating on social media platforms, including X, suggested significant damage to the camp and hinted at dozens of potential casualties. Authorities have yet to confirm these claims, and details remain scarce as the area has been cordoned off.The TTP, a militant group seeking to overthrow Pakistani governance in the tribal regions, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. The assault comes just two days after another deadly attack in Balochistan, where Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked the Jaffar Express train, killing 21 hostages and four soldiers before being eliminated by security forces.Analysts see the Jandola attack as part of a broader resurgence of militancy in Pakistan’s border regions, fuelled by instability in neighbouring Afghanistan and the TTP’s renewed aggression. “This is a clear escalation,” said security expert Ayesha Khan in Islamabad. “The TTP is testing the military’s defences, and the proximity to the Afghan border only complicates the response.”Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion followed by hours of gunfire, with some describing the scene as chaotic. “We hid in our homes, praying it would end soon,” said Javed Khan, a shopkeeper near Jandola. “The army fought hard, but it’s a reminder that we’re never far from danger here.”",Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp. 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed.

ISLAMABAD: Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down after the 17-member Afghan delegation walked out, accusing Pakistan of not taking the negotiations seriously, official sources said on Thursday.The cross-border movement of people via Torkham border crossing, a critical trade and transit point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was abruptly suspended on Feb 21 after Pakistani and Afghan security forces developed differences over construction activities on both sides of the border. The situation worsened this month when eight people, including six troops, were injured after Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces traded fire at the border. A number of houses, a mosque and some clearing agents’ offices were hit by artillery, and cross-border firing continued for three days.To address the issue, both sides had formed their jirgas — traditional assemblies of tribal elders and representatives — which held its first meeting this week in which both sides agreed to a ceasefire. The talks, however, broke down on Wednesday when the Afghan delegation, led by Younus Mohmand, chairman of the Afghan chamber of commerce, walked out.The Afghan delegation was surprised to find that Pakistan had expanded its delegation list without prior consultation. Instead of the agreed 17 members, Pakistan presented a list of 70 individuals, many of whom the Afghan side considered irrelevant to negotiations.After waiting two hours for a response, the Afghan jirga left for Kabul, expressing frustration with Pakistan’s approach. Mohmand criticised Pakistan’s actions, stating that the addition of unrelated individuals reflected a lack of seriousness in resolving the dispute.The collapse of talks highlights the fragile state of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations , especially over border issues like the Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not officially recognise. Pakistani customs officials at Torkham said the border closure was causing a loss of around $1.5 million daily as exports to Afghanistan have stopped. Additionally, $2 million in revenue has been lost due to suspension of imports from Afghanistan.","Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.
