took over:

SC

to

Bihar cops

NEW DELHI: To identify candidates who benefited from the NEET-UG question paper leak in Bihar and determine the spread of the leakage, Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the National Testing agency (NTA) to upload on its website by Saturday noon the centre-wise results of the examination taken by more than 23 lakh students competing for over 1 lakh MBBS seats.The CJI-led bench, however, asked NTA not to disclose names of candidates in the uploaded results. It said publication of these results was essential as the 44 petitioner students have no wherewithal to identify whether a centre-wise success pattern existed.This also ties in with the court's concern about ascertaining whether the leak was a localised affair or stretched across centres. The much-awaited hearing, in which the bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra appeared hewed to its position that it would not cancel the entrance test unless satisfied the leak was not limited to just one centre, saw the justices making it clear they would go deep into the malaise that allegedly compromised the integrity of the test. They also reiterated the larger interest of over 23 lakh students, many of whom belonged to poor or middle class families and strived for years to succeed in the examination.Significantly, although SC appeared to be going by the findings of the CBI probe, it also summoned evidence from Bihar Police which exposed the matter. ""The material collected by Bihar Police through the investigation and the report of Economic Offences Wing of Bihar Police, before the investigation was taken over by CBI, shall be filed in the court by 5pm on July 20,"" said the bench as it responded to the contention of the petitioners' counsel, senior advocate Narender Hooda, that NTA's stand was at variance with the findings of Bihar cops. SC scheduled the hearing for Monday.After perusing two probe status reports by CBI, SC said, ""It appears there was no systemic wrong... at Godhra (where re-examination was held). Wrongdoing happened at Hazaribag (where the sealed envelope of question paper was tampered with and photos of question paper was taken prior to examination on May 5) and Patna.""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta explained the modus operandi of the paper-leak gang and said they had taken advance money from parents and post-dated cheques running into lakhs for enabling their children to take advantage of the wrongdoing. He said the gang did it for money and never wanted the leaked paper to be circulated, or, to be precise, expose those who had paid money, as that would have led to cancellation of the examination, which would have been detrimental to their illicit business.Mehta said a photo of the question paper was taken out and the gang engaged seven question-solvers to provide answers within one hour on May 5 morning. The gang then called targeted students and made them memorise the answers. He said CBI has arrested the person who took a photo of the question paper at Oasis School (Hazaribag), its centre superintendent, three question-solvers and some of the gang members.The SG said the first 100 rankers are spread across 95 centres in 56 cities. He said the students who benefited from the localised leak would not exceed 150, that no benefit would be enured to them as they have been identified, and that necessary action would be taken against them.","Supreme Court orders National Testing agency to upload on its website by Saturday noon the centre-wise results of the examination taken by more than 23 lakh students competing for over 1 lakh MBBS seats.

Usha Chilukuri Vance , an Indian-origin litigator, is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump 's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections on Monday. Usha Vance carries rich Indian cultural values and has a strong legal background, making her a key figure in this political partnership.Usha Vance, daughter of Indian immigrants, is a litigator at a national law firm.She graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in History and earned a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work. Her academic journey saw her serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law & Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal. As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI. ""She knows the Indian culture and all about India.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

Owaisi links order to Hitler's Germany

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh Police on Thursday faced criticism across the spectrum over its order directing Muzaffarnagar eateries to ""voluntarily display"" their owners' names to ""facilitate"" Kanwar Yatris.The orders have been issued to the eateries functional on the routes of Kanwar Yatra.Police said the intention behind the order was not to create any ""religious discrimination"" but only to help the devotees.""About 240 km of Kanwar Yatra route falls in the district. All the eateries, including hotels, dhabas and carts, on the route, have been asked to display the names of their proprietors or those working on these shops,"" Muzaffarnagar police chief Abhishek Singh told news agency PTI.""This has been done to ensure that there should be no confusion among kanwariyas and no law and order situation arises. All are following this voluntarily,"" he said.However, despite the clarification on the issue, a massive backlash has erupted over the order of UP Police.Ex-UP chief minister and Kannauj MP Akhilesh Yadav questioned the intention of the government and urged the court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter.The Samajwadi Party chief said, ""... And what if the name of the owner is Guddu, Munna, Chhotu or Fatte?

2 soldiers wounded in Doda camp attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-soldiers-wounded-in-doda-camp-attack/articleshow/111844836.cms,"JAMMU: Two soldiers were wounded in a terrorist attack around 3am Thursday on a temporary security camp established in a govt school in Kastigarh area of Doda district of J&K. It is part of the Jammu region that has been plagued by a series of terrorism-linked violence recently, including the July 15 shootout in which four men from 10 Rashtriya Rifles lost their lives.This was the eighth gunfight with terrorists in Doda since June 11-12.Sources said the latest assault could have been carried out by the same group of suspected Pakistani terrorists tied to Kashmir Tigers, a shadow group of Jaish-e-Mohammad, which was believed to be involved in the July 15 fatal attack on a search party in Desa, a thickly forested and mountainous area about 55km from Doda town. Kashmir Tigers claimed responsibility for both the Desa attack and a July 8 ambush on a two-truck military patrol in Kathua.It is estimated that 20-25 “foreign” terrorists, armed with sophisticated weapons such as American M4 carbines, are active in Doda district, the sources said. They operate in small groups of three to four within a 30-40 square km area. “The terrorists know the topography well and are exploiting the thick forest cover for their attacks,” a source said.Of the 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists active in J&K, nearly 55 to 60 are in Jammu zone, according to official sources. Since Oct 2021, at least 49 security personnel have been killed in the region — including 39 from the Army and one from IAF.Despite ongoing seek-and-kill operations supported by drones, helicopters, and military dogs, challenging terrain and adverse weather conditions have hindered security efforts. The remote and rugged landscape, dotted with deep gorges, thick woods, mountain caves, and other natural hideouts, provides ample cover for terrorists operating in small groups.The capability of these heavily armed groups to coordinate attacks remains a major challenge forsecurity forces . This was evidenced by the July 8 ambush on the military patrol that resulted in the deaths of five soldiers from 22 Garhwal Rifles in Kathua.Intelligence sources said foreign terrorists are employing new methods for border-crossing and executing attacks in Jammu region. These methods include tunnelling beneath the fence to slip through the heavily guarded border and using advanced technology such as iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery.DIG (Doda Kishtwar-Ramban range) Shridhar Patil visited the site in Kastigarh. He said a coordinated manhunt is underway, but refrained from sharing detailed information.Despite heavy rain, an IAF helicopter promptly evacuated the two wounded soldiers to the military hospital in Udhampur for treatment. Security forces repulsed the attack with counterfire lasting more than an hour, according to security sources. The terrorists managed to escape, using the dense foliage and darkness to their advantage.Village defence guards (VDGs) are assisting security forces in the counteroffensive. On Wednesday, VDGs opened fire after observing suspicious movement in Kralaan village of Doda.Authorities warned people against providing shelter, food, or aiding the terrorists in hiding and navigating the area undetected. Police have arrested two men, including Showket Ali, who allegedly provided food, shelter, and WiFi access to three terrorists before the July 15 attack in Desa.

TOI

CHENNAI: Exposing more tentacles of the gold smuggling racket at Chennai airport , government has suspended an undisclosed number of immigration officials for their suspected links with the smugglers .A top Intelligence Bureau official said three of the officials had been placed under suspension. But airport sources toldthat many more officers have faced action.“The number is being under-reported to avoid scrutiny of the immigration section by other agencies such as Directorate of Revenue intelligence (DRI) and Customs ,” an official said.The charge against the suspended personnel is that, for a cut from the smugglers, they collected gold from carriers arriving at the airport and sneaked it outside to receivers. They are also accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.An IB officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the nexus of the three officers with gold smugglers was being probed. One of them is Saravanan, who was on deputation to the IB. The officer refused to name the other two. “Action is being taken for the charges against them as mentioned in the memo,” he said.The officer said the suspension procedure was initiated only for internal procedural lapses. “We got intelligence that they allow flyers without verification of documents under the Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) category. How long they have been doing this and the money trail are being probed. If their involvement in gold smuggling had been proved, they would have been booked by now,” he said.The officer said the suspension orders were issued before Customs busted a cartel that smuggled in 267kg gold, worth about Rs 167 crore, in about two months. They used a souvenir shop as a front at the international terminal.Officials said they have detected similar offences in the past and suspended erring personnel. At least 45 immigration personnel, including many state police personnel on deputation to IB, are deployed at the airport for clearing international passengers.","Officials accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.

'JD Learned Indian...': Usha Vance Takes Centrestage At Republican Convention | Watch

Watch Live: Republican National Convention Day Three | WSJ

Usha Chilukuri Vance took centre stage at the Republican National Convention on Thursday to introduce her husband, JD Vance , as Donald Trump 's running mate for the upcoming US presidential election.In her speech at the RNC, Usha shared their story, detailing how they first met and the journey that led them to this significant occasion where JP Vance stands as Donald Trump's Vice President running mate.She described JD as a working-class individual who overcame childhood traumas to attend Yale Law School with the support of the G.I. Bill.""When I was asked to introduce my husband, JD Vance, to all of you, I was at a loss. It occurred to me that there was only one thing to do: to explain, from the heart, why I love and admire JD, why I stand here beside him today, and why he will make a great Vice President of the United States,"" Usha said.She continued, ""I met JD in law school when he was fresh out of Ohio State, which he attended with the support of the G.I. Bill. He was then, as now, the most interesting person I knew. A working-class guy who had overcome childhood traumas that I could barely fathom to end up at Yale Law School. A tough Marine who had served in Iraq, but whose idea of a good time was playing with puppies.""She also went on to describe her husband as the meat and potatoes guy who learned to cook Indian food for her and her mother.""Although he's a meat and potatoes kinda guy. He adapted to my vegetarian diet & learned to cook food from my mother. Indian food. before I knew it. he'd become an integral part of my family. The JD I knew then is the same JD Vance you see today, except for that beard,"" she said.In his inaugural address as Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance shared his challenging childhood in Ohio, growing up without a father and with a mother battling drug addiction.Accepting his nomination, Vance called on Americans to ""choose a new path,"" asserting that the country's leaders have repeatedly failed. He credited his grandmother, affectionately called ""Mamaw,"" for his achievements and described her as ""tough as nails. He shared an anecdote about her threatening to run over a local drug-dealing boy with her car if Vance continued to associate with him.Vance's selection and transformation position him as a potential future leader of the Republican Party and the torchbearer of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" political movement, which has significantly reshaped the GOP and upended long-standing political norms.As the first millennial to be part of a major party ticket's top tier, Vance enters the race at a time when voters are increasingly concerned about the age of the leading candidates, with Trump being 78 and Biden 81 years old.","Usha Chilukuri Vance introduced her husband, JD Vance, as Donald Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential election.

Maatouk had recently taken over the position from another commander, Ali Ahmed Hassin, who was also killed in an Israeli strike in April.The strike that killed Maatouk was one of several on the neighbouring border villages of Safad El Battikh and Jmaijmeh.Eighteen wounded individuals were taken to the nearby Tebnine government hospital, as reported by its director, Mohammed Hamadi, to Reuters.However, it was not immediately clear how many of the wounded were fighters and how many were civilians.In a speech on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned that the group would expand the range of its attacks in Israel if more civilians were targeted.Earlier on Thursday, Hamas reported that one of their commanders had been killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon's West Bekaa, while a Hezbollah member was killed in a separate Israeli strike in the southern town of Jbal El Botm. Throughout the day, Hezbollah announced attacks on Israel with dozens of rockets and missiles, including on the Filon base in Israel's Safed for the first time.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began when Hezbollah declared a ""support front"" with Palestinians shortly after its ally Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on October 7, prompting Israel's military offensive inGaza .The fighting in Lebanon has resulted in the deaths of more than 100 civilians and over 300 Hezbollah fighters, according to a Reuters tally, and has caused significant destruction in Lebanese border towns and villages, comparable to the levels seen during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.International observers have expressed growing concerns in recent weeks that Israel may expand its military operations in Lebanon, potentially leading to a wider war.

"Ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro, just released from prison, gets roaring applause at RNC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-trump-adviser-peter-navarro-just-released-from-prison-gets-roaring-applause-at-rnc/articleshow/111829862.cms,"MILWAUKEE: Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro took the stage at the Republican National Convention to enthusiastic cheers hours after being released from prison and pushed talk of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol to the center of an event that has largely avoided mentioning the riot.Navarro left a Miami prison in the morning, completing a four-month sentence for refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the attack by a mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters trying to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.He then took a flight to Milwaukee.Immediately, Navarro attacked the committee that led the investigation and cast his time in prison as a sign of loyalty to Trump.""The J6 committee demanded that I betray Donald John Trump to save my own skin,"" he said. ""I refused.""His remarks were the first extended mention of the Capitol riot during the first three days of the RNC after programming that has been heavily focused on the economy, national security and immigration. But Trump often mentions the riot in his rallies and speeches - and many in his GOP base argue that the hundreds of people jailed on charges related to the riot have been wrongly prosecuted.""I went to prison so you won't have to,"" Navarro told the raucous crowd. ""I am your wakeup call.""Navarro received some of the most thunderous applause of convention speakers to date, with one woman yelling out, ""I love you, Peter!""Navarro spoke for more than 10 minutes - one of the longest speeches yet -- about what he called the ""lawfare jackals"" he blamed for locking him up. He embraced his fiancee onstage to wild cheers.The scene was the sort of spectacle common at Trump rallies, where the presidential nominee routinely calls those convicted of crimes on Jan. 6 ""hostages."" But there hasn't been a similar moment at the convention, which has so far largely avoided talk about Trump's push to overturn his 2020 loss.In an interview before his speech, Navarro told The Associated Press he was just one example of what many on the right say is the Biden administration's use of the judiciary to punish its political enemies.""I'm a small part of the bigger issue,"" Navarro said, referring to the oft-repeated claim by conservatives that, during President Joe Biden's administration, the justice system has been used to hobble Trump and those close to him. ""If we don't control the government, the government will control us,"" Navarro said.The telephone interview took place as Navarro was awaiting takeoff from a Florida airport for the trip to Milwaukee.Despite his echo of a common GOP refrain that the Biden administration has ""weaponized"" the judicial system to punish Trump and his allies, Navarro said he planned to offer a message of unity, a common theme among Republicans in light of the assassination attempt on the former president Saturday.""To win the election, we have to unite not just the Republican party but the entire country,"" Navarro said. ""I'm going to reach out to Democrats disenchanted with the radical left.""Many ""mainstream Democrats"" are ""disenfranchised, disengaged and disgusted with the radical left,"" Navarro said. ""In Trump's America, people don't have to worry about food on the table, medicine in the cabinet and a roof over their head.""""Unity is my message,"" he added.Trump has accused the Justice Department of targeting him politically with indictments in two criminal cases even as the department also brought tax and gun charges against Biden's son, Hunter. Hunter Biden was convicted on three felony charges last month.A federal judge in Florida this week dismissed one of Trump's federal cases, which accused him of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The Justice Department plans to appeal.Attorney General Merrick Garland has forcefully defended the independence and integrity of the Justice Department against what he has described as unprecedented attacks by Republicans.""The idea that politics infects our prosecutions, nothing could be further from the truth. We have one rule. We follow the facts, and we follow the law and we make the appropriate decisions,"" Garland told reporters last month.Still, Navarro said Democrats are a potentially fertile voting bloc for Trump that he plans to try to reach in his convention speech.Trump won in 2016 in large part by carrying once-Democratic swaths of states carried by former President Barack Obama in 2012, including Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.""Just like Donald Trump, I am fighting for important principles,"" Navarro saidNavarro was the first senior Trump administration official to be locked up for a crime related to the Jan. 6 attack when he reported to a federal prison in Miami in March. He has called his conviction the ""partisan weaponization of the judicial system.""He was subpoenaed by the committee over his promotion of false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election in the run-up to the Capitol insurrection. He has maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. Courts have rejected that argument, finding that Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked privilege.Longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon reported to prison earlier this month to begin serving his four-month sentence on contempt of Congress charges for defying a subpoena in the congressional Jan. 6 investigation.The House committee spent 18 months investigating the deadly insurrection, interviewing more than 1,000 witnesses, holding 10 hearings and obtaining more than 1 million pages of documents. In its final report, the panel ultimately concluded that Trump criminally engaged in a ""multi-part conspiracy"" to overturn his election loss to Biden and failed to act to stop his supporters from storming the Capitol. Trump insists he did nothing wrong.",Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro takes the stage at the Republican National Convention to enthusiastic cheers.

Donald Trump , the Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday recounted his personal experience of the assassination attempt on his life during a rally at Pennsylvania rally.While delivering his speech at the closing night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump called for unity among Americans.Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.He shared the details of the incident, stating, ""I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the bullet would have perfectly hit its mark. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.""Trump said that the attack was swiftly ended by a Secret Service sniper, who took out the assassin with a single shot from a greater distance.“There was blood pouring everywhere, yet, in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,"" Trump said. “I'm not supposed to be here tonight.""The crowd responded with chants of ""Yes you are,"" to which Trump replied, ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.

Trump: Thousands gather at banquet hall to celebrate life of former fire chief killed at Trump rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-gather-at-banquet-hall-to-celebrate-life-of-former-fire-chief-killed-at-trump-rally/articleshow/111849536.cms,"FREEPORT: Thousands of mourners filed into a Pennsylvania banquet hall Thursday to remember the former fire chief who was fatally shot during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump , who sent a note of condolence hailing him as a hero.The crowd paying their respects to Corey Comperatore and his family appeared to be a mix of friends, neighbors and strangers who wanted to show their appreciation for the man who officials said spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at the campaign rally .Fire trucks and police vehicles filled the parking lot outside the building. Sharpshooters were positioned on top of the event hall and on nearby buildings as dozens of people waited in line to enter. Among the mourners were firefighters in dress uniforms.Comperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary.Trump suffered an ear injury but was not seriously hurt and has been participating this week in the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.Mourners filled Laube Hall, a space with white brick walls, white linens, white curtains and exposed wooden beams that's normally used for weddings and other celebratory occasions.Guests walked past a large, framed photo of Comperatore holding a fish, while a slideshow of photos from his life was projected on a screen - his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing on a lake and palling around with his beloved Dobermans.The gathering included firefighters from other nearby communities and people involved in local and state Republican politics.Rich Tallis, a Penn Hills volunteer firefighter who attended the visitation, did not know Comperatore personally but felt a need to honor his memory.""Any first responder, it's a brotherhood - police, EMS fire, military. We're technically all one,"" he said. ""When one goes, we all go.""Tables inside the hall were lined with flowers - some sent by fire departments in New York and West Virginia, an auto racing circuit and the mayor of a nearby community. Others came from people in faraway places such as Connecticut and Florida who knew of Comperatore only because of his death.The messages on the cards accompanying the arrangements praised his selflessness and dedication to his family. One said his name would be ""written in the history books.""Mourners took turns pausing in front of Comperatore's open casket, which was adorned with flower arrangements and ribbons with words such as ""dad"" and ""husband.""In a corner was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump. ""Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,"" they wrote.Retired New York City Fire Department Lt. Joe Torrillo said outside the visitation that he came because Comperatore was a firefighter who lost his life the same way he lived his life - like a hero.""And, you know, a lot of people maybe wouldn't or couldn't have done what he did,"" Torrillo said.Jon Ruffley, who lives outside Pittsburgh and attended part of the Trump rally Saturday, went to the visitation with his wife and young child. He said he hoped his presence sent a supportive message to the family that ""we stick together as Americans regardless of, you know, what someone's political affiliations are.""""I think it's really important that we raise our kids in a way where we can see that political violence is unacceptable, that we stand for having important discourses about things in, in our society,"" he said.A box truck parked on a route to the banquet hall displayed video screens showing slides, including a photograph of Trump raising his fist after Saturday's shooting. It had the slogan ""never surrender"" and a message expressing prayers for Trump and Comperatore.The visitation, which was broken into a pair of two-hour blocks, was the second of two public events memorializing and celebrating Comperatore's life. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.A private funeral is scheduled for Friday. Trump is not going to the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a source familiar who was not authorised to speak publicly.A statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a ""beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.""""Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,"" the statement said.Dan Ritter, who gave a eulogy at Wednesday's vigil, said he bought Comperatore's childhood home in 1993, sparking a friendship that grew with their shared values of family, Christian faith and politics.""Corey loved his family and was always spending time with them,"" Ritter said. ""This past Saturday was supposed to be one of those days for him. He did what a good father would do. He protected those he loved. He's a true hero for us all.""Comperatore's pastor, Jonathan Fehl of Cabot Methodist Church in Cabot, said the family ""has been humbled by the way this community has rallied around them"" and by the support they have received from people around the world.The vigil concluded with people in the crowd lighting candles and raising cellphones, glow sticks and lighters as Comperatore's favorite song - ""I Can Only Imagine,"" by Christian rock band MercyMe - played.Two other people were wounded at the rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.Joseph Feldman, an attorney for Copenhaver, said Wednesday that he had spoken with his client by phone.""He seems to be in good spirits, but he also understands the gravity of the situation,"" Feldman said. ""And he's deeply saddened about what has occurred, and he's deeply sympathetic"" to the other victims and their families.Feldman said Copenhaver suffered ""life-altering injuries,"" declining to go into detail. He said Copenhaver's priority is to ""keep up with the medical treatment he's receiving and hopefully be released at some point.""In a statement, Dutch's family thanked the ""greater western Pennsylvania community and countless others across the country and world"" for the incredible outpouring of prayers and well wishes.","Mourners filled Laube Hall, a space with white brick walls, white linens, white curtains and exposed wooden beams.

'20 min before shooting'

FBI officials told members of Congress on Wednesday that the gunman who tried to kill ex-Prez Donald Trump used his cellphone and other devices to search images of Trump and Prez Joe Biden , along with an array of public figures.The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks , also looked up dates of Trump's appearances and the Democratic National Convention, according to people on two conference calls held to answer lawmakers' questions.The disclosures, made during private briefings to lawmakers by the FBI and the head of the embattled Secret Service , offered the most complete portrait so far of a would-be assassin with no criminal history, or even clearly discernible political beliefs. Still, no clear motive for the attack has emerged.The FBI has been scouring Crooks' possessions, including two phones and at least one laptop, for clues about his motive. So far, they have found no indication that Crooks, who was a registered Republican, had strong partisan political views one way or another, bureau officials told lawmakers. Nor have they uncovered any evidence of co-conspirators or connections to foreign actors. The officials told lawmakers that there was some indication that the gunman, who led a quiet life and worked at a nursing home near his house, might have been struggling with depression. Officials said he had looked up ""major depressive disorder"".Among the other prominent figures the gunman searched for using one of his phones: FBI Director Christopher Wray; attorney general Merrick Garland; and a member of the British royal family, according to two sources. Wray, who was also on the calls, cautioned that the probe was still in early stages.Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, acknowledged during one of the calls that her agency made serious ""mistakes"", and provided new information about Crooks' movements during the shooting. During the briefing with senators, officials ran through a timeline of events, noting that law enforcement officers had identified the gunman as suspicious about an hour before the shooting but then lost track of him. About 20 minutes before the shooting, a sniper spotted him again, the sources said. Some senators left their call angry with the Secret Service after learning that officers did not intervene before he opened fire.","The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also looked up dates of Trump's appearances and the Democratic National Convention, according to people on two conference calls held to answer lawmakers' questions.

From 2011 to 2021, Dobbs hosted Lou Dobbs Tonight on the Fox Business Network, where he became known for his staunch support of former President Donald Trump and his anti-immigration views.

In recent years, Dobbs hosted a show on the streaming platform Lindell TV, owned by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a prominent supporter of Trump's false claims of election fraud.

Dobbs was born in Texas in 1945 and graduated from Harvard University with a degree in economics.

He briefly attended the University of Idaho and Idaho State University before being persuaded by his high school staff to apply to Harvard.

There are several potential scenarios that could unfold:Biden's withdrawal will likely trigger a complex process, with the party potentially needing to adjust its nomination procedures and navigate legal challenges at the state level.The Democratic Party will need to modify its nomination procedures, address legal hurdles at the state level, and quickly coalesce around a replacement candidate, all while navigating internal divisions and a tight timeline.If Joe Biden were to drop out of the 2024 US presidential race, there are several potential candidates who could replace him as the Democratic nominee:","President Biden would formally notify the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and other relevant party officials of his decision to withdraw. The DNC would confirm the withdrawal and begin the process of selecting a new candidate. The process would involve data analysis, polling, and direct conversations with potential candidates to assess their viability and appeal to the party's base. After the convention, state laws could present obstacles to replacing Biden on specific ballots.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111844748,imgsize-677869,width-400,resizemode-4/111844748.jpg"
