With gender & urban-rural gaps still on, India clears literacy exam with 80.9%

Committed to give remaining S-400s to India by 2026, says Russia

Today's morning news wrap covers updates related to business, defence, education and international relations. US commerce secretary Lutnick expressed optimism about forthcoming US-India trade deal, citing the strong rapport between US President Trump and PM Modi as a key facilitator. Meanwhile, seismic activity rocked the region as a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck near the Greece-Turkey border. In Pakistan, controversy erupted as Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmed Khan defended LeT leader Saifullah Kasuri, linked to the Pahalgam attack, by attending a rally with him and Talha Saeed. Back in India, the latest PLFS data revealed an overall literacy rate of 80.9%, with Mizoram, Lakshadweep, and Kerala leading the charts. On the defence front, Russia reaffirmed its commitment to delivering the remaining S-400 units to India by 2026, ahead of a planned visit by Putin later this year.Speaking at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum in Washington, Lutnick noted that the strong and positive rapport between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi paves the way for smoother trade negotiations.""Earlier countries get a better deal. That's the way it is. So those who come in, you know, July 4th to July 9th, there's just going to be a pile. I think India is trying hard to be one of the earlier countries, which I appreciate. But these, these kind of deals used to take two or three years, and we're trying to get them done in a month, which is, you know, just not the ordinary DNA of trading relationships between countries. But what I hope to achieve is we would like market access, we would like our businesses to have reasonable access to the markets of India,"" he said.

He also pointed to a personal link to Kasur, the town that hosted the May 28 rally.Talha’s appearance alongside Kasuri surfaced at a time when foreign policy circles were abuzz with discussions about Kasuri and his jihadist associates celebrating what they claimed was revenge for Pakistan’s partition following its defeat in the 1971 war.

We are not looking for war. We are looking only to send a message to terrorists, but through them, we want the message to be heard by those who are providing them safe haven, by those who are financing them, training them, equipping them, guiding them and sending them across the border.”Speaking in Brasilia after meeting Brazil’s top presidential adviser Celso Amorim, Tharoor said Brazil “fully sympathises” with India’s concerns on cross-border terrorism, especially in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and India’s subsequent response through Operation Sindoor ""It was a wonderful meeting... we have worked closely together... it was an easy conversation...we are finding lots of areas of agreement and cooperation...we know that Brazil will fully sympathise with what India is concerned about,"" Tharoor said, referring to Brazil’s solidarity on the issue.

He underlined the lack of accountability in Pakistan following the Pahalgam attack and added that the delegation’s mission was to “seek greater sympathy and understanding” globally for India’s counter-terror strategy.""The reason we have come is very much to seek greater sympathy and understanding on the part of our friends... for the situations in the recent months, in particular the really serious attack on the country by terrorists in Kashmir,"" Tharoor noted, while also expressing gratitude for President Lula da Silva’s personal condolence call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Following their high-level diplomatic meetings, the delegation also held discussions with the India-Brazil Friendship Front, headed by Senator Nelsinho Trad, and with senior officials including Ambassador Maria Laura da Rocha, Secretary General of Foreign Affairs.The Indian delegation includes MPs from various parties: Shambhavi Chaudhary (LJP), Sarfaraz Ahmed (JMM), G M Harish Balayogi (TDP), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, Bhubaneswar Kalita (all BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), Milind Deora (Shiv Sena), and former Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation to Brazil.

SC seeks Union’s response; plea challenges ‘push back’

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a petition by a man alleging that his mother, released after detention of three years following a Foreigner Tribunal identifying her as a Bangladeshi, may have been forcibly pushed into Bangladesh despite her plea against the tribunal’s order pending in SC since 2017.Appearing for Iunuch Ali, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and A G Masih that she was picked up by Dhubri police and allegedly pushed back into Bangladesh.“How can the Dhubri SP determine whether she is a Bangladeshi immigrant? Was she produced before a magistrate after being detained? The son does not know her whereabouts. The Centre must inform him about her whereabouts,” Sibal said. SC issued notice to Centre on this plea.Sibal also questioned the ‘push back’ of illegal Bangladeshi migrants and this is unknown to the process of law. He said the only legal process available is ‘deportation’. The petitioner said, “The law does not recognize push back, i.e arresting foreign nationals and taking them to the international border and either casting them away or pushing them across international borders without any verification and acceptance by the authorities of the other country.This is illegal, not permitted by any law.”Petitioner's mother Monowara Bewa was declared a foreigner by Dhubri Foreigners Tribunal on March 17, 2016. The Gauhati HC upheld the tribunal’s order on Feb 28, 2017. Her appeal against the HC order is pending adjudication in the SC for the last eight years.In the meantime, the SC in another case in 2019 ordered that foreigners cannot be kept in detention indefinitely and must be either deported to their native country or released on bail. The Centre had said that deportation is dependent on the host country accepting their citizen. Based on this 2019 judgment, Bewa was released in Dec 2019.She was detained again on May 24, as the drive against illegal Bangladeshi immigrants picked pace after the terror attack on tourists at Pahalgam and the ‘Op Sindoor’ by Indian armed forces against terrorist bases in Pakistan. The petitioner said her detention was in violation of her rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution.","SC seeks Union’s response; plea challenges ‘push back’ of illegal Bangladeshi migrants.

NEW DELHI: The death of a 9-year-old Dalit girl after a brutal rape in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur has triggered outrage across the country. As allegations of medical negligence and administrative failure emerge, here are 10 things to know about the case that has prompted interventions from the NHRC, NCW, and national leaders:On May 26, the minor girl was allegedly lured with chocolate near her aunt’s house and taken to a maize field where she was raped and physically assaulted. She sustained serious neck and internal injuries.She was first admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur. Due to her critical condition, she was referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on May 30.According to her uncle, the child was kept waiting for 2-3 hours inside an ambulance outside PMCH before being admitted. Despite her condition, proper care was allegedly delayed, and the family claims she was only admitted after they raised a ruckus.The family alleged that doctors gave the child sedatives through the night, and she died the next morning. They also claimed they had to spend Rs 25,000 at the government hospital.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took suo motu cognisance and issued notices to the chief secretary and DGP of Bihar, calling the incident a serious human rights violation.A detailed report has been sought within two weeks.National Commission for Women (NCW) Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar also took suo motu cognisance, demanding a probe into the role of the hospital authorities and police, and calling the delay in treatment ""gross negligence.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government of prioritising elections over justice.

LeT ultras boast about revenge for 1971, mock 'Modi's missiles & bullets'

NEW DELHI: The line, ever so thin, between the Pakistani state and terrorists, is fast disappearing post-Operation Sindoor. Speaker of Pakistan's Punjab assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, has now come out in defence of Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri, by attending a rally alongside the US-designated terrorist, and Talha Saeed, son of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed Asked by reporters, the speaker of the assembly of Pakistan's biggest province brazened it out by saying Kasuri, one of the masterminds of the Pahalgam terror attack , should not be seen as an accused without an investigation. He also cited a personal connection to Kasur, the town where the May 28 rally was organised.The presence of Talha alongside Kasuri came to light when foreign policy circles were already discussing Kasuri and his jihadi comrades gloating over what they called their success in avenging the partition of Pakistan after its loss to India in the 1971 war.Video footage from the rally showed Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri arriving with a posse of guards carrying American M4 carbines and being serenaded as the ""conqueror"" of India.

Congress has slammed Centre's move to send all-party delegations abroad, calling it a sham.""When on mission against terrorism, to carry India's message to the world, it's distressing that people at home are calculating political allegiances. Is it so difficult to be patriotic?"" he wondered in a post on X that appeared to echo the exasperation of his colleague Shashi Tharoor, who has been at the receiving end of attacks from party spokespersons for agreeing to head one of the all-party delegations.Explaining his post, Khurshid said the need of the hour is to speak in a single voice in favour of the country, irrespective of party affiliations, as the delegations have been doing on foreign soil. ""When I say, is it so difficult to be a patriot? - that is the question that has to be asked of those who are putting out tweets and saying things that I believe are not very encouraging when you want to do something for the nation,"" he wrote.Khurshid's remarks Friday backing abrogation of Article 370 while addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia had caused a stir. He had said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to J&K following the decision - something that is diametrically opposed to Congress' official stance of revocation of special status for J&K being a disaster.Sharing Khurshid's remarks on Monday, BJP stepped up its attack on Congress. ""Congress, for the sake of petty political gains, puts party interest, parivaar interest above national interest. Hope they will realise that Salman Khurshid is not a super pravakta (spokesperson) of any party, he is putting nation first.

As another example, Mehbooba cited a resolution in the assembly against the Centre’s Waqf law revisions that she claimed was “sabotaged” by the Omar-led govt. The PDP chief claimed she had written to the CM on the issue of Pandits but he didn’t respond.Omar’s party scoffed at the allegations and accused Mehbooba of “getting close to BJP”, which has long highlighted the plight of Pandits.“The issue of rehabilitation of Kashmiri pandits is not new. Why didn’t she meet LG in the past five years?” NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq asked.Mehbooba argued that the return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri pandits was not only the responsibility of the elected govt but of other parties, too. “It is a moral imperative and a societal responsibility to ensure that our Pandit brothers and sisters, who were tragically displaced from their homeland, are provided with the opportunity to return in a manner that is dignified, secure and sustainable,” the PDP chief said.The memorandum handed to the LG had also been mailed to CM Omar and Union home minister Amit Shah, Mehbooba said. The return of Pandits is not merely a demographic or administrative concern but a matter of historical justice, reconciliation and restoration of Kashmir’s pluralistic ethos.According to the PDP chief, Pandit families whose original homes exist but are dilapidated or semi-damaged should be provided financial grants or interest-free loans for repairs. “Reintegration must be both materially grounded and socially sustainable, requiring a multi-tiered and inclusive approach,” Mehbooba said.The PDP chief said she also took with the LG the issue of Kashmiri political prisoners, who do not face any serious charges, and sought their release.",Mehbooba Mufti met Lt Governor Manoj Sinha Monday for the first time since abrogation of Article 370.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the drone attack on Russia will “continue” unless Moscow halts its offensive.Speaking to reporters after the latest round of US-brokered peace talks in Istanbul on Monday, Zelenskyy hailed the drone strike and described it as a “strategic operation” that weakened Russia’s military capability. The attack, which targeted Russia’s strategic bomber fleet, took place just a day before the talks.“This is happening on daily basis,” Zelenskyy said, referring to Russia’s ongoing assaults, including a recent overnight attack using more than 480 drones. “Unless they will stop, we will continue.”When asked whether the drone operation would shift the dynamics of the war or provoke Russia, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was not concerned about whether Russia is “enraged,” stressing that Moscow continues its attacks regardless.Zelenskyy also addressed the role of the US in the peace process. “We are looking for very strong steps on the part of President Trump to support the sanctions and to force President Putin to stop this war, or at least proceed with the first stage of putting an end to this war — that is the ceasefire,” he said.Monday’s meeting in Istanbul marked the first direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian delegations since May 2022.The talks, held at Istanbul’s Ciragan Palace, lasted just over an hour.Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov confirmed that both sides agreed to exchange all severely wounded and ill prisoners of war, as well as the bodies of thousands of fallen soldiers. They also discussed the possibility of a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin Ukraine is calling for a 30-day ceasefire to create space for peace negotiations. However, Russia has rejected the proposal, with President Putin sticking to the same broad war goals he declared at the start of the invasion.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the drone strike as a “strategic operation” The attack, which targeted Russia’s strategic bomber fleet, took place just a day before the talks.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently predicted up to 10 hurricanes for this year's season.A department of homeland Security spokesperson clarified that the remark was intended as humour, affirming Fema's hurricane preparedness. They stated that under Secretary Kristi Noem and Richardson's leadership, Fema is transitioning to a streamlined disaster response organisation that enables states to provide citizen relief.During the briefing, Richardson indicated there would be no modifications to existing disaster response protocols, despite previous communications to staff about a new plan in May, sources informed Reuters.The timing of Richardson's remarks has heightened existing concerns about FEMA's storm season readiness, given recent senior staff departures, workforce reductions, and decreased hurricane preparations.Democratic leaders responded critically. Senate leader Chuck Schumer posted on X, questioning why Richardson remains in position. ""And I’m unaware of why he hasn’t been fired yet.""

Representative Bennie Thompson issued a statement to Reuters saying: ""Suffice to say, disaster response is no joke.

Departure from the White House

Road ahead for Katie Miller







Katie Miller, a seasoned political advisor and communications strategist, has officially departed the White House alongside Elon Musk following the end of their roles as special government employees. Miller, who previously served as an advisor and spokeswoman for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is now set to work for him full-time. Her transition marks a significant move in Musk’s continued involvement in U.S. policy and government reform initiatives, especially after his highly publicized 130-day stint in Washington, D.C. Miller’s influence in both political and tech circles has made her a central figure in the DOGE initiative.Katie Miller is married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, according to insiders cited by WIRED. Katie, who served as the spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will now work full-time for Musk. Meanwhile, social media has been rife with rumours speculating that Katie left her husband Stephen Miller for Elon Musk, suggesting the three were involved in a “throuple” during Musk’s time at the White House.Katie acted as the crucial link between Musk and the administration, often delivering bad news to him, while she and Stephen also helped navigate Musk through Washington. Rumors suggest Stephen Miller “used” his wife as Musk’s handler and bragged about controlling Musk, though these remain unconfirmed. A senior Republican strategist described Katie as a powerful figure who “leaves bodies everywhere she’s been.” Despite Musk’s exit signalling possible tensions with Trump, some Republicans like Vice President JD Vance believe Musk’s political influence will continue, cautioning that the “Elon era” is far from over.Katie Miller holds a BA from the University of Florida and a Master of Public Policy from George Washington University. She began her political career as a press assistant for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, later serving as press secretary for Senator Steve Daines and spokeswoman for Senator Martha McSally. In 2017, she joined the Department of Homeland Security as deputy press secretary, where she defended the Trump administration’s family separation policy. She went on to serve as press secretary and then communications director for Vice President Mike Pence, becoming a key figure in Republican communications.In December 2024, Donald Trump announced Miller’s appointment to the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where she became a close advisor to Elon Musk. According to WIRED, she was a key intermediary between DOGE and the rest of the White House, responsible for delivering daily messaging and managing Musk’s political communication.Miller’s responsibilities grew to include coordinating Musk’s media appearances, particularly around SpaceX’s Starship launch and broader tech policy. Her influence in DOGE was described as ""pivotal"" by insiders, and she helped shape Musk’s messaging and manage sensitive government interactions.Musk’s tenure as a special government employee ended in May 2025 after 130 days, and Miller’s term concluded alongside his. Following their departure, CBS News confirmed that Miller would continue working for Musk full-time, leading communications across his ventures. Her shift to the private sector marks a new phase in their professional collaboration.Katie Miller's unique role bridging government policy and technological innovation positions her as an influential figure in both political and tech worlds. As Musk plans to step back from political spending and re-evaluate his role in public policy, Miller’s communications acumen will likely continue to play a major role in shaping the public narrative around Musk’s ventures.Her next chapter, outside of government but still within the realm of high-stakes influence, will be closely watched as Musk’s enterprises continue to blur the line between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.","Katie Miller has officially departed the White House alongside Elon Musk.

Gnanasekaran, convicted for the Anna University rape, had previously attempted a similar assault but was interrupted. Crucial evidence, including call records showing a 143-minute window of flight mode during the crime, forensic analysis, and the victim's testimony, led to his conviction.





CHENNAI: A day before the Dec 23, 2024, rape on Anna University (AU) campus, the sole convict, A Gnanasekaran, had targeted another girl student and tried to sexually assault her in a similar manner. His attempt on Dec 22, 2024, however, failed as a university staff member happened to pass by, prompting Gnanasekaran to pretend as if he was merely scolding her.The girl, and her boyfriend, who were cornered by him in an isolated location on the campus, came forward to testify against Gnanasekaran in the trial court. Though they fumbled in identifying him during the test identification parade, both confirmed his role later and told the court that it was out of fear that they did not identify him.Their deposition, along with other clinching evidence such as Airtel call records, forensic analysis of Gnanasekaran's mobile phone, and the victim's courtroom statement confirming that no ringtone was heard during a 143-minute window on Dec 23, 2024, proved critical in ensuring a life sentence for Gnanasekaran.Investigators found that Gnanasekaran, who used an Airtel SIM, had made his last call at 6.29pm on Dec 23.He then switched his phone to flight mode until 8.52pm. During this window — the exact time when the crime took place — there were no incoming or outgoing calls or messages. Airtel submitted this data in court and confirmed the phone's status.Kotturpuram assistant commissioner Bharathiraja, who led the investigation, said the phone seizure proved decisive. After the girl's complaint, police drew up a list of known usual suspects in the area and zeroed in on Gnanasekaran within 24 hours.""His unusual gait captured on CCTV near the crime scene was a key lead, supported by mobile location data, that led to his arrest,"" said Bharathiraja, whose team had submitted more than 200 pages of evidence, including prior offences with a similar pattern.As for the possibility of the involvement of more people in the rape, special public prosecutor Mary Jayanthi said, ""there was no other ‘sir' as alleged. The evidence was clear"". The opposition parties had earlier raised slogans asking, ""Who is that sir?"" in reference to this claim.Meanwhile, Gnanasekaran's counsel argued that the 30-year term without remission violates his constitutional rights. He said they would file an appeal against the verdict.","A Gnanasekaran, convicted for the Anna University rape, had previously attempted a similar assault but was interrupted.

AI drones operate without human control

Strategic impact extends beyond immediate damage

Ukraine has deployed artificial intelligence-powered autonomous drones to attack Russian military aircraft across multiple airbases, marking a significant escalation in the use of AI technology in warfare. The operation, codenamed ""Spider's Web,"" reportedly damaged over 40 Russian bomber aircraft , including strategic Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3 long-range bombers.The coordinated strikes targeted Russian airfields spanning thousands of kilometers, from facilities near Moscow to bases in eastern Siberia and the Far East. SBU sources who spoke to the BBC said the 18-month operation involved concealing explosive drones inside wooden mobile cabins mounted on trucks, which were positioned near Russian airfields before launching remotely.Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov confirmed the first combat use of the country's AI-powered ""mother drone"" system, developed by Ukraine's defense tech cluster Brave1. The system can deliver two AI-guided first-person view strike drones up to 300 kilometers behind enemy lines.The AI-powered drones utilized advanced autonomous systems that function independently once deployed. Reports indicate the technology includes ""mother ship"" drones capable of delivering smaller first-person view (FPV) strike drones up to 300 kilometers behind enemy lines. These systems employ visual-inertial navigation with cameras and LiDAR technology, allowing them to identify and engage targets without GPS dependency or human intervention.The SmartPilot system enables the drones to process real-time video data through AI algorithms, autonomously locating high-value targets including aircraft, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure. Each operation reportedly costs approximately $10,000, about the cost of 10 iPhone 16 Pros, significantly less expensive than conventional missile strikes, which can cost 300 to 500 times more, according to reports.The operation targeted strategic missile-carrying bombers including Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 aircraft, which are no longer in production and difficult to replace. Military analysts suggest the strike affected approximately 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet at key airbases, representing billions of dollars in potential damage.Ukraine's defense tech cluster Brave1 developed the drone systems as part of the country's broader strategy to offset disadvantages in manpower and firepower through technological innovation.","Ukraine has successfully deployed AI-powered drones in a large-scale operation, codenamed ""Spider's Web,"" targeting Russian military aircraft.

Producers move Karnataka HC against KFCC ban on Kamal Haasan's new film,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/producers-move-karnataka-hc-against-kfcc-ban-on-kamal-haasans-new-film/articleshow/121586178.cms,"Producers move Karnataka HC against KFCC ban on Kamal Haasan's new film





BENGALURU: Chennai-based producers of Kamal Haasan-starrer 'Thug Life', set to hit the screens Thursday, on Monday filed a petition before Karnataka high court, challenging the ban imposed by Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce on the movie's release in the state.The petitioner has sought a restraint order against KFCC and adequate security to producers, cast and other associated persons. The high court will take up the petition for hearing on Tuesday.The KFCC announced the ban on May 30 following the actor's remarks that 'Kannada is born from Tamil'.Raajkamal Films International, the petitioner, said the ground for the KFCC ban is based not on the contents of the movie, but on alleged personal remarks made by Kamal Haasan , the lead actor in the film. It argued that the action of KFCC in issuing a press release or public declarations announcing a ban is arbitrary and illegal.KFCC president M Narasimhalu told a news agency they will not allow the movie's screening unless the actor offers an apology, and confirmed that film distributors were awaiting a conversation with Haasan. ""We will respond after reviewing court developments,"" he added. Reports suggested South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce has reached out to Kamal Haasan to resolve the situation.In the high court, the movie producers claimed Central Board of Film Certification has issued a certificate under Cinematograph Act. Hence, the ban infringes upon fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g).It further argued that 'Thug Life' has no characters, dialogues or opinions on the relationship between the two languages.Mandya MLA Ravikumar Ganiga Monday said Ooty and Hosur were once part of the erstwhile Mysore state. Though now in Tamil Nadu, these areas historically belong to Karnataka and should be merged back, he said.The MLA criticised what he described as a pattern of disregard from Tamil Nadu toward Karnataka's interests.",Chennai-based producers of Kamal Haasan-starrer 'Thug Life' on Monday filed a petition before Karnataka high court.

Iowa Senator Joni Ernst defended her controversial statement ""we all are going to die,"" at a town hall meeting and said that ""you need to listen to the entire conversation.""Speaking to CBS News on Monday, Ernst said, ""I'm very compassionate, and you need to listen to the entire conversation.""During a heated town hall on Friday, Senator Joni Ernst sparked viral attention with remarks about mortality as she defended a controversial GOP-backed domestic policy bill. The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill act—a nod to former President Trump's nickname for it—seeks to implement work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients, among other reforms.Tensions rose when Ernst attempted to explain the proposed changes to Medicaid, prompting someone in the crowd to shout that the policy would lead to deaths.Ernst elaborated that the legislation would ""focus on those that are most vulnerable"" and assured that ""those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid we will protect.""Subsequently, Ernst posted an ironic video apology on Instagram, stating, ""I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth. So, I apologize. I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the Tooth Fairy as well.""Her remarks drew criticism from potential electoral challengers. Democratic nominee candidate Nathan Sage accused Ernst of showing contempt for constituents, whilst State Representative JD Scholten announced his campaign launch, citing Ernst's town hall behaviour as motivation.The House legislation would implement additional Medicaid restrictions, including requirements for non-disabled adults without children to work, volunteer or study. It also introduces more frequent eligibility assessments, reduces funding for states covering undocumented immigrants, freezes provider taxes and prohibits gender transition service coverage.The proposed modifications to Medicaid and SNAP could generate substantial savings, potentially funding extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and enhanced border security measures.Ernst acknowledged at the town hall that whilst she supports certain aspects of the House-passed legislation, ""the bill will be changing"" as it progresses through the Senate, where some Republicans advocate for reduced Medicaid cuts.","Iowa Senator Joni Ernst defended her controversial statement ""we all are going to die,"" at a town hall meeting and said that ""you need to listen to the entire conversation"" The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill act, seeks to implement work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121586033,imgsize-45878,width-400,resizemode-4/121586033.jpg"
Trump shuts down proposal to allow Iran's civilian nuclear enrichment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-shuts-down-proposal-to-allow-irans-civilian-nuclear-enrichment/articleshow/121583529.cms,"US President Donald Trump

Trump Allows Iran Limited Nuclear Uranium Enrichment Under New Proposal - Axios





US President Donald Trump on Monday seems to have rejected a proposal from his special envoy to Iran that would have allowed Tehran to retain low-level uranium enrichment for civilian purposes. Trump insisted that any deal to ease US sanctions must require Iran to fully dismantle its nuclear enrichment program.“Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” Trump posted on social media but there is no clarification whether he was talking about the proposal or not.Trump’s stance appeared to contradict recent efforts by his envoy, Steve Witkoff, who had reportedly offered Iran the option to continue limited enrichment for uses like nuclear medicine and power, in exchange for shutting down its heavily fortified underground sites.The proposal also included a regional consortium to oversee civilian uranium enrichment, a concept dating back to negotiations around the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Tehran has denied it is seeking nuclear weapons but has refused to consider any deal that completely ends its enrichment activities. The US and Iran have recently held several rounds of direct nuclear talks, the first in years, as Trump has framed a deal as the best way to avoid military conflict.The latest proposal reportedly included significant concessions that could provoke strong opposition from Israel and pro-Israel lawmakers in Washington. Trump had sharply criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement and withdrew the US from it in 2017 during his first term.",US President Donald Trump seems to have rejected a proposal from his special envoy to Iran.
