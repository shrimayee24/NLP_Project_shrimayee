Charlie Kirk's Murder Triggers Nationalist Protest In London; Tommy Robinson's Rally Turns Violent

Poll Do you believe that the UK government should take stricter measures against illegal immigration? Yes, absolutely No, it should be more lenient

Anti-migrant focus



Flags and slogans







London’s streets turned into a stage for Britain’s anxieties on Saturday, as far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. Tens of thousands of people marched, leading to sporadic clashes with police.The marchers came to London by train and coach for what was called a ""festival of free speech,"" but speeches during the event spread racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim comments across Whitehall, The Guardian reported.Police said some officers were punched, kicked, and hit by bottles thrown from the edges of the ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. More than 1,000 officers were deployed, with reinforcements in helmets and riot shields sent in when needed, as per a report by news agency Associated Press.According to police, the crowd count was estimated at 1,10,000 to 1,50,000 people, much larger than expected. However, it was still smaller than the pro-Palestinian march in November 2023 that drew a crowd count of about 300,000 people.A rival protest, the ""March Against Fascism"" organized by Stand Up To Racism, attracted a crowd count of around 5,000 participants.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the English Defense League and is one of the most prominent far-right figures in Britain.The march was presented as a defense of free speech. However, much of the messaging from speakers, including far-right politicians from Europe, centered on migration.""We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture, you and we are being colonized by our former colonies,"" French politician Eric Zemmour said.Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and owner of X, joined by video and criticized the UK government. ""There’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion, but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration,"" he said.Robinson told the crowd that migrants had more rights in court than the ""British public, the people that built this nation.""The rallies come amid political debate in the UK over migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats without authorization. This summer saw several anti-migrant protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers, following the conviction of an Ethiopian man for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in London. Some of these protests turned violent and led to arrests.At the ""Unite the Kingdom"" march, participants carried St George’s flags and the union jack and chanted ""we want our country back.""Flags have become more common across the UK in recent months, with some viewing them as national pride and others as a sign of growing nationalism.Protesters held placards saying ""stop the boats,"" ""send them home,"" and ""enough is enough, save our children.""Counter-protesters carried signs that read ""refugees welcome"" and ""smash the far right,"" while chanting ""stand up, fight back.""Robinson’s supporters also shouted crude remarks about UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and expressed support for slain US conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally.

Moscow on Sunday praised its longstanding relationship with Delhi, describing it as “reliable and steadily progressing” and warning that any effort to disrupt the partnership is “destined to fail. ”The Russian foreign ministry welcomed India’s commitment to continue and expand multifaceted cooperation with Russia, despite pressure from US President Donald Trump to impose US-like tariffs on Indian goods for continuing to buy Russian oil.Officials added that “frankly, anything else would be hard to imagine,” as quoted by RT International.The ministry highlighted that New Delhi’s approach, despite Western criticism, reflects “the spirit and traditions of long-standing Russia-India friendship” and embodies what it called “strategic autonomy in international affairs.”Moscow emphasised that the partnership between Russia and India is based on “the highest value of sovereignty and the primacy of national interests,” making the relationship “reliable, predictable and truly strategic in nature.”Officials noted that the two countries are engaged in large-scale joint projects across various fields, including civilian and military production, manned space missions, nuclear power, and Indian investments in Russian oil exploration projects.The ministry also highlighted ongoing cooperation on payment systems, expanding the use of national currencies, and creating alternative transport and logistics routes. These initiatives are described as long-term efforts and not merely a response to “unfavorable geopolitical realities.”The comments come amid rising tensions with the United States, which last month imposed unprecedented duties on most Indian products, including an initial 25% tariff and an additional 25% “penalty” for Indian purchases of Russian oil and defense equipment.US officials claimed India’s energy imports from Russia have indirectly fueled the Ukraine conflict. India rejected these accusations, calling Washington’s move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.”The US measures also followed stalled efforts to reach a bilateral trade deal. While officials confirmed this week that negotiations have restarted, earlier reports suggested India was refusing to give concessions on agriculture and dairy, areas it regards as “very big red lines.”","Russian foreign ministry welcomes India's commitment to continue cooperation with Russia.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells.

T'puram: In a first in India, Kerala cabinet Saturday cleared a draft bill to amend Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, authorising the chief wildlife warden to order the killing of any wild animal that attacks and injures a person in a residential area.The move comes amid a series of reports of man-animal conflicts in recent months. ""The central govt and National Tiger Conservation Authority issued an SOP on Jan 30, 2013, detailing how to handle tigers that enter human habitats. Guidelines for handling elephants are also in place. These impractical provisions in the central law and the SOP act as obstacles to killing dangerous wild animals even in emergency situations. This is why the state govt has introduced the amendment bill,"" forest minister A K Saseendran said.The bill also allows the regulation of animal populations listed in Schedule II of the Act and their relocation to other areas, without requiring central govt approval.","Kerala cabinet Saturday cleared a draft bill to amend Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

Ex-Tibetan PM in exile says Chinese embassies meddling in Nepal; warns India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-tibetan-pm-in-exile-says-chinese-embassies-meddling-in-nepal-warns-india/articleshow/123870939.cms,"China, India To Ink New Border Deal At SCO Summit? Envoy Drops Bombshell | Watch

NEW DELHI: Chinese Embassy officials of interfering directly in the local affairs of South Asian countries, particularly in Nepal, former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay claimed, and also warned India to be vigilant about its dealings with Beijing.In an conversation at ANI podcast, Sangay voiced concern over China’s “expansionist” policies and its efforts to “checkmate” India’s influence in the region.Asked whether India, like some Southeast Asian nations, avoids the Tibet issue to preserve ties with Beijing, Sangay replied that he did not believe India followed that approach, but stressed that “China is systematically working” to curb New Delhi’s reach.""India has a bigger stake with China,"" Sangay said. ""Just look at not just Tibet, not just the border area. Look at all the neighbouring countries. In Southeast Asia or Central Asia, wherever India wants to have its influence or relationship, China is always there to checkmate.""Using Nepal as an example, he alleged that Chinese officials had become “the most powerful” players in Kathmandu, “perhaps more powerful than the Indian or American embassies.”He said similar patterns of interference were visible in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “They come and interfere and influence. I don’t want to say they control you, but they come inside your own house,” he said.""And the larger point that you raised about, you know, in Asia, how many people will take up the issue of Tibet because they don't want to have conflict with China, which is a fact on the one hand. On the other hand, what we say is that what happened to Tibet will happen to you. So if you don't understand and study Tibet, it will happen to you,"" he added.He pointed to Nepal as a clear example of Chinese political overreach. ""Let's say Nepal -- they didn't believe so, right? Now, yes, the Chinese embassy and the officials are interfering in local issues,"" he said. ""The Chinese Embassy, perhaps, some of my friends say, is the most powerful in Kathmandu -- more powerful than the Indian Embassy or American Embassy. Some say that.""He highlighted China's full physical control over Tibet and its current approach in other countries. ""The difference is the physical control of Tibet,"" Sangay said. ""Other than that, political influence of the Chinese government -- and through the embassies -- in all these neighbouring countries and all these Asian countries is a fact.""He also framed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Tibet as strategic signals aimed at India, noting the region’s shared border and China’s large military deployment there. While transcripts of Xi’s latest speech to troops were not released—coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Beijing—Sangay said he was “sure” it echoed previous calls to “prepare for war or incursion” against India.Reflecting on his own experience, Sangay described how Tibetans had found a temporary home in India after fleeing their homeland. “As a Buddhist, we believe in impermanence. Once you lose your country, you’re nomadic,” he said, adding that India became “our home” after Tibetans fled. Although he now lives in the United States, he said he feels an enduring cultural bond with India: “As soon as I come out of Indira Gandhi Airport, when you smell the Delhi air… for your mind, it’s just calming. ”He stressed that ties between Tibetans and Indians remain strong. “Whenever I meet Indians, I immediately say Namaskar… immediately, you become friends.”Sangay also recalled how, during his tenure from 2011 to 2021, Chinese pressure often accompanied periods of India–China rapprochement. He cited the 2018 “Thank You India” event planned by the Tibetan administration, which was scaled back after India reportedly advised officials to avoid participation in the midst of efforts to ease tensions with Beijing.Despite such episodes, Sangay emphasised India’s consistent support. ""No matter which party or which person becomes Prime Minister, India has always treated Tibetans well. We cannot think of any better host for Tibetans,"" he said, adding that the preservation of Tibetan identity, education, and religious institutions has been possible due to India's support.","Former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay spoke to ANI podcast.

Charlie Kirk Assassin’s Motive: FBI Uncovers Tyler Robinson’s Hateful Motive Behind Killing Kirk

Who is Lance Twiggs ?







The assassination of 31-year-old Charlie Kirk, known to be openly transphobic, took a new turn Saturday as it was revealed that the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, has a trans partner . The Daily Mail revealed the name of the trans partner -- transforming from a man to a woman -- as Lance Twiggs. According to the report, Twiggs lived with Tyler Robinson in a three-bedroom apartment in Saint George, Utah.Twiggs is the person who received text messages from Tyler after the shooting about stashing a gun. Twiggs' grandfather Jerry Twiggs told Daily Mail that he was unable to comment on rumours that Twiggs is trans and there was a transgender motive to Kirk's murder. He also said he never met Robinson but he confirmed that his grandchild had been talking with the police.Authorities are yet to confirm a motive, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox told the Wall Street Journal that Robinson was, 'deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology'.South Utah native, Twiggs, studied at Utah Tech University, according to his Facebook page. Robinson, 22, was also taking electrician training at a nearby technical college. Like Tyler, Twiggs is also an avid gamer. He posted himself on social media playing popular games including Apex Legends, Valorant and Rocket League.Other comical videos he shared included adding spaghetti to an Italian sandwich and microwaving a bottle of Mountain Dew. Friends told the Daily Mail that Robinson and Twiggs were part of a large group chat of dozens of gamer friends mostly from Robinson’s alma mater, Pine View High School, hosted on online chat network Discord.Twiggs, however, has not been named in the affidavit that the police filed supporting the murder, obstruction and felony firearm charges against Robinson. ""The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique,"" the affidavit said. ""Messages from the contact Tyler also mention that he had changed outfits.""","The Daily Mail revealed the name of the trans partner -- transforming from a man to a woman -- as Lance Twiggs.

Apartment searched, digital evidence seized







The partner of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating US President Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk, is cooperating fully with investigators and had no knowledge of the alleged plan, senior FBI officials told Fox News Digital.Robinson, who lived in St George, Utah, shared an apartment with the individual, described by officials as a male transitioning to female. The FBI confirmed the two were in a romantic relationship.One FBI official said the partner has been “extremely cooperative,” stressing that the person “had no idea” Robinson was planning to target Kirk. The partner has not been accused of any wrongdoing, according to Fox News.Investigators revealed they obtained text messages and communications between Robinson and the partner, which helped them identify Robinson as the suspect. Agents also seized computers and other evidence from the couple’s apartment, which has been sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico for analysis.While the Bureau declined to say whether Robinson’s partner could face charges, a spokesperson emphasised the scale of the probe.“The FBI is investigating a record number of tips. Every connection, every group, every link will be investigated, and anyone involved in this matter, anywhere in the world they might be, will be brought to justice,"" the spokesperson told Fox News.The apartment is located in the same southern Utah community where Robinson’s parents live, about four hours from Utah Valley University in Orem.

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism



""Last night’s moment was the league’s decision. It’s up to the clubs for this Sunday’s games,""

""There have been moments following school shootings or an attack on a house of worship such as the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. There also have been moments following major international incidents such as Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and weather-related incidents such as major hurricanes and fires,""

The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe, on the other hand, stirred controversy on BlueSky this week after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Kluwe, who earlier this year lost his job as a high school football coach for calling the MAGA movement “Nazi,” posted a profanity-laced message backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democratic rhetoric had fueled the attack. In his post, Kluwe argued that Republicans are responsible for the hostile climate, writing that they “could stop it at any time” and shouldn’t be treated like “children. ”The NFL addressed its tribute to Charlie Kirk in a statement released Friday, noting that teams will decide for themselves whether to observe a similar gesture on Sunday. During Thursday night’s matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders, the league held a moment of silence for Kirk before kickoff.the statement read, according to multiple reports.The league explained the decision by pointing to its history of holding moments of silence after tragedies or significant losses.the statement continued. It added that tributes have also honored figures within the NFL family, from Damar Hamlin to Kobe Bryant, and reflected on changes to pre-game protocols after the death of George Floyd.Outside football, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence before their Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers. Trump later appeared at Yankee Stadium during a separate 9/11 ceremony.","Green Bay Packers and NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field.

FBI director Kash Patel was called cringe and a dork for his message for Charlie Kirk at the FBI press conference on Friday, where the agency revealed the name of Kirk's shooter and the details of how the FBI nabbed him after a failed attempt. ""To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother.

It refers to the 'Hall of the Slain', an enormous hall located in Asgard ruled by the god Odin. In Norse mythology, it is believed that warriors who die bravely in battle are chosen by Odin and enter Valhalla.Kash Patel came under fire in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's death, as the FBI got the wrong person initially, whom they let out after they realized he was not the shooter. Patel was called incompetent for the major confusion and now the social media is up in arms over his 'valhalla' comment.""Indian guy saying that he’ll see a Christian in Valhalla is some confused theology,"" one wrote. Many jumped into Patel's defense saying that it's a common saying in military apart from the Valhalla part.""We don’t believe in valhalla you dork. this is so not the time or place to be cute,"" one wrote.One commenter noted that the FBI played no role in apprehending Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing, as he was turned in by his father.

Robinson’s background and ideology





Tyler Robinson, accused of killing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, appeared to have a fixation on the “furry” subculture, according to social media activity.An account on the website FurAffinity.net, known for sexualised cartoon animal characters, matched a username Robinson reportedly used on gaming and online platforms, friends told the Daily Mail.Investigators also discovered a cartridge believed to belong to the murder weapon inscribed with the phrase, “Notices, bulges, OwO what’s this?” — a line associated with a popular furry meme.Robinson’s 22-year-old roommate and romantic partner, Lance Twiggs, is an aspiring professional gamer who is transitioning from male to female.In a 2022 Reddit post, Twiggs wrote, “We are riding with Biden on this glorious subreddit.” The comment appeared on a satirical thread that also included the remark, “One day Jeb will be president and America will fully reform into a utopia.”In another post, Twiggs noted, “I have been getting recommended treatments for schizophrenia, bpd, and a brain tumor recently by my social media advertisements. this meme is perfect, thanks.”Law enforcement sources told Axios that Twiggs was “aghast” after learning of Robinson’s alleged crimes and has been “extremely cooperative” with authorities.“It’s pretty clear that Robinson’s roommate knew a lot and didn’t say anything after the killing, so they’re a person of interest officially and are cooperating. We want to keep it that way,” one official said.Twiggs reportedly told investigators, “That’s what happened? Oh my God, no. Here are all the messages,” before handing over Robinson’s online communications.Robinson’s digital footprint revealed a mix of liberal ideology, gamer humor, and post-ironic memes. He reportedly grew up in the Mormon faith but had left the church long before the alleged crime.Federal and state law enforcement officials are also examining leftist groups in Utah to determine whether anyone had knowledge of Robinson’s alleged plans. At least one group, “Armed Queers Salt Lake City,” deleted its social media accounts in recent days, though it is unclear if this was connected to the investigation.Robinson is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. He faces charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and obstruction of justice.US President Donald Trump has called for the death penalty if Robinson is convicted.","Tyler Robinson, accused of killing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, appeared to have a fixation on the “furry” subculture, according to social media activity.

US President Donald Trump came to the defence of FBI director Kash Patel on Saturday, praising his handling of the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Trump's statement came amid Patel facing mounting criticism from within the bureau and from political allies.“I am very proud of the FBI,” Trump said in a brief interview with Fox News. “Kash — and everyone else — they have done a great job.”Republican governor Spencer Cox announced Friday that law enforcement had apprehended 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who has been ordered held without bail. Prosecutors are expected to file formal charges against him next week. Robinson is accused of fatally shooting Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, during a speech at Utah Valley University.Patel’s leadership has come under fire following a confusing sequence of updates he shared on social media earlier this week. On Wednesday, Patel initially announced that a “subject” was in law enforcement custody, only to later clarify, two hours afterwards, that the person had been released after questioning.The episode, coupled with lingering criticism over Patel’s handling of files connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has fueled doubts about his leadership among both former FBI officials and some Republicans who once championed his appointment.Despite the backlash, the White House strongly backed Patel’s work. “Director Patel and his team worked night and day to find this murderer and bring him to justice,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement to POLITICO.“Anyone who doubts his resolve and dedication — especially when Charlie was such a close friend to him — simply is using this extremely sad moment in a disgusting act of political gamesmanship. The focus was on catching this killer, and he will face the full wrath of the justice system,” Cheung added.Patel is scheduled to appear before Congress this week, where lawmakers are expected to press him on the investigation and the bureau’s handling of updates to the public.",US President Donald Trump came to the defence of FBI director Kash Patel on Saturday.

A senior officer said witnesses indicated Anamika might have been intoxicated but it could only be confirmed after the test results came.DCP Kalita, accompanied by Jadavpur police station officers and the surgeon who performed the autopsy, inspected the campus on Sunday. The officers measured the depth of the water body, which is next to the students union room, and the distance between it and the venue of the musical event on the campus that Anamika had attended before she died.Kalita said they had obtained CCTV footage that would help them determine the exact time, manner and cause of death. Police have seized Anamika’s mobile, which was handed over to her family by a professor after her death.Students present at the scene on Thursday night told reporters that they were alerted by shrieks of a girl who spotted two hands protruding out of the water.

'Calls For My Killing...': Nigel Farage Exposes Chilling 'Death Threats' After Charlie Kirk Murder





The US vice president JD Vance announced that he will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday to pay tribute to his slain friend.The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah.Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics. In a letter to Kirk shared after his death at Utah Valley University, Vance reflected on their time together.He noted that Kirk was one of the first people he contacted when he decided to run for the US Senate in 2021 and that Kirk helped connect him with others who could support his campaign, including Donald Trump Jr.Vance described Kirk as one of his most dedicated advocates over the years, who even helped guide the selection process that ultimately led to Vance becoming vice-president.The vice president said he first learned about Kirk being shot through group messages with friends and government officials while in a meeting in the West Wing.“God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” Vance wrote.Vance had also accompanied Kirk’s body during transport from Utah to his home state of Arizona.Images from the flight show Kirk’s wife, Erika, dressed in black and holding their two young children, walking hand-in-hand with second lady Usha Vance.

Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote. “Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, assisting with strategy, fundraising, and grassroots connections. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr., who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” he wrote.Kirk's children also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family and they often spent time together.“Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission. And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers,” Vance said.","US vice president JD Vance will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday.

Lavrov THUNDERS At U.S., Japan & South Korea After Meeting Kim Jong Un | ‘Don’t Even Think…’





The United States, South Korea, and Japan on Monday began a joint air and naval exercise off South Korea’s Jeju Island, in what they called their most advanced trilateral military drill to date. The exercise, named Freedom Edge, will run through Friday and is aimed at boosting cooperation across air, sea and cyber domains in response to North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats, South Korea’s defence ministry said, reported news agency AP.According to the US Indo-Pacific command, Freedom Edge includes ballistic missile defence, air-defence drills, medical evacuations, and maritime operations training. It will also involve aerial assets from the US marine corps and Air Force. The command described it as “the most advanced demonstration of trilateral defense cooperation to date.”The drills have drawn a strong response from North Korea, which has historically condemned joint military exercises by its regional rivals. In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said:“The reckless show of strength made by them in real action in the vicinity of the DPRK, which is the wrong place, will inevitably bring bad results to themselves,” as quoted by the agency.She also criticised the Iron Mace tabletop exercise held recently by the US and South Korea, which reportedly focuses on integrating US nuclear capabilities with South Korean conventional forces to deter North Korean threats. The two militaries have not officially confirmed details of that drill, which was reported to coincide with Freedom Edge.North Korea has previously responded to such exercises with missile launches or other military demonstrations. Talks between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington aimed at curbing the North’s weapons programme remain stalled.Kim Jong Un has instead moved closer to Russia and China, both of which have increased defence and diplomatic engagement with North Korea in recent months. Since the start of the Ukraine war, Kim has sent large quantities of artillery shells and ballistic missiles to Russia, according to Western intelligence claims.He also visited China earlier this month and appeared alongside President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a large-scale military parade.","The exercise, named Freedom Edge, will run through Friday and is aimed at boosting cooperation across air, sea and cyber domains.

‘Up to China’: Donald Trump leaves TikTok’s US ban in doubt; hints at a factor that could save app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/up-to-china-donald-trump-leaves-tiktoks-us-ban-in-doubt-hints-at-a-factor-that-could-save-app/articleshow/123889597.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP images)





US President Donald Trump on Sunday struck an ambiguous note on the future of TikTok, suggesting that China would ultimately decide the app’s fate just days ahead of a September 17 deadline for its parent company ByteDance to sell its US assets or face a ban.“We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know — it depends, up to China,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington.Trump has already pushed back the TikTok deadline three times since January. While lawmakers warn that the app poses national security risks, he has also credited it with helping him connect with younger voters during last year’s election.Last month, US President said that he had US buyers lined up for the app and signaled he could extend the deadline again. On Sunday, however, he sounded less certain. “It doesn’t matter too much. I’d like to do it for the kids. They like it,” he said.The president also pointed to TikTok’s role in his campaign outreach. “I did very well on TikTok, and I got the youth vote and I got numbers that nobody’s ever even come close to in the Republican Party,” he said.“Some was attributed to TikTok, and a lot was attributed to Charlie,” he added, referring to conservative activist Charlie Kirk who was assassinated on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.Sources suggest that the administration is likely to grant another extension rather than force a shutdown this week. Such a move would give more time for negotiations but could frustrate lawmakers in Congress who have pressed for a clear decision on the platform, as reported by news agency Reuters.Meanwhile, American and Chinese officials held talks in Madrid on Sunday, where TikTok was part of a broader trade agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top negotiator Li Chenggang.TikTok had not featured in earlier rounds of trade discussions in Geneva, London and Stockholm. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has chosen not to enforce the law requiring TikTok’s US assets to be sold or shut down. Instead, he has pushed back the deadline three times, first to April, then to June and most recently to September.With the deadline approaching, a final agreement is unlikely, leaving the platform’s future uncertain.",TikTok's parent company ByteDance has until September 17 to sell its US assets or face a ban.

Arrest followed family intervention



Governor: Suspect not cooperating







Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a campus event last week, is being held under “special watch” as officials carry out a mental health evaluation, authorities said Sunday.Robinson, who was taken into custody after a 33-hour manhunt, will remain in the Utah County sheriff’s department’s special housing unit “so that authorities can keep a close eye on him” until the evaluation is complete, the department said in a statement. The process could take several days.Once cleared, Robinson will move into the jail’s standard classification process to determine his permanent housing. “He will continue to be monitored by mental, medical, and custody staff throughout the duration of his stay,” the department added.Officials noted that “special watch” status is commonly applied for several reasons, including the nature of the crime, violent or erratic behaviour, and suicidal threats made during or after arrest. Authorities confirmed they were specifically alerted to suicidal comments or concerns regarding Robinson.Robinson allegedly opened fire on Kirk, 31, during a Turning Point USA event on Wednesday at Utah Valley University, killing the married father of two young children in front of an audience.The suspect’s arrest came after his father recognised him in FBI surveillance footage released during the manhunt. According to a law enforcement source cited by Fox News Digital, Robinson returned to his father’s home and said he wanted to kill himself. His father later consulted a minister before turning him in to the authorities.Utah governor Brian Cox said Sunday that Robinson has so far refused to cooperate with investigators.“He has not confessed to authorities. He is not cooperating, but all the people around him are cooperating. And I think that’s very important,” Cox told ABC News.The governor added that Robinson’s family members and his romantic partner, a man transitioning from male to female, are assisting investigators. He also noted that those close to the 22-year-old described him as being “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.”","Tyler Robinson, 22, is being held under “special watch” as officials carry out a mental health evaluation, authorities said Sunday.

Jim Edgar passes: Former Illinois governor dies at 79 from pancreatic cancer; diagnosed earlier this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jim-edgar-passes-former-illinois-governor-dies-at-79-from-pancreatic-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-this-year/articleshow/123888913.cms,"Former Illinois governor Jim Edgar dies at 79 (AP)





Former Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, a two-term Republican credited with guiding the state toward greater financial stability in the 1990s, died Sunday at the age of 79.Edgar passed away from complications related to his treatment for pancreatic cancer, which he publicly disclosed earlier this year.“We are deeply grateful for the love, support and kindness so many have shown to Jim and our family over these last several months,” his family said in a statement.Born in small-town Oklahoma, Edgar began his political career as a state legislator and later served as Illinois secretary of state for a decade. He was elected governor in 1990, a moderate Republican who easily won reelection, including in heavily Democratic Cook County, home to Chicago.At the time Edgar took office, Illinois faced hundreds of millions in debt and was paying bills months late. Amid a recession, he pushed legislators to cut the state budget, including layoffs and reductions in popular programs. He also fulfilled a campaign promise by making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, providing a stable source of funding for public schools, reported AP.Edgar remained active as a party statesman and adviser, though he grew uneasy with the Republican Party’s shift to the right.He was among high-profile Republicans who did not support Donald Trump’s presidency, joining a campaign supporting Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential bid called “Republicans for Harris.”In 1997, Edgar surprised many by announcing he would not seek a third term, despite his popularity. Republicans tried to draft him for other offices, including the US senate and another gubernatorial bid, but he declined.After leaving office, Edgar continued teaching and served as president emeritus of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, among other roles.Illinois governer JB Pritzker announced that state flags would fly at half-staff in Edgar’s honor.“Now more than ever, we should channel that spirit and resolve to live as Governor Edgar did: with honesty, integrity, and an enduring respect for all,” Pritzker said, as quoted by AP. “He will live on in the incalculable number of lives he touched and in the stronger institutions he helped build.”Edgar’s relatives said details on funeral plans would be announced in the coming days.","Jim Edgar, a two-term Republican governor of Illinois, died Sunday at the age of 79.

Unseen Video Of Charlie Kirk's Killing; How ‘Assassin’ Tyler Went From ‘Diehard Trump’ To ‘Hater’





Two men were arrested Friday after an incendiary device was discovered under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City, Utah.The bomb, which “had been lit but failed to function as designed,” did not go off, according to court records cited by CBS affiliate KUTV.Police and fire department bomb squads responded when the suspicious device was found near an occupied building. The FBI later identified two suspects and executed a search warrant at a home in the Magna neighborhood, west of downtown.During the search, neighboring homes were evacuated. Investigators recovered explosives, “explosive-related components,” firearms, illegal narcotics and other paraphernalia. Court records also noted the discovery of at least two hoax weapons of mass destruction.A 58-year-old man and a 31-year-old man were taken into custody and could face charges tied to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, ABC affiliate KTVX reported Sunday, as quoted by AP.Authorities have not released information on a possible motive, and the relationship between the suspects is not yet known.The incident comes as Salt Lake City drew national media attention following last week’s assassination of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.","Two men were arrested Friday after an incendiary device was discovered under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City, Utah.

'We welcome them': Trump calls on foreign firms to invest in US; urges bringing expert workers to train Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-welcome-them-trump-calls-on-foreign-firms-to-invest-in-us-urges-bringing-expert-workers-to-train-americans/articleshow/123887491.cms,"US President Donald Trump





President Donald Trump on Sunday urged foreign companies to expand investment in the United States and bring in expert personnel to train American workers in advanced manufacturing.In a post on Truth Social, Trump stressed the need for the country to relearn skills in industries such as semiconductors, shipbuilding, and high-tech machinery by learning directly from foreign firms making large-scale investments.""When Foreign Companies who are building extremely complex products, machines, and various other 'things,' come into the United States with massive Investments, I want them to bring their people of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back into their land,"" Trump said.He argued that such knowledge transfer is critical to restoring American industrial strength and ensuring lasting benefits from foreign investment. ""If we didn't do this, all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place -- Chips, Semiconductors, Computers, Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to be great at it, but not anymore,"" he added.""We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!"" said Trump.Trump's post comes a week after he warned foreign countries investing in America to abide by immigration laws after around 475 illegal workers were arrested after federal immigration authorities raided the Hyundai plant in Georgia. Many of the detained workers were South Korean citizens.Earlier this month, Trump said companies are increasingly choosing to build in the US to avoid tariffs and benefit from protective policies.""Thousands of companies are coming into the US... Traditionally, car companies... They are coming from China, Mexico, Canada... They want to build here because, number one, they like to be here, and number two, the tariffs are protecting them. And number three, they want to avoid paying tariffs. When you build their cars here, you don't have any tariffs,"" he stated at a White House press conference.","US President Donald Trump urged foreign companies to expand investment in the United States.
