Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad

New Delhi: Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced “Operation Herof 2.0”, a large-scale military offensive characterised by synchronised attacks at dawn. While BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12. The local administration claimed to have neutralised 58 BLA fighters.“Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out attacks at 12 locations across Balochistan. During the clashes with the terrorists, 12 personnel of the security forces and the police were martyred,” the Pak media reported, quoting the administration and adding that the attacks were foiled due to “timely and effective action”. In a post on X, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed that Pak security forces had killed 70 rebels at various locations across the province during the past two days.Spanning around 12 districts and especially targeting the provincial capital, Quetta, this offensive marks a significant escalation in regional conflict and is being regarded as the most extensive assault since 2024.The attacks involved use of suicide bombers and a significant number of women rebels at Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat and Pasni where bank, govt offices and Frontier ops HQ were targeted.The attacks coincided with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) top functionary Hafiz Hamdullah’s declaring that armed groups, not the state, now controlled Balochistan.BLA’s Hakkal media also released a new video footage showing commander Bashir Zeb leading armed separatist units on motorcycles.In a statement, BLA claimed to have brought under its control several areas of Quetta, besides Noshki jail and Pasni coast guard camp, police stations and the military intelligence office. BLA’s Majeed Brigade and Fateh Squad (or Fidayeen soldiers) participated in the operation.“The Baloch nation will defeat the enemy in every city, every street and every neighbourhood,” Jeeyand Baloch, spokesperson for BLA, said. Op Herof-I was conducted in Aug 2024 and saw at least 126 Pakistani soldiers being killed and scores injured.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced ‘Operation Herof 2.0’ BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12.

To be or not to be: Ajit Pawar’s death pushes Sharad Pawar into a Hamlet dilemma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-be-or-not-to-be-ajit-pawars-death-pushes-sharad-pawar-into-a-hamlets-dilemma/articleshow/127824799.cms,"Ajit Pawar Dead In Baramati Plane Crash During Emergency Landing, Maharashtra In Political Shock

Why is Sharad Pawar in a dilemma?

Sunetra in BJP’s trap?

Sharad Pawar’s political successor

Will the NCP’s numbers remain the same?

Claims and counterclaims

NEW DELHI: In Shakespeare’s classic Hamlet, the protagonist is torn by a dilemma over avenging his father’s death by killing his uncle Claudius. A similar Hamletian dilemma appears to have gripped Sharad Pawar over the merger of the two factions of the NCP after his nephew Ajit Pawar ’s death in a plane crash.While talking to reporters on Saturday, the veteran Maharashtra leader said that talks over the merger of both NCP factions were in the final stages. He claimed that even the merger date had been fixed -- February 12.“Now we feel his wish should be fulfilled. Ajit Pawar, Shashikant Shinde and Jayant Patil had initiated talks about the merger of the two factions. Even the merger date had been fixed -- it was scheduled for the 12th (February). Unfortunately, Ajit left us before that,” Sharad Pawar said.However, in a contrasting statement, Sharad Pawar also said that it is now uncertain whether both factions will go ahead with the merger.After Sunetra Pawar took oath as deputy chief minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, it became clear that the NCP - with 41 MLAs - will stay in the Mahayuti government.The decision appeared more evident after Sunetra replied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message on X, thanking him for his “trust”.Now, it is for Sharad Pawar to decide whether he will compromise for the merger and agree to enter into an alliance with the BJP or not. However, Sharad Pawar has on numerous occasions said that he would not align with the BJP under any circumstances.Meanwhile, many in the Pawar family are also upset over Sunetra’s decision to take oath as deputy CM just three days after her husband’s death.“When one of them called up, a member of Sunetra Pawar’s family said that she and one of her sons had already left for Mumbai to attend the oath-taking ceremony,” a close associate of the Pawar family told TOI.The sources added, “The deputy chief minister’s post is not a constitutional one and therefore, there was no need to arrange the oath-taking function on the fourth day after Ajit Pawar’s passing. Had the NCP shown the courtesy of waiting for the 12th or 13th day of mourning before making their political move, the other group would not have felt slighted.”The Pawar family now feels that by accepting the proposal without consulting them, Sunetra has walked into a BJP trap, they added.Due to health concerns, Sharad Pawar has taken a step back from active politics. He was even absent from campaigning during the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In his absence, his daughter and NCP(SP) working president Supriya Sule has been calling the shots. She is also being projected as Sharad Pawar’s political heir. Now, amid merger talks, speculation is rife over who will take over as the leader of a united NCP — Supriya Sule or someone from Ajit Pawar’s faction.After the split in 2023, several leaders such as Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare rose to prominence in the Ajit Pawar faction. If the merger takes place, the Pawar family could once again gain control over the party, pushing these leaders to the margins.If a merger does take place, there is a possibility that several MLAs from both factions may jump ship due to ideological differences, bringing down the NCP’s strength in the Maharashtra Assembly.According to political analysts, if a united NCP decides to join the opposition, several party MLAs could oppose the move and switch to the Shiv Sena or the BJP.Similarly, if the party decides to stay in alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, those aligned with Sharad Pawar’s group in the opposition may resist compromising on Phule–Ambedkar–Shahu ideology.Meanwhile, leaders from both factions have made claims and counterclaims citing the late NCP chief over the possibility of a merger. While NCP leaders said that coming together for the local body polls was a one-time arrangement, several NCP(SP) leaders claimed that merger talks were in the final stages.Senior NCP(SP) leader Jayant Patil on Saturday said that late NCP chief Ajit Pawar was eager to reunite with his uncle Sharad Pawar and had held several meetings to facilitate the merger.“He visited my house on multiple occasions and held talks over dinner. He said he wanted to reunite with his uncle by getting over the past. On January 16, we decided to contest the upcoming Zilla Parishad elections together, and the announcement of the formal merger was to be made on February 12,” Patil said.This came after Ajit Pawar met his uncle Sharad Pawar on January 17 and reportedly held discussions over the merger.However, NCP Maharashtra state president Sunil Tatkare refuted any discussion on the merger, claiming that the January 17 meeting was related to local body elections and an agriculture-related event.This followed both factions contesting the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together.However, the united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in both civic bodies. In the 165-member Pune Municipal Corporation, the NCP won 27 seats and NCP(SP) three seats, against the BJP’s tally of 119. In the 102-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, Ajit Pawar’s party won 37 seats while Sharad Pawar’s faction drew a blank, as the BJP secured 84 seats.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his advanced age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance. The Election Commission later recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol.",Sharad Pawar says talks over merger of NCP factions are in the final stages. But he says it is now uncertain whether both factions will go ahead with the merger. Many in the Pawar family are also upset over Sunetra Pawar’s decision to take oath as deputy CM just three days after her husband's death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824811,imgsize-480056,width-400,resizemode-4/sharad-pawar.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools. The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan.

PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the citizens of Goa want an ""honest and people-centric politics"" in the state, and added that his party will work towards fulfilling their hopes and aspirations.Kejriwal on Saturday held a meeting with the party's local unit to discuss ways to strengthen the party base in the coastal state.The former Delhi chief minister arrived in Goa on Friday on his three-day-long visit.In a post on X handle, Kejriwal wrote, ""Had a lunch meeting today with the Aam Aadmi Party Goa State Committee and held detailed discussions on strengthening the organisation in the state."" ""The people of Goa want an honest alternative and people centric politics. Together with the people, we will work to fulfil Goa's hopes and aspirations,"" he added.During the meeting, Kejriwal listened to suggestions from party leaders, who raised concern over large-scale land conversions, destruction of khazan lands and damage to lakes and rivers.These leaders alleged that unchecked development supported by the ruling BJP was harming Goa's ecology and affecting local livelihoods.Addressing the gathering along with AAP state unit chief Valmiki Naik and Goa in-charge Atishi, Kejriwal urged party functionaries to build a strong grassroots network that genuinely represents the people.""Our strength has always been our connection with people. Strengthen the organisation at the grassroots and become the voice of Goa. Listen to people's problems, help them raise issues, and ensure those issues are taken to their logical conclusion. Helping people and getting their work done is the real purpose of politics,"" Kejriwal said.Naik said Goa was facing ""unprecedented assault"" on its land, khazans, rivers and lakes, and asserted AAP's responsibility was to stand with the people and raise these issues fearlessly.""We should further strengthen our organisation and ensure we help people protect their land and fight for their rights,"" he said.Atishi said AAP's politics was rooted in service, honesty and accountability, and stressed local leaders must engage more deeply with communities to understand and resolve their concerns.In the 40-member Goa assembly, the AAP currently has two MLAs.Earlier this month, the AAP faced a major setback after a group of senior leaders, including its ex-state unit president Amit Palekar, acting chief Shrikrishna Parab and three other office-bearers, resigned from the primary membership of the party.Palekar was removed from the post of Goa AAP president late last month after the party faced humiliating defeat in the ZP (district councils) polls, winning just one of the 42 seats it contested in the December 20 elections.","Kejriwal on Saturday held a meeting with the party's local unit to discuss ways to strengthen the party base in the coastal state.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday mounted a sharp offensive against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee , alleging that her government has failed to protect women, people and land in the state, while allowing corruption and infiltration to flourish for electoral gains.Addressing a BJP Karyakarta Sammelan in North 24 Parganas’ Barrackpore, Shah said the slogan of “Maa, Maati, Manush”, under which Banerjee came to power, had “lost all meaning”, reported ANI.“In the state of Mamata Didi’s government, which came to power with the slogan ‘Maa, Mati, Manush’, today all three — Maa, Mati and Manush — are unsafe. Maa is insecure; there is no solid guarantee for women’s safety. Manush is troubled by Mamata’s syndicate, and Mati has been swallowed by infiltrators,” Shah said.The Home Minister accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government of providing shelter to infiltrators and deliberately weakening border security to protect its vote bank. Formation of a BJP government in West Bengal was crucial not just for the state but for national security, he said, as per PTI.“The way infiltration is taking place in West Bengal, it has become a security issue for the entire country. Even after court orders, the TMC government is not giving land to the BSF for border fencing because infiltrators are its vote bank,” Shah alleged.He further claimed that illegal migrants were being sent across the country using fake documents, with the state administration and police turning a blind eye.Referring to the recent deadly fire at a momo factory warehouse in Kolkata’s Anandpur area, Shah alleged that the incident was “not an accident but the result of corruption” under the Mamata Banerjee government.“I want to begin by paying tribute to all the workers who lost their lives in the fire at the momo factory in the Anandpur warehouse. This fire was not an accident. The fire at the Anandpur warehouse was a result of the corruption of the Mamata Banerjee government,” he said.Earlier this week, a massive fire at the factory left several people dead and many unaccounted for. According to police, 21 samples have been sent for profiling, 27 people have been reported missing and three arrests have been made, with investigations continuing.Questioning the state administration, Shah asked why the factory owners had not yet been arrested. “Has the administration completely ceased to exist in Bengal?” he said, suggesting that their alleged proximity to the ruling party was shielding them.Shah also accused the TMC government of intimidating the Matua and Namashudra communities, urging them not to be afraid.“I have come to know that Mamata Banerjee is intimidating the Matua community and the Namashudra community in West Bengal. There is no need to be afraid. Mamata ji cannot touch your vote,” he said, according to ANI.On the issue of corruption, the home minister threw a direct challenge to the chief minister, asking her to deny tickets to leaders facing graft allegations in the upcoming Assembly elections.“Today, I challenge Mamata ji. If you have the courage and if you truly oppose corruption, then prove it by not giving tickets to these people. You will not be able to do it,” Shah said, alleging that corruption had been “institutionalised” in the state.Shah also attacked the TMC over its opposition to a discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament, accusing the party of appeasement politics. On the 150th anniversary of the national song, he said Mamata Banerjee was not opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but Bengal’s identity and India’s pride.“By opposing Vande Mataram, Mamata Banerjee is not opposing Narendra Modi, but she is opposing the identity of Bengal and the pride of India,” he said, appealing to voters to “uproot” the TMC and establish a “government of patriots”.Drawing a parallel with the Ramayana, Shah predicted a decisive BJP victory. “When Lord Shri Ram built the Ram Setu, even Ravana thought he was invincible. Mamata ji, this time watch out. BJP’s vote share is going to be more than 50%, and our government will be formed with a massive majority,” he said.Shah is on a two-day visit to West Bengal as the BJP intensifies preparations for the Assembly elections due in a few months. He arrived in Kolkata on Friday night and addressed the workers’ meeting at Barrackpore on Saturday before flying to Bagdogra to attend an organisational meeting with party leaders from north Bengal.This is his second visit to the state within a month, underscoring the BJP’s focus on West Bengal as it seeks to dislodge the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government in the upcoming polls.","Union home minister Amit Shah mounts a sharp offensive against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

Final ops on to target ‘Big 4’ as Naxal-free deadline nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-ops-on-to-target-big-4-as-naxal-free-deadline-nears/articleshow/127811988.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the March 31, 2026 deadline for making the country ""Naxal-free"" approaches, the security forces are in the final leg of intelligence-based operations to get the remaining 'Big Four' of the apex CPI(Maoist) leadership -- three politburo-cum-central committee members and one central committee member -- and an estimated ""300-350 regular, uniformed cadres of concern"" still out there in the jungles.""Time is running out for these leaders, and full-time cadres spread across Chhattisgarh (around 200-250) and totalling no more than 10-20 each in Telangana, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. They must choose between eschewing the path of violence and being confronted by the security forces in their hideouts across the Indravati national park area, small pockets of Jharkhand, and the inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana,” Bastar range Inspector General P Sundarraj told TOI.There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active. Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji is the de facto No. 1, though not formally anointed as the CPI(Maoist) general secretary. Former general secretary Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathy is in his late seventies and supposedly ailing. Misir Besra, who is heading the CPI(Maoist) Eastern Regional Bureau since his predecessor Prashant Bose's arrest in 2021 and is the only non-Telugu face in PB, is currently operating in the Saranda forests of Jharkhand, where his aide and CC member Patiram Manjhi @ Anal Da was killed only a few days ago.The forces are already on Besra's trail. Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram, who is in charge of Maoist operations in Odisha, is not known to have been involved in any active operations for quite some time.Though some state police have a 5th CC member — Asim Mondal — in their ‘active’ list, opinion is divided on whether he indeed is part of the CC.Devji, though currently No. 1 in CP( Moist), is debilitated by the series of killings and surrenders by his PB/CC colleagues, senior commanders and armed cadres in the past year or so. ""There have been multiple public appeals for surrender, including at the political level, but Devji may prefer to go down fighting, holding on to Maoist ideology,"" said a senior officer.As a senior MHA functionary had told TOI earlier, the “end” of Left-wing extremism may not mean there will be no incidents of Maoist violence. “But such incidents will be isolated and dealt with at the police station level. CPI(Maoist) will no longer have an organised, cadre-based strength operating across states,” said the officer.Between January 1, 2025, and January 22, 2026, a dozen central committee members, including general secretary and politburo member Basavaraju, were neutralised by the counter-Naxal forces, and five opted for surrender. There are still two senior commanders -- Pappa Rao and Prabhakar, both members of the Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC) — on the loose. They are said to be active in the inter-state border of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, covering Kanker, Gadchiroli and south of Indravati.The flood of Maoist surrenders last year, including by PB and CC member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu; CC members Chandranna and Sujata in Telangana; and Ramder and Rupesh in Chhattisgarh, along with the huge dent in Naxal arsenal with the recovery of 698 weapons and 915 IEDs in Chhattisgarh alone over the past year, have left the Maoists a depleted army on ventilator support.","There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active.

Ryan Wedding and the people accused of helping his global drug network

Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder, stood in a federal courtroom in California on Monday, facing serious charges that shocked the sports world. Wedding, now 44, is accused of running a massive drug network and ordering multiple murders, according to US authorities. Wedding was arrested last week in Mexico City and flown to Southern California, nearly a year after the FBI placed him on its Most Wanted Fugitives list. He pleaded not guilty to two federal indictments during his first court appearance. His lawyer, Anthony Colombo, strongly denied reports that Wedding turned himself in.“He was arrested,” Colombo told reporters. “He did not surrender.”FBI Director Kash Patel described Wedding as a major threat. “He is a modern-day El Chapo,” Patel said Friday. “He is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice.” Federal prosecutors claim Ryan Wedding led a billion-dollar drug operation uncovered during a joint investigation called Operation Giant Slalom. Law enforcement agencies from North and South America worked together on the case, according to the US Department of Justice.Wedding’s criminal history goes back years. In 2008, he was arrested for trying to buy cocaine from a US federal agent.He was convicted in 2009 and released from prison in 2011. Authorities say his alleged criminal empire grew rapidly after his release. Prosecutors also accuse Wedding of ordering murders to protect his operation. Among the victims were Canadian couple Jagtar Sidhu and Harbhajan Sidhu, who were killed in front of their daughter, Jaspreet Kaur, who suffered life-changing injuries. Authorities still think it was a case of mistaken identity.Federal officials say Ryan Wedding did not work alone. Several people linked to him are now under investigation, arrested, or facing extradition. Wedding’s wife, Miryam Andrea Castillo Moreno, has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department over alleged money laundering. She has not been arrested, and her current location is unknown, according to Treasury and FBI officials. Castillo Moreno is originally from Nuevo Leon, Mexico, based on the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list.His alleged girlfriend, Daniela Alejandra Acuna Macias, has also been sanctioned and banned from entering the United States. The Treasury Department said she received large sums of money from Wedding and helped gather information on his rivals.Authorities say Acuna was introduced to Wedding by Carmen Yelinet Valoyes Florez, a Colombian national accused of running a high-end escort service in Mexico City. Valoyes was arrested in November as part of Operation Giant Slalom, according to federal records.Another key figure is Deepak Balwant Paradkar, a Canadian criminal lawyer accused of advising Wedding to kill an FBI witness. “If you kill this witness, the case would be dismissed,” Paradkar allegedly told Wedding, according to Bill Essayli, first assistant US attorney for the Central District of California. Paradkar denies the claims and is fighting extradition.Andrew Clark, known as “El Dictador,” is also accused of working closely with Wedding. US prosecutors say Clark helped order murders in Canada and lived in Mexico under cartel protection. All accused individuals have not entered final pleas and remain innocent under the law, according to court records and the US Department of Justice.","Ryan Wedding is accused of running a massive drug network and ordering multiple murders.

Epstein files: US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick planned visit to Jeffrey’s private island,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-us-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-planned-visit-to-jeffreys-private-island/articleshow/127812327.cms,"US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick

DOJ Releases Millions Of Epstein Files As Emails Make Bombshell Claims About Bill Gates | WATCH





US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who once said that he avoided being in one room with Jeffrey Epstein , had planned a trip to his private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.The planned visit in 2012 came years after Lutnick had said he severed ties with Epstein.In December 2012, the records show, Lutnick sent an email to Epstein saying that he had a group of people including his wife and children and another family who were visiting the Caribbean. He asked where Epstein was located and whether they could visit for a meal, New York Times reported.Epstein replied through an assistant to give more information about the location of Little St. James, his private island off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. They eventually settled on plans for a lunch gathering.Prominent people who were close to Epstein have been scrutinised in recent years for their visits to Little St. James, but Lutnick’s planned visit had not been previously disclosed. Reached by phone on Friday, Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said. He then hung up.The documents suggest the visit did occur. The gathering was set for Dec. 23, 2012. A day later, an assistant to Epstein forwarded Lutnick a message from Epstein: “Nice seeing you,” it said.In a podcast interview last year, Lutnick claimed that around 2005, he and his wife had been so revolted by Epstein that they decided not to associate with him again.Lutnick said in the interview that Epstein invited them to tour his Upper East Side mansion, next door to Lutnick’s own home. When they noticed a massage table in the middle of a room, Lutnick recalled, Epstein explained that he received “the right kind of massage” every day. Lutnick said that he and his wife quickly left and decided to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.”“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy,” Lutnick said in the interview with Pod Force One. “If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”Before they connected in December 2012, an assistant to Epstein had reached out to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together,” the assistant wrote the month before.Lutnick planned the Caribbean excursion along with his wife, Allison. She explained in an email that they would be arriving on a 188-foot yacht called “Excellence.”The documents show that Lutnick and Epstein’s lives continued to overlap in more recent years. In 2017, Epstein contributed to a charity dinner honouring Lutnick. In 2018, they exchanged emails that appear to discuss them joining forces to battle construction plans by The Frick Collection, a museum across the street from both of their homes.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick had planned a trip to Jeffrey Epstein's private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" that left two people dead at the hands of federal immigration agents, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" and believes America must live up to its highest ideals. In an internal memo sent Tuesday, as obtained by Bloomberg, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.The memo comes as Cook faces mounting criticism for his proximity to the Trump administration. On Saturday, just hours after ICE agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti—an intensive care nurse at the US Department of Veterans Affairs—Cook was spotted at a VIP screening of the ""Melania"" documentary at the White House.""This is a time for de-escalation,"" Cook wrote in Tuesday's message to staff. ""I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from.""Cook said he had a ""good conversation"" with Trump where he shared these views, though he didn't specify the president's response or any commitments made. ""I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all,"" he added.The Apple chief has maintained close ties with the Trump administration since the president's re-election, becoming a regular fixture at White House events and policy briefings. Trump has frequently praised Cook in public speeches.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint for immigration enforcement tensions. Pretti's killing on Saturday followed another fatal ICE shooting on January 7, when agents killed 37-year-old poet Renée Good in the same city. Cook acknowledged the emotional toll on his workforce, praising their empathy as ""one of Apple's greatest strengths.""","Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" In an internal memo sent Tuesday, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.

LUCKNOW: Director General of Prisons suspended another deputy jailer in connection with the escape of two high-risk inmates from Ayodhya District Jail, taking the total number of officials suspended in the case to twelve, including the jail superintendent. Departmental proceedings have also been ordered against the officer.The incident took place on the night of January 28, when two inmates managed to flee after breaking through the wall of their barrack. The escapees were identified as Golu Agrahari alias Suraj, a resident of Musafirkhana in Amethi district, and Sher Ali from Sultanpur. Both prisoners are involved in serious criminal cases, including murder, dacoity and rape.Based on the inquiry report submitted by DIG Prisons, Ayodhya Range, Shailendra Kumar Maitreya, disciplinary action had earlier been taken against Jail Superintendent Uday Pratap Mishra, Jailer Jitendra Kumar Yadav, Deputy Jailer Mayank Tripathi, Head Jail Warders Harihar Prasad and Tripurari Mishra, and jail warders Suresh Kumar Dubey, Jaiprakash Yadav, Sunil Kumar, Ramesh Sahani, Ravi Yadav and Manoj.On Friday, another Deputy Jailer, Raju alias Rajdeep, was suspended after the investigation revealed serious lapses in duty.DIG Shailendra Kumar stated that inmates are normally sent to barracks only after thorough evening checks. However, the probe found that the escaped prisoners had carried tools inside the barrack, which they used to remove bricks from the wall and flee, indicating that mandatory frisking was not conducted. The responsibility for checking lay with the suspended deputy jailer.Director General of Prisons PC Meena said that further negligence had come to light during the investigation, necessitating additional suspensions.He added that a detailed probe is continuing and strict action will be taken against all officials found responsible.","The incident took place on the night of January 28, when two inmates managed to flee after breaking through the wall of their barrack.

US government enters partial shutdown after Congress fails to pass 2026 budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-enters-partial-shutdown-after-congress-fails-to-pass-2026-budget/articleshow/127814414.cms,"Schumer DARES Trump On ICE After Rare Deal Stripping DHS Funding To Halt Shutdown: ‘No Vote Unless…’

The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight. The shutdown was triggered by Democratic opposition to federal immigration agents killing two protesters in Minneapolis, which halted talks about Department of Homeland Security funding. However, the disruption is expected to be brief as the House plans to approve a Senate-backed deal early next week.The Senate also passed a funding package Friday that covers many federal agencies through September. It also includes a temporary two-week extension for DHS operations while lawmakers work out immigration enforcement details. However, about 75% of federal operations are impacted by the shutdown, affecting various sectors like education, health, housing, and defense.Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin criticised the administration's priorities, saying, ""Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis."" He added, ""This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.""Federal departments started implementing shutdown procedures overnight.If the shutdown continues beyond a few days, many federal workers could face unpaid leave or work without pay until funding resumes. However, both Republican and Democratic leaders believe the disruption will be short-lived once the House approves the Senate's package.President Trump has endorsed the Senate's agreement and is pushing for quick House action. He aims to avoid a lengthy shutdown like the record-breaking hit last fall that disrupted federal services for over a month. The House, currently out of session until Monday, is expected to vote on the package when they return.While federal agencies began shutdown preparations, the impact on government services, contractors, and federal workers should be minimal if the House passes the funding package as anticipated early next week. This would restore funding within days, limiting the shutdown's practical effects.","The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight.

KDMC mayor race ends as Shiv Sena and BJP file joint nomination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/kdmc-mayor-race-ends-as-shiv-sena-and-bjp-file-joint-nomination/articleshow/127813544.cms,"



KALYAN: Putting an end to days of political speculation and uncertainty, Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have jointly filed nominations for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor elections of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC). Along with Shiv Sena and the BJP, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)—which had earlier extended its support to Shiv Sena in KDMC—has also emerged as a partner in power with the ruling Mahayuti, indicating a broader political consensus in the civic body.The two Shiv Sena and BJP had contested the KDMC elections together, and their joint move has now brought clarity to the corporation’s top leadership.For the post of Mayor, Shiv Sena has nominated Advocate Harshali Chaudhari, while the BJP has fielded senior corporator Rahul Damle for the post of Deputy Mayor. Friday was the last day for filing nominations, and notably, only one nomination was submitted for each post. This has made the election outcome virtually certain, with the election process scheduled during the special general body meeting on February 3 expected to be a mere formality.Earlier, political circles were rife with speculation after five corporators from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) extended support to Shiv Sena, and four corporators from Shiv Sena (UBT) were reportedly untraceable but said to be in contact with Shiv Sena leaders.These developments had sparked discussions over whether Shiv Sena's Kalyan Local MP Shrikant Shinde who played important role into getting MNS and four UBT corporators support was attempting to sideline its alliance partner, the BJP, in the mayoral race.However, the joint nomination by Shiv Sena and the BJP has effectively put all such speculation to rest. Shiv Sena’s Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde, along with local BJP leaders, was present during the filing of nomination forms on Friday.Speaking on the occasion, MP Shrikant Shinde said that welfare schemes launched by the government, especially those aimed at empowering women such as the Ladli Behna initiatives, had received overwhelming public support. As a mark of respect for this support, women candidates have been given leadership roles in KDMC, Thane, and Ulhasnagar. He expressed confidence that Advocate Harshali Chaudhari, as Mayor, along with Deputy Mayor Rahul Damle, would work together to accelerate the city’s development.Chaudhari, a lawyer by profession, is a second-term corporator from Shiv Sena and is known for her developmental work in her ward. Speaking to TOI, she expressed gratitude to the party for placing its trust in her as a woman candidate. She said that after assuming office, her priorities would include strengthening basic civic amenities, promoting women’s empowerment, completing ongoing Smart City projects, and expediting major infrastructure works such as the metro, flyovers, and other developmental initiatives to make Kalyan-Dombivli a truly smart city.Damle, who is senior corporator from BJP and earlier was once deputy Mayor, standing committee chairman and opposition leader in KDMC. He haa filed nomination for second time for deputy Mayor. Talking to TOI, he thanked the top leadership of both BJP and Shiv Sena for reposing their confidence in him. He said that due to the absence of municipal elections over the past five years, several development works had remained pending, and his focus would be on completing those projects and ensuring faster implementation of remaining development plans.","Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have jointly filed nominations for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor elections of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation.

GHAZIABAD: Two men were stabbed to death and another critically injured after a dispute over a delay in serving food at an eatery in Ghaziabad late Friday night. Police said four suspects have been detained for questioning.According to officials, two groups of customers, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, got into a heated argument over the delay, which soon escalated into a violent clash. During the altercation, members of both groups allegedly attacked each other with sharp-edged weapons.Locals alerted the police, who rushed to the spot and shifted the three injured youths to a nearby hospital.

"Noida techie death: What district admin told SIT; warnings, safety gaps, coordination issues highlighted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sought-trained-divers-noida-admin-tells-sit-probing-techie-death/articleshow/127809455.cms,"



NOIDA: The district administration has told the special investigation team (SIT) probing the drowning of software engineer Yuvraj Mehta earlier this month that it had already flagged the need for specialist divers and a faster emergency response, and issued multiple advisories to development authorities to prevent accidents in fog and around construction sites.In its submission to the SIT, the administration said though it wrote to key agencies with specific recommendations, it did not get proper responses, sources said. Mehta's death on Jan 16 put Noida's emergency response mechanism under scrutiny because it took agencies more than four and a half hours to reach him although he kept flashing his phone's torch at the responders, who either did not know how to swim or did not want to get into the water.His father also accused police and other agencies of delaying efforts to save Mehta. The road the software engineer took on his way back home has a sharp right-angle turn that became hazardous amid dense fog, more so in the absence of warning signs and lighting.In its account to SIT, the administration said it had moved months earlier to precisely plug such rescue gaps. In Oct last year, soon after Noida saw the Yamuna breach its banks, the administration said it wrote to police asking them to prepare a roster of trained divers within the force so they could be mobilised quickly for local rescue operations.""The administration does not have trained force personnel to be deputed for relief and rescue operations. However, as district disaster management authority is the central coordinating and planning agency for such measures, the district magistrate — who is the authority chairperson — wrote to the police commissioner last year to provide a list of trained divers from police and fire department. The idea was to initiate immediate relief and response operations,"" a senior official told TOI.The administration, sources said, also told the SIT it tried to strengthen the fire department's capacity after the floods last Sept. ""The fire department was equipped with additional response gear, including a boat, a motorised boat, life rings, life jackets and protective shoes, to improve rescue response,"" the official said.According to the submission, the district administration wrote to Noida Authority last Sept to provide land or housing so a team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) or National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) could be stationed in the city for immediate response.""The district administration can ask the state govt to provide a team of SDRF or NDRF for Noida only if we have space to accommodate them. So, we wrote to Noida Authority to provide land or housing. However, we received no response,"" the official said.The submission also listed a series of preventive directions issued in the months preceding Mehta's death. On Aug 22, 2025, during a district disaster management meeting, the district magistrate instructed all three development authorities — Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway — to ensure there was no waterlogging anywhere in the district. It also asked the authorities to inspect safety standards in high-rise societies and submit a report.On Dec 16, as part of a fog advisory, the administration asked agencies to fix potholes, identify sharp accident-prone turns and install signage, barriers, speed breakers and reflectors at such stretches. The directive also flagged risks around development work, where digging and road constructions were underway. The transport department was asked to run a campaign encouraging vehicle owners to use radium stickers to improve visibility.The official admitted the lack of inter-departmental coordination. ""There needs to be better coordination among departments in the district. There are several development authorities, a separate administration and a police commissionerate as well. Better coordination between these agencies is the need of the hour,"" he added.The official also agreed that the administration could only issue recommendations. ""Police and development authorities are independently functioning agencies. They do not come under the administration's purview. We can only issue letters, not implement recommendations,"" the official added.",Yuvraj Mehta's death on Jan 16 put Noida's emergency response mechanism under scrutiny. It took agencies more than four and a half hours to reach him. Administration said it had moved months earlier to plug such rescue gaps.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127813237,imgsize-809782,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/noida-techie-death.jpg"

In newly released documents of Epstein files, an email caught everyone's attention as it mentioned Microsoft founder Bill Gates , who got sexually transmitted disease from “Russian girls.”Screenshots of alleged 2013 self-emails attributed to Jeffrey Epstein claimed Bill Gates contracted a sexually transmitted disease from “Russian girls” and asked for antibiotics to secretly give to his then-wife, Melinda.The allegations were not verified and were heavily disputed by context and prior denials from Gates. None of the claims were substantiated.The claims appeared in what were described as screenshots of self-emails written by Epstein, among a new tranche of hundreds of thousands of documents released by the DOJ on Friday.According to the documents released Friday by the Department of Justice, Epstein wrote a lengthy message to himself on July 18, 2013, lashing out at Gates for ending their relationship and alleging efforts to cover up personal matters, the US Sun reported.In one passage, Epstein allegedly wrote: “TO add insult to the injury you them (sic) implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your *****.”Earlier in the same message, Epstein said he had been “dismayed beyond comprehension” by Gates’s decision to “disregard our friendship developed over the last six years.”In that email, Epstein allegedly wrote: “I have been caught up in a severe marital dispute between Melinda and Bill…”He continued: “In my role as his right hand man I have been asked and wrongly acquiesced into participating in things that have ranged from the morally inappropriate, to the ethically unsound and have been repeatedly asked to do thing (sic) that get near and potentially over the line into the illegal…”Gates previously said he regretted his association with Epstein, who died in a New York City jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, and long denied any wrongdoing.In the last released documents, multiple undated images showing Epstein and Gates together in various locations were present. In one photograph, Gates was seen smiling next to a woman whose face was redacted.Gates and Melinda were married from 1994 to 2021. Melinda said Gates’s affairs and his relationship with Epstein were factors in their divorce, without providing further detail. She reportedly hired divorce lawyers in 2019 after concerns over Gates’s alleged dealings with Epstein, according to The Wall Street Journal.Meanwhile, Bill Gates, through his philanthropic foundation, has issued a strongly worded denial calling the information ""absurd and completely false.""",Alleged 2013 self-emails attributed to Jeffrey Epstein claimed Bill Gates contracted a sexually transmitted disease from “Russian girls” The allegations were not verified and were heavily disputed by context and prior denials from Gates.

He, however, declined to reveal details about the ailment or treatment.Das became a topic of social media discussion on Wednesday when a photo of his red hair went viral on social media, drawing widespread criticism. Memes, jokes, and sarcastic posts flooded digital platforms, with many questioning whether such an appearance was befitting of a uniformed officer.The viral image had prompted senior police officers to intervene. Das was advised to apply black dye to his hair to avoid further criticism. Officials said they were initially unaware of his medical condition. “When we issued him a verbal warning and inquired as to why he changed his hair colour, he disclosed his medical issues,” a senior officer said.The officer further said that the police manual does not prescribe rules regarding hair colour or appearance. “Many officers flaunt long and big moustaches. It is about personal choice and is a subjective matter,” he added.","DSP Rashmi Ranjan Das became a topic of social media discussion on Wednesday when a photo of his red hair went viral on social media.

Iran ‘talking to us’: Trump



Tehran warns against attack







US President Donald Trump has warned Canada of a “very substantial” American response if it proceeds with a trade agreement with China, while at the same time signalling a softer stance towards Iran by saying Tehran was “talking to” Washington even as US military deployments in the region continued.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday (local time), Trump said the US would act decisively if Ottawa followed through on the deal it has negotiated with Beijing.“If they do a deal with China, yeah, we’ll do something very substantial,” Trump said. “We don’t want China to take over Canada. And if they make the deal that he’s looking to make, China will take over Canada,” according to Reuters.Trump last week had threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Canada if it went ahead with the proposed agreement with China.Responding to which Canadian PM Mark Carney said, Canada has “no intention” of going forward with a deal with China.Separately, Trump said Iran was negotiating with the United States, hinting at the possibility of a deal even as tensions remained high.“(Iran is) talking to us, and we’ll see if we can do something, otherwise we’ll see what happens… We have a big fleet heading out there,” Trump told Fox News, adding: “They are negotiating,” according to AFP.He said US allies in the region were not being briefed on possible military plans for security reasons.“Well, we can’t tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan – it could be worse, actually,” Trump said.Washington has deployed a naval strike group led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln off Iran’s shores, a move that has raised fears of a direct confrontation.Iran, meanwhile, has issued warnings against any military action. Army chief Amir Hatami said Iranian forces were at “full defensive and military readiness” and warned that any attack would endanger regional security, according to state news agency IRNA.Iranian officials have also indicated openness to talks. Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, said “the formation of a structure for negotiations is progressing,” following talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said a broader conflict would harm both sides, adding that Iran had never sought war and did not believe it would serve the interests of Iran, the US or the region.Qatar has also stepped in diplomatically, with its prime minister holding talks in Tehran on Saturday to push for de-escalation, the Gulf state’s foreign ministry said.","US President Donald Trump warns Canada of a “very substantial” response if it proceeds with a trade agreement with China.

TOI correspondent from Washington

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





: In a move that underscores the MAGA v Moderate Republican politics in the US heartland, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program, targeting what his office described as fraudulent schemes that disadvantage U.S. workers.Paxton said his office issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the three North Texas companies requiring them to turn over records related to their operations, employees, and visa sponsorship practices. The businesses, which are purportedly run by Indians according to local media reports, are suspected of creating “sham companies” and maintaining “ghost offices” in order to improperly obtain H-1B visas for foreign workers.According to the attorney general’s office, some entities allegedly used misleading websites advertising products or services that do not exist, with the sole purpose of justifying visa sponsorships. “Any criminal who attempts to scam the H-1B visa program and use ‘ghost offices’ or other fraudulent ploys should be prepared to face the full force of the law,” Paxton said in a statement, arguing that such abuse “strips jobs and opportunities away from Texans.” His office also launched a public tip portal to solicit information on potential violations.As of this week, no charges have been filed, and the companies under investigation – which Paxton did not name – have not publicly responded. Local reports named two of the companies: Qubitz Tech Systems LLC, which reportedly has 13 approved H-1B visa employees; and 3BEES Technologies, with 27 H-1B visas approved between 2022 and 2025.Industry insiders say Paxton and the MAGA media are mischaracterizing a standard business model in the IT consulting world, where a ""bodyshop"" often has a small administrative footprint (sometimes a home office) because its workers are physically located at the offices of major clients (like banks or telecom giants). Several Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have large operations in Texas, employing thousands of workers, including native-born Americans.But Paxton’s investigation seeks to prove some of the smaller, so-called ""body shops"" are not legitimate consulting firms but ""sham"" operations that exist to charge fees for visa sponsorship and offer “bench” services to clients while collecting part of the workers’ wages.The H-1B program allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, and medicine. While widely used by major employers, the program has long drawn criticism from labor advocates and immigration skeptics who argue it can be exploited to undercut domestic wages or replace US workers. Texas ranks second only to California in the number of H-1B approvals, heightening the local political and economic stakes.Paxton’s move follows an executive directive issued by Governor Greg Abbott one day earlier, ordering state agencies and public higher education institutions to freeze new H-1B visa petitions until May 31, 2027. Affected agencies must report details on current visa holders to the Texas Workforce Commission by March 27, including job roles, countries of origin, visa expiration dates, and efforts to recruit Texans first.The state actions mirror heightened federal scrutiny of the program. In September 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Labor launched coordinated fraud investigations, including the Labor Department’s “Project Firewall,” aimed at ensuring employers prioritize American workers and comply with wage and recruitment rules.While framed as an enforcement effort, Paxton’s investigation also unfolds against the backdrop of his Senate campaign. Paxton is challenging John Cornyn, a four-term senator and former GOP whip, in the March 3, 2026, Republican primary. Paxton has cast himself as a hardline conservative aligned with “America First” priorities, repeatedly criticizing Cornyn as too moderate on issues such as US aid to Ukraine and immigration.Recent polling shows Paxton and Cornyn effectively tied, and with a third candidate, Congressman Wesley Hunt also in the field, there is the possibility of a May runoff if no candidate gets 50 per cent vote. President Trump is yet to weigh in on the race.Taken together, the investigation and the Senate race underscore a broader struggle within the Texas Republican Party between MAGA-aligned insurgents and more traditional conservatives. The outcome could shape not only the party’s direction on immigration policy, but also Texas’s influence in national debates over labor, work visas, enforcement, and economic growth.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program. Paxton said his office issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the three North Texas companies.

The Reddit post of the man claiming that it freaked him out to find out that USCIS officials are still keeping an eye on him has spread alarm at a time when the US has tightened its overall vetting processes and H-1B visa holders in India are facing stamping delays because of the newly introduced social media vetting.The North Carolina Redditor claimed his LinkedIn profile was first viewed by a case officer and then by lawyers. The man said he came to the US in 2015 on an F-1 student visa and then got into STEM OPT until he was picked up by the H-1B lottery in 2020.The man said he got married in 2021 to an Indian-origin citizen in the US and applied for a marriage-based Green Card in 2023. It was approved in January 2024 without any interview as it was a 10-year no-condition Green Card as his marriage was, by then, already over 2 years.The Redditor revealed that he has no criminal record but only a speeding ticket before his Green Card approval from 2023. He is still with his wife, he confirmed ruling out any possibility of a USCIS check in such cases if the marriage is over.Some social media users called it 'psychological warfare on immigrant communities', while many explained that it could have many other possible explanations like the Redditor having a very common name etc.Some analyzed that since the man is a Green Card holder and not yet a citizen, he is still on the radar of the immigration agencies.Green Card cases are on the radar of the administration as the authorities have frozen all Green Card applications from 75 countries, and are also reviewing Green Cards of people aapproved by the Biden administration from certain designated countries.","A Green Card holder from India took to Reddit, claiming that his LinkedIn profile was being checked by someone at USCIS even though his Green Card case was closed in 2024.

'Trump's Domestic Army On The Loose': Bernie Sanders Pushes To Shift ICE's $75 Bn To Medicaid





A federal judge on Saturday ordered the release of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, from a Texas detention centre by Tuesday, sharply criticising the Trump administration’s immigration policies. The ruling came after the pair were detained by immigration officers in Minnesota on January 20 and moved to a facility in Dilley, Texas.Images of Liam wearing a bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack surrounded by ICE officers drew national attention and outrage. US District Judge Fred Biery, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said the case reflected “the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children.”Neighbors and school officials claimed immigration officers used Liam to lure his mother to the door, though the Department of Homeland Security denied this. Arias entered the US illegally from Ecuador in December 2024, but his lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim.Biery referenced the Declaration of Independence and Bible verses in his ruling, including “Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me…’” and “Jesus wept.” He highlighted the trauma caused to children and families under the current enforcement approach.","5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father were detained by immigration officers in Minnesota on January 20.

Schumer DARES Trump On ICE After Rare Deal Stripping DHS Funding To Halt Shutdown: ‘No Vote Unless…’





US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he has instructed the Department of Homeland Security not to get involved in protests in Democratic-led cities unless local authorities request federal assistance or federal property is under threat.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said cities must protect their own state and local property. “Under no circumstances are we going to participate unless, and until, they ask us for help,” he wrote. He added that ICE and Border Patrol personnel would continue to guard federal buildings and would do so “very powerfully”.The statement came a day after thousands of people protested in Minneapolis and other US cities, calling for federal immigration agencies to leave Minnesota.The protests followed the fatal shootings of two US citizens and the deployment of around 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis area as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.Trump also said federal forces would not tolerate attacks on officers or government property. “We will not allow our courthouses, federal buildings, or anything else under our protection, to be damaged,” he wrote, warning of “equal, or more, consequence” for violence.",US President Donald Trump said he has instructed the Department of Homeland Security not to get involved in protests in Democratic-led cities.

She said there was evidence of a “profound and even heartbreaking” effect on communities, including claims of racial profiling and excessive force by federal agents.","US District Judge Katherine Menendez denied a request for a preliminary injunction filed by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and the mayors of Minneapolis and St Paul.

Who is Katherine Menendez?

ICE operations in Minnesota





A federal judge on Saturday rejected an attempt by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to block a major surge of federal immigration enforcement under President Trump, ruling that the state is unlikely to succeed in its constitutional challenge.In a 30-page decision, US District Judge Katherine Menendez declined to issue an injunction that would have halted “Operation Metro Surge,” a large-scale deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel across Minnesota.“Plaintiffs ask the Court to extend existing precedent to a new context where its application is less direct,” Menendez wrote, referring to the state’s 10th Amendment claim.“None of the cases on which they rely have even come close.”Menendez acknowledged that the lawsuit raised serious concerns, at one point suggesting federal agents may have engaged in racial profiling or used excessive force, but said the legal standard for sweeping preliminary relief had not been met.She also ruled that stopping the operation would significantly harm the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts.“If that injunction went too far, then the one at issue here — halting the entire operation — certainly would,” she added, referencing a separate ICE-related case recently paused by an appeals court.Katherine Marie Menendez (born 1971) is a US district judge for the District of Minnesota, a position she has held since 2021 after being appointed by former President Joe Biden.Before joining the federal bench, Menendez spent much of her legal career as a public defender. She became an assistant federal defender in 1999 and served in the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the District of Minnesota until 2016, representing defendants in complex federal criminal cases.On January 26, 2026, Menendez heard oral arguments in Minnesota’s lawsuit against the federal government, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a case that has intensified scrutiny of ICE operations in the state.Minnesota has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown. First announced in December, “Operation Metro Surge” has brought nearly 3,000 ICE and CBP personnel into the state, particularly targeting Minneapolis and St. Paul.Public anger escalated after the January 24 killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, during a protest on Nicollet Avenue in south Minneapolis. Federal officials claimed Pretti posed a threat, but video footage shows he was not pointing a weapon and appeared to have been disarmed before being shot.Earlier this month, Renee Good, a mother of three, was also killed during a separate federal enforcement incident. The deaths have sparked nationwide protests and renewed scrutiny of ICE, which recorded 32 deaths in custody in 2025, its deadliest year in two decades.Despite Saturday’s ruling, Minnesota officials say the lawsuit will continue as the case moves forward.","US District Judge Katherine Menendez declined to issue an injunction that would have halted “Operation Metro Surge,’ a large-scale deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel across Minnesota.

Two Indian-origin men have been arrested in the United States on federal money laundering charges following an investigation into a large scam operation that targeted victims across several states, authorities said.Tejas Patel and Navya Bhatt are facing three counts of money laundering each, according to the Cleveland1. This comes after federal agents uncovered their alleged role in a series of scams that defrauded people of hundreds of thousands of dollars in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.According to investigators, the scams included PayPal fraud, fake Microsoft computer repair schemes and Bitcoin-related cons. Victims were instructed to make payments in unusual forms, including gold bars, cryptocurrency, and large amounts of cash.Court documents detail how one woman in Toledo was deceived into handing over more than $40,000 in cash after the suspects falsely claimed they were representatives of the Federal Trade Commission.Federal authorities said the money laundering operation was tied to a bigger network involved in moving and concealing funds obtained through fraud.The investigation was led by the FBI’s Cleveland Division Cyber Squad, which focuses on computer-related and financial crimes.According to a criminal complaint note, Bhatt is a student at the University of Toledo. Both men appeared in federal court on Friday, where they waived their preliminary hearings.Patel is scheduled to return to court on February 6 for a detention hearing. Bhatt is currently under an ICE detainer and has not yet been given another court date.Other suspects, who had already been arrested before the court received the affidavit, were also named in the complaint as being part of the scheme. Vedantkumar Patel and Visweswarayya Kunuku were said to have worked as couriers.","Tejas Patel and Navya Bhatt are facing three counts of money laundering each.
