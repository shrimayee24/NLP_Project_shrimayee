'Both had to do something in India': Congress leader claims CIA–Mossad behind 2014 rout; BJP hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/both-had-to-do-something-in-india-congress-leader-claims-ciamossad-behind-2014-rout-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/125628214.cms,"Here's what former Congress MP said



What BJP said



NEW DELHI: Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party engaged in war of words after the grand old party's former MP claimed meddling by US and Israel intelligence agencies in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. Kumar Ketkar blamed Mossad and CIA for the Congress party's loss.BJP MP Sambit Patra, in turn, quipped saying that the Congress lost because ""Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI"" carried forward its ""agenda in India"".The former Rajya Sabha MP noted that the party secured 145 Lok Sabha seats in 2004 and increased its tally to 206 in the 2009 general election. If that trajectory had continued, he argued, the Congress might have reached around 250 seats and easily held on to power. Instead, the party’s seat count plunged to 44 in 2014, he observed.""There were organisations that acted in a way that 'till the time we do not bring down the Congress from 206, we would not be able to play games here (in India),"" he said.""One of the organisations was the CIA and another was the Mossad of Israel. Both had decided that they had to do something in India. If a stable Congress government or a Congress-led alliance government came back to power again, they would not have been able to interfere in India and implement their policies,"" he added.""The Mossad prepared detailed data on states and constituencies. The CIA and the Mossad have detailed data on states and constituencies,"" the former journalist said.The BJP countered Congress leader Ketkar’s allegation, insisting that its victories come from the support of ""the people, not foreign intelligence agencies"".""Neither the CIA nor the Mossad makes the BJP win. It is the people who make the BJP win. Those who get gas cylinders and housing, as well as the poor, farmers, women and youth, make the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win,"" he said.""If you will work on the ISI’s blueprint, seek to reconstruct the Babri mosque, oppose Ram temple… If the Congress follows the ISI agenda, how will it progress?"" the BJP leader told reporters at the party headquarters,"" he added.","Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party engaged in war of words after the grand old party's former MP claimed meddling by US and Israel intelligence agencies.

'Animal Will Pay': Trump Erupts After 2 National Guardsmen Shot Near White House; DC In Lockdown

Two National Guard members shot near White House





Authorities have identified the suspect in the Washington DC shooting that critically injured two National Guard members near the White House.Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the accused is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021. Officials are still verifying all his details, and the motive remains unclear.Images shared online appeared to show the suspect being taken away in handcuffs after being shot and placed on a stretcher.“This is the man who opened fire on the National Guard just one day before Thanksgiving. He was taken away in handcuffs after being shot, stripped, and loaded onto a stretcher before being placed in an ambulance,"" an X user wrote, sharing the picture.The shooting happened on Wednesday afternoon when National Guard members were on “high-visibility patrols” near 17th Street and I Street NW.Police said the gunman came around a corner, raised a handgun, and fired directly at the two soldiers. Other Guard members nearby immediately responded.The White House and nearby federal buildings were briefly placed under lockdown. Mayor Muriel Bowser and FBI director Kash Patel said both soldiers are in critical condition. President Donald Trump confirmed that the suspect was also seriously injured.The FBI is treating the incident as a possible act of terrorism, and the case is being handled as an assault on federal officers. The Trump administration later ordered 500 additional National Guard troops to the city.","The suspect is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021.

Speculations over former Prime Minister Imran Khan's whereabouts are rife across Pakistan after his three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.This comes as several social media handles originating from Afghanistan and Pakistan claimed that Imran has been mysteriously killed inside Adiala Jail.According to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf members, Imran's sisters — Noreen Niazi, Aleema Khan and Dr Uzma Khan — were camped outside Adiala Jail when police personnel assaulted them ""for seeking a meeting with Imran Khan"".""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she said.Meanwhile, thousands of PTI supporters also gathered outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi and raised slogans against the arrest of Imran Khan.Noreen Niazi also accused the police personnel of slapping and dragging women present outside the jail.""Police's conduct was part of a broader and troubling pattern of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years, reflecting a troubling impunity,"" she said.""Police's conduct was wholly criminal, illegal, morally reprehensible, and in direct contradiction to the foundational duties of any law enforcement agency in a democratic society,"" she added.This comes as the government has put a ban on meeting Imran inside jail for over a month. The former Pakistan PM has been in jail since August 2023 in multiple cases.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was not allowed to meet Khan. Afridi made seven consecutive attempts to see him in jail, but he was denied by the jail authorities, whom Khan claims were controlled by an army officer.","Imran Khan's three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.

Women in polygamous marriages: Study reveals what Muslim women experience when husbands bring in more wives

NEW DELHI: The Assam Assembly on Tuesday passed “The Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025,” aiming to ban polygamous marriages across the state and impose strict penalties on those who enter into or conceal a second marriage while the first is still valid.The law, introduced by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the first day of the winter session, will apply statewide except in Sixth Schedule areas and to members of Scheduled Tribes as defined under the Constitution.Speaking before the state assembly approved the bill, Sarma said the legislation, which bans polygamous marriages across most of Assam, is not against Islam. He said the legislation was “irrespective of religion and not against Islam as being perceived by a section”, reported PTI.""Islam can't promote polygamy. If this bill passes, then you will get a chance to be a true Muslim. This bill is not against Islam. The true Islamic people will welcome this Act. Countries like Turkey have also banned Polygamy; there is an arbitration council in Pakistan..."" Sarma said, as cited by ANI.Sarma has also pledged to implement the Uniform Civil Code in Assam if he is re-elected in next year’s assembly polls.""If I return to the assembly as the Chief Minister, I will bring the UCC in the first session of the assembly. I give you my commitment that I will bring the UCC to Assam,"" Sarma added.The bill was introduced amid the absence of opposition MLAs from Congress, CPI(M), and Raijor Dal, who staged a walkout following a discussion on the death of singer Zubeen Garg.The bill defines polygamy as marrying another person while either party already has a valid, existing marriage or a living spouse from whom they are not legally divorced or whose marriage has not been annulled.It states that anyone entering into a polygamous marriage will face up to seven years in prison and a fine, as specified in law.""No person shall marry, if, he has a living spouse or he is not legally separated from the other spouse following due procedure of law, after marriage, or he is a party to a marriage which is not yet dissolved or annulled by a decree of divorce and either has right to appeal or the specified time for appeal has not been expired or is in appeal, or the appeal has been presented but has not yet been dismissed,"" the bill mentions, as cited by ANI.""Whoever abets any offences punishable under this Act or attempts to commit any such offence shall be punishable with the punishment as provided under the Act for the offence of polygamy. Whoever, during the lifetime of his or her spouse or during subsistence of a valid marriage or without having been lawfully divorced from the spouse, or without having been declared the marriage null and void or dissolved, contracts a marriage contravening any of the provisions contained in the Act under Section 4 shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment upto 7 years and a fine,"" the bill adds.","Assam Assembly passes 'Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025' Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma says the legislation is not against Islam.

NEW DELHI: The power tussle for the top post in Karnataka Congress turned ugly on Thursday with chief minister Siddaramaiah taking open potshots at his deputy DK Shivakumar. Hours after Shivakumar posted a cryptic message reminding Siddaramaiah and the Congress high command to ""keep one's word and walk the talk"", the chief minister has hit back using ""word play"" to target his deputy.Earlier today, Shivakumar in a post on X wrote, ""WORD POWER IS WORLD POWER. The biggest force in the world is to keep one’s word. Be it a judge, president or anyone else including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power.""The state Congress president, who is eyeing the top post as part of a ""secret deal"" in 2023 for rotational CM following the party's sweeping victory in the assembly elections, wants Siddaramaiah to honour the commitment made then by the party leadership.Siddaramaiah, who has often asserted that he will complete his term of 5 years, made an interesting response to DKS message. The chief minister used the same words to take potshots at his deputy.""A Word is not power unless it betters the World for the people. The mandate given by the people of Karnataka is not a moment, but a responsibility that lasts five full years. The Congress party , including me, is walking the talk for our people with compassion, consistency, and courage.Our Word to Karnataka is not a slogan, it means the World to us,"" Siddaramaiah wrote on X.Siddaramaiah then went on to list the promises that he had fulfilled as the chief minister in his two tenures.This open social media ""word"" war between the two top state leaders marks a definite shift in their approach. Till now, it was the supporters of the two leaders who were engaging in verbal spats. But with Siddaramaiah completing two-and-a-half years as chief minister, DKS has clearly upped the ante.The ball is in the court of Congress high command, but the open spat between the two leaders could well damage the prospects of the grand-old-party even if it manages to save its government for now.","Siddaramaiah takes open potshots at his deputy DK Shivakumar on social media.

'Islamophobia': Pak Meltdown Over Ayodhya Event Despite Its Own Poor Record of Minority Persecution

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: On Constitution Day, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, speaking at separate functions on Wednesday, called for upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution and uphold the rights of citizens.However, while CM AbdullahAddressing students and faculty at the 50th annual celebration of Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa in Jammu’s Poonch district, Omar said “propaganda and lies” were being spread against Muslim religious institutions in many parts of the country. This was unpatriotic, he added.As the programme began with the national anthem, patriotic songs and Constitutional Day pledges, the CM said, “I wish those people who spread venom against religious educational institutions through social media and the press had been here today to witness this programme. They claim that the institutions like Zia-ul-Uloom teach nothing except communalism, and only impart religious education. But you can see that along with religious studies, they teach science, mathematics and all other subjects. ”On social media, “lies are spread that these institutions promote anti-national sentiment”, where one could see here that the reality was completely different, he said.Omar said symbolic observation of Constitution Day meant nothing if its ideals were not followed.“Today, we observed Constitution Day. It does not mean we remember the Constitution just for one hour; it means we must uphold it every day. The Preamble guarantees equal rights for every religion, equal democratic rights and equality before law for all. But, we are passing through a phase where even education is being given a religious colour, where statements are made that a Muslim shouldn’t study in a medical college or that non-Hindus shouldn’t be admitted in a medical college,” the CM said.He was referring to objections raised by BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal over the admission of Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra. The row erupted after only eight Hindu students from Jammu made it to the first MBBS batch of 50. The admissions were based on the NEET merit list.Omar said Zia-ul-Uloom has always supported the govt and had always helped during natural disasters. During Operation Sindoor, shells fired from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir hit the madrassa on May 7, killing a teacher and wounding three students.LG Sinha, speaking at a function held in Jammu to celebrate 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution, said that after a long wait of 67 years, all provisions of the Constitution were fully implemented in J&K, ending discrimination and injustice. He was referring to the abrogation of Article 370, which granted a special status to J&K, in August 2019.“Those who say what was achieved over the past five years, I want to tell them that the practice of rewarding separatists and torturing patriots has been stopped completely,” the LG said. “Now, J&K is moving ahead guided by ideals of equity, social and economic justice as enshrined in the Constitution by Baba Saheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar.”","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha called for upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and RJD MP Manoj Jha on Thursday told Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to determine citizenship of a voter, yet through an ""unconstitutional"" pan-India Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of state electoral rolls is seeking proof of Indian citizenship from voters.Jha's counsel Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the kind of documents that are being sought from voters through enumeration forms under SIR will disfranchise lakhs and lakhs of voters who would not have documents to show their date of birth, landholding ownership or parents birth certificates. ""That is why we are insisting that Aadhaar must be the basis for enrolment in voter list,"" Sibal said.For Venugopal, senior advocate A M Singhvi said the basis and ground for SIR are both wrong. EC is conducting a pan-India SIR when Representation of the People Act empowers it to conduct it for a constituency. The SC asked if the reason for SIR is to eliminate the dead from the voter list, would such a reason confine the exercise to one constituency or all constituencies?Singhvi, also appearing for TMC MP Mahua Moitra and NGO People's Union for Civil Liberties, agreed with Sibal and said the entire exercise is exclusionary.""EC is conducting this exercise with a figment of imagination that masses of illegal migrants are marauding across India. And, the procedure adopted for conducting this exclusionary exercise is neither prescribed by the Constitution nor the RP Act,"" he said.Venugopal's counsel said, ""There had been several revisions of electoral rolls since 2003. On one hand, EC is not asking those whose names figure in the 2003 voters' list for any document. On the other hand, a voter enrolled after 2003 is being discriminatorily asked to prove everything, including citizenship.""""Through this exercise to illegally seek proof of citizenship, EC is converting itself into a citizenship tribunal, which is beyond its constitutional mandate. EC can supplement the process prescribed in the RP Act, but not supplant it,"" Singhvi said.Sibal said teachers and other govt employees are engaged as booth level officers (BLOs) who have neither the knowledge nor expertise in scrutinising documentary proofs of citizenship nor are they legally empowered to do so as determination of citizenship is entrusted to the ministry of home affairs.Countering Sibal's assertion, EC counsel Eklavya Dwivedi said BLOs do not scrutinise documents. This is being done by electoral registration officers, who are SDM-level bureaucrats. Sibal said it is the BLO who scrutinises documents and sends doubtful cases to ERO. The arguments would continue Tuesday.",Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and RJD MP Manoj Jha told Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to determine citizenship of a voter.

Explosive incidents deepen concerns across Pakistan



Security forces in Pakistan have killed at least 22 militants linked to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) during a major intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military said on Thursday.The raid was launched in Dera Ismail Khan after reports emerged about the presence of members of the group referred to by authorities as “Fitna Al-Khawarij”. According to the military, troops “effectively engaged at the hideout of the terrorists, and after an intense exchange of fire, 22 were eliminated”.Officials said a combing operation was continuing to ensure no other militants remained in the area.The operation came as the province witnessed another series of violent incidents targeting law enforcement. Overnight, militants armed with assault rifles opened fire on a police checkpoint in Hangu district, killing three officers before escaping. Officers returned fire, but it remained unclear whether the attackers suffered casualties, District Police Chief Khan Zeb said.A search effort to track down the assailants is ongoing, with investigators suspecting the Pakistani Taliban, who have been linked to similar assaults in recent years.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the officers killed in Hangu, praising their “bravery and sacrifice” and noting that police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were playing a crucial role in countering militancy.The attack followed a deadly assault days earlier in Peshawar, where two suicide bombers and a gunman stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three officers and injuring 11.In addition to targeted attacks on security forces, civilians have also suffered from a rise in explosions across the country. In Balochistan’s Bolan district, three children were killed when an explosive device detonated outside their home on Wednesday. Police official Jan Mohammad Khosa said investigations were ongoing.Separately, two young men died in Bajaur district after an abandoned landmine exploded in the Jannat Shah area. The victims, identified as Shamshad, 18, and Usman, 22, were passing through when the device went off. Security teams cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those responsible.Pakistan has experienced a marked surge in militant violence in recent years, with officials frequently blaming the TTP. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Afghanistan of allowing the group to operate from its territory, a claim Kabul denies, though tensions have remained high since 2021.",At least 22 militants linked to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) killed in operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused Thursday his own party’s govt in J&K of “failing to fulfil electoral promises and following BJP’s approach of mere political slogans”.Mehdi, critical of the leadership for nearly a year, launched the latest attack from chief minister Omar Abdullah’s assembly constituency Ganderbal as the NC began a two-day working committee meeting under president Farooq Abdullah and the CM, who is also party vice-president.“We sought votes for restoration of constitutional guarantees under Article 370, and it was one of the main reasons we received a huge mandate in the (Oct 2024 assembly) polls. We promised to strive for the release of political prisoners. We must fulfil all commitments. We can’t adopt BJP’s language after coming to office,” the Srinagar MP told supporters in Ganderbal.According to Mehdi, NC’s election campaign last year was centered on Article 370 but it has focused on seeking statehood (restoration) since taking office. “If we shift from Article 370 to statehood, we are aligning with BJP’s line,” the MP argued.Mehdi claimed ignorance about NC’s meeting. “I am a permanent member of the working committee. This is the first time since 2002 that I have not been invited,” the MP said.Mehdi suggested that his disagreements with the party stemmed from his insistence that it must work on the issues over which votes were sought. “A year has passed. We have not worked on our political and governance agenda. We have not rationalised reservations in J&K. We cannot tell open-merit candidates who are crossing the age bar that we still have five years to act,” Mehdi said, adding the govt had not also kept its promise of 200 units of free electricity.Insisting that he was not protesting against his party but reminding it of its promises and manifesto, Mehdi pointed out that J&K’s people had reposed trust in mainstream political parties after a long time last year, handing NC a big mandate that must be honoured.Mehdi brushed away at statements by deputy CM Surinder Choudhary asking the MP to raise issues in Parliament instead of trying to stay in the limelight. “He (Choudhary) was earlier with BJP, then he joined PDP, and now he is in NC. In his politics there is no principle, no direction, no value,” Mehdi said.The MP also criticised the Omar-led govt over a demolition drive in the Valley against settlers, saying people had voted for NC so that “what is happening in Uttar Pradesh does not happen in Kashmir”.","National Conference (NC) MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused his own party’s govt in J&K of “failing to fulfil electoral promises” Mehdi, critical of the leadership for nearly a year, launched the latest attack from chief minister Omar Abdullah's constituency Ganderbal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125622520,imgsize-23028,width-400,resizemode-4/mp-aga-ruhullah-mehdi.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Thursday clarified that his recent social media post on ""word power"" was meant to mark Constitution Day and was addressed to the legal fraternity after chief minister Siddaramaiah countered him thorough a social media post amid ongoing debate over leadership and political messaging.Speaking to reporters, Shivakumar explained the intent behind his post and said, ""Yesterday I was speaking on the our Constitution day. Whatever judges speak, whatever politicians speak, whatever is speak is very much important. I said that all you, all the advocates for all the advocate. I said when you speak you should be. When you convey the message, it should be very important.""His clarification followed a sharp exchange between the two senior leaders that played out publicly. On Wednesday, Shivakumar wrote on X that ""WORD POWER IS WORLD POWER. The biggest force in the world is to keep one’s word. Be it a judge, president or anyone else including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power."" Siddaramaiah responded later using similar phrasing to assert that the mandate belongs to the government for a full term, stressing he intends to complete five years in office.Shivakumar said his post was being read in a political context, but insisted the message was broader.He added, ""That is what I am telling. Whatever we speak in our world that is called Pratikna. That is the word our tongue. That is. I said word power is world power. Wherever in the world. Whatever you speak is very much important. Whatever you also tell in your media also tell. Your anchor also speak. Whether your reporter speak, that is important. That is the power.""The clarification came amid intensifying discussions over leadership transition in Karnataka after the Congress government completed two and a half years in office, a point at which Shivakumar’s supporters believe a rotational understanding from 2023 should take effect. While Siddaramaiah has consistently maintained his intent to serve a full five-year term, Shivakumar's recent remarks and online posts have been interpreted as renewed signalling of his claim to the post.The exchange marked a departure from previous months, where comments had largely come from supporters of both leaders rather than from the two principals themselves. The matter now rests with the Congress high command, as both sides await direction on whether the leadership question will be settled or deferred.","Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Thursday clarified that his recent social media post on ""word power"" was meant to mark Constitution Day.

"Jaipur school suicide: Student sought teacher's help 5 times in last 45 minutes, faced aggressive response, says CBSE report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jaipur-school-suicide-student-sought-teachers-help-5-times-in-last-45-minutes-faced-aggressive-response-says-cbse-report/articleshow/125498920.cms,"Jaipur Shock: 9-Year-Old Girl Dies After Falling From 4th Floor Of Neerja Modi School

Parents allege ‘culture of bullying’ at private school

(With agency inputs)

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, "" it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive""According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.Several parents gathered at Shaheed Smarak Saturday to protest and demand action against Neerja Modi School, where 9-year-old Amaira Kumar fell to her death from the fourth floor on Nov 1. They alleged that incidents of bullying at the school were ""not isolated, but rampant"".","The Central Board of Secondary Education issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

FARIDABAD: The investigation into the Nov 10 Delhi terror attack and the white coat terror module involving doctors has led sleuths to two more hideouts linked to Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, the Al-Falah University professor who was making explosives that were to be used as IEDs in cars.Ganaie, according to investigators, had hid 2,600kg ammonium nitrate at a shed in a field behind a mosque adjoining the Al-Falah University campus for 12 days before shifting it to a cleric's house in Fatehpur Taga, from where it was eventually seized just a day before the Delhi blast.Muzammil had also rented a three-room house in Khori Jamalpur, around 8km from Al-Falah University, in July. This property, which is above a plastic raw materials unit owned by the village's former sarpanch Jumma, was leased for Rs 8,000 a month.Muzammil told the owner he needed the property to start a fruit supply business and intended to bring stocks from Kashmir for local sale. He frequently visited the house, according to investigators, often accompanied by Dr Shahin Shaheed, another Al-Falah doctor linked to the terror module and now in custody of National Investigation Agency (NIA).Although Muzammil introduced her as a family member to the sarpanch, he has confessed to NIA that Shahin is his wife.He vacated the property after three months.Police had earlier found two premises rented by Ganaie in which he kept ammonium nitrate, the larger haul at the cleric's house and a 350kg tranche in a smaller room in Dhauj. Ganaie had also procured a grinder and a portable furnace to process the ammonium nitrate and used it to build explosives. He kept this equipment at the house of a local cab driver he knew.Jumma told investigators that he first encountered Muzammil while seeking treatment for his cancer-stricken nephew at Al-Falah Hospital, where he also met Dr Umar Un Nabi, the Delhi bomber who was in the i20 that blew up outside Red Fort metro station on Nov 10, killing 15 people. Umar was a professor of medicine at Al-Falah.The shed where the ammonium nitrate was initially parked is owned by a local who Muzammil met at the mosque. Muzammil convinced him to allow him to store the sacks at the shed, not telling him what they contained, just items he needed to arrange some space for. It was only when the resident expressed concern about theft that Muzammil shifted the entire stock, along with other materials, to the house of cleric Mohd Istaq in Fatehpur Taga. A joint team of Faridabad police and J&K Police recovered the ammonium nitrate from the cleric's premises on Nov 9.NIA sleuths took Muzammil to Khori Jamalpur, where former sarpanch Jumma identified him. Investigators spent several hours at the location, quizzing the family about Muzammil's visits, his companions and activities inside the rented premises.Investigators said the chemical used in the Delhi blast was sourced from NIT Nehru Ground. NIA conducted a raid on Thursday at BR Scientific and Chemicals, a shop situated in NIT Nehru Ground, Faridabad. Sources indicated that the shop is owned by Lal Babu, a licensed chemical dealer. This store supplies chemicals to laboratories in various hospitals, as well as to colleges and universities. During questioning, Dr. Muzammil disclosed that he had purchased the chemical from this shop. NIA scrutinised the store's records and confiscated several documents for further investigation.","Investigators uncovered two more hideouts linked to Al-Falah University professor Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, who was making IEDs.

Erika Kirk’s Remark About Pregnancy On Megyn Kelly Show Sparks Storm Around Charlie Kirk & JD Vance

Candace Owens’ claims and the Macrons’ lawsuit





Candace Owens says her show will not come on air this week. She says she had to stop the show because she believes French President Emmanuel Macron tried to plan her murder. Candace Owens says she sent a report about this to the White House and to US counterterrorism teams. She also says these offices told her they got her report. These are her words, not confirmed by officials. She shared this update on X. She wrote that her show will be off the air and then said she wants people to know what is happening. Owens says someone close to the French first couple told her that Emmanuel Macron tried to organize the plan to kill her.Owens also says she thinks the Macrons were part of the plan to kill Charlie Kirk . Charlie Kirk was the founder of Turning Point USA. He was killed on September 10, 2025, while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. Owens says the Macrons did not act alone. She said that anyone who did not believe her can now wait for the President of the United States and US intelligence groups to make a statement. She says only then will people know if she is telling the truth.Candace Owens has also said before that Emmanuel Macron paid $1.5 million to hire someone to kill her. Again, these are her claims, and she has not shown public proof.Right now, Candace Owens is dealing with a lawsuit from Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron . They filed this lawsuit because Owens kept saying Brigitte Macron is secretly a man. The lawsuit says Owens posted an eight-part series where she claimed Brigitte Macron was born male, took another woman’s identity, and later had surgery to become female.The lawsuit says these claims are “demonstrably false” and that Candace Owens knew they were false. It says she still posted them to get more fame and attention. The Macrons say her words were meant to hurt them and their family. Their lawyers also say they asked her many times to stop, but she did not.The Macrons say they hope the lawsuit will end what they call a “campaign of defamation” and help set the record straight.Also Read: Candace Owens Recalls College Moment She Felt Feminism Was A Lie And Reveals The Class Blamed Men For All Problems",Candace Owens says her show will not come on air this week.

Investigations reveal that the program has been marred by substantial data inaccuracies and lack of thorough oversight, raising concerns over the vetting process.

DC Shooter’s CIA-Link Sparks Trump's Afghan Immigration Freeze; Biden-Era Policy Under Lens

How Lakanwal came to US

Operation Allies Welcome’s and its flaws

Why was the program created?

After the DC shooting





A federal programme set up during President Joe Biden ’s term is under lens again after officials confirmed that Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspect accused of shooting and critically injuring two National Guard soldiers near the White House, entered US through it.The initiative was known as Operation Allies Welcome and was designed to help Afghans fleeing Taliban retaliation after the fall of Kabul in August 2021. A series of reports suggest the system was riddled with errors that may have allowed individuals to enter with little oversight, according to the New York Post.29-year-old Lakanwal lived in Washington state and arrived in the country through Operation Allies Welcome. A Trump administration official said he applied for asylum in December last year and received approval in April. He had no known criminal history. His background came into light because an ID badge going viral online appeared to show links to the Afghan “Zero Units,” which were elite forces trained and equipped by the CIA.The badge referenced the “Kandahar Strike Force,” known as the 03 Unit, and “Firebase Gecko,” a base once used by US intelligence in Kandahar.CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that the suspect had previously worked “with the US Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”A former senior Afghan general told CBS News the 03 Unit was “the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA,” and operated entirely under CIA command. These units, while trusted by US agencies, were also feared in Afghanistan for alleged extrajudicial killings during night raids.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General report released last year revealed eye-catching problems in the programme. The review found a lot of data errors in the systems used to document Afghans arriving in the US. Some individuals were issued multiple identification numbers or had their names spelled incorrectly. The report said that such glitches made it difficult to track “biographic or criminal history data. ”It stated, “[Immigration] personnel must have accurate information on individuals to ensure the integrity of the adjudication and enforcement processes.” It added that data errors could hinder officials' ability to identify individuals “quickly and accurately.”Once arrivals were inside the country, the report said there was no clear process to monitor when their parole expired. “We found DHS does not have a process to monitor parole expiration for individual OAW parolees and has not designated a component to monitor their parole expiration,” the report said. Officials from CBP, USCIS and ICE all said they believed the responsibility belonged to someone else.Operation Allies Welcome was created to resettle Afghans who had assisted the US during the war and were at risk under Taliban rule. The initiative allowed roughly 90,000 Afghans to become eligible for Special Immigration Visas and provided help with processing and resettlement. Many members of the CIA-linked Zero Units were placed high on evacuation priority lists because they were considered prime targets for Taliban revenge.In the wake of the attack, President Trump said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who entered the country during Biden’s presidency. The White House has not yet commented on the report’s findings.The Taliban government has also not responded to requests for comment regarding Lakanwal’s arrest.Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that the two injured soldiers underwent surgery.","Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, is accused of shooting and critically injuring two National Guard soldiers near the White House.

Pope Leo Condemns Trump Administration's Immigration Crackdown





The Vatican on Tuesday issued a new decree, approved by Pope Leo XIV, reaffirming that Catholics should marry only one spouse for life. It also instructs the faithful not to engage in multiple intimate relationships.Released by the Vatican’s top doctrinal office, the document says marriage must remain a lifelong, exclusive partnership between one man and one woman, a principle binding for all 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide.The decree strongly criticises polygamy, highlighting that the practice persists in some African communities, including among Church members.It stresses that true marriage requires a deep, complete bond that “cannot be shared with others,” according to the Reuters.“Every authentic marriage is a unity composed of two individuals, which requires such an intimate and totalising relationship that it cannot be shared with others,” the decree stated.It added that exclusivity is essential because both partners have “the same dignity and the same rights”.""Since (marriage) is a union between two people who have exactly the same dignity and the same rights, it demands exclusivity,"" the document read.The guidance follows two major Vatican summits held in 2023 and 2024 under the late Pope Francis, where Church leaders discussed how to better uphold Catholic teachings on marriage. Polygamy in parts of Africa and the rise of polyamorous relationships in the West were among the key points of debate.The document argues that polygamy, adultery and polyamory are based on “the illusion that the intensity of the relationship can be found in a succession of faces”.The decree does not address same-sex relationships and instead focuses solely on reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on marriage. It also maintains the Church’s longstanding position against divorce, viewing marriage as a lifelong commitment.However, it clarifies that annulments remain possible and emphasises that no one is expected to remain in an abusive marriage.","Vatican issues new decree reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on marriage.

ARARIA: District additional sessions judge-IV of the Araria judicial division, Rabi Kumar, on Thursday sentenced one Poonam Devi, 35, to death for the cold-blooded and brutal murder of her 11-year-old daughter, Shivani, on the night of July 11, 2023.The courtroom was packed when the judge ruled that the manner in which Poonam poisoned and nearly beheaded her child placed the case in “the rarest of the rare”.Gov additional public prosecutor Prabha Kumari said the tragedy began when Shivani accidentally saw her mother in a compromising position with a man from the same village. Shocked, the child whispered that she would inform her father upon his return from Punjab, where he had gone to earn a livelihood.Fearing exposure and terrified of the consequences, Poonam resolved to silence her daughter. “The love, affection, and sacred bond of motherhood dissolved and collapsed before the convict’s immoral, unsocial and clandestine lust for her paramour. In this gruesome act, motherhood itself stood defeated and disgraced,” the APP said.According to the prosecution, Poonam mixed a highly toxic organophosphorus pesticide into her daughter’s food.Once Shivani fell unconscious, she slit the child’s throat and, with the help of her paramour, hid the body in a maize field behind the house.The trial court recorded statements from five prosecution witnesses and examined 12 documentary exhibits, including the post-mortem report and the Forensic Science Laboratory’s viscera analysis confirming the presence of poison. The court held that the crime demonstrated extreme brutality and a profound moral collapse.None of Shivani’s close relatives informed the police. Instead, a villager acted as a Good Samaritan and approached the authorities, becoming the informant in the case. Based on his written statement, Narpatganj police registered a case. The case proceeded on fast-track trial, culminating in Thursday’s sentencing.While pronouncing the verdict, judge Rabi Kumar said the heinous act committed by a mother against her own child “shakes the conscience of society” and warrants the severest punishment under law.","Poonam Devi, 35, was sentenced to death for the cold-blooded and brutal murder of her 11-year-old daughter, Shivani.

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar remain on standby for a formal call from Delhi, as the Congress high command prepares to resolve the tussle in Karnataka.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had announced a meeting and Siddaramaiah said he was ready to travel if summoned. Shivakumar echoed him, saying, ""The CM and I will discuss and we will go (to Delhi). If they (high command) call, we will go.""Sources say the meeting is tentatively scheduled for Saturday in Delhi, though it hinges on the availability of Rahul Gandhi , whose itinerary remains uncertain.Siddaramaiah kept to his official duties Thursday, chairing multiple meetings and avoiding direct comments on the issue. But sources say he held a closed-door discussion late Wednesday with ministers considered close to him, including G Parameshwara, Satish Jarkiholi, HC Mahadevappa, K Venkatesh and former minister KN Rajanna, at his residence.In related developments, MLC BK Hariprasad met Jarkiholi and Mahadevappa. Jarkiholi, who was in Haveri, said party workers had urged the high command to intervene swiftly. Law minister HK Patil said he would speak with Kharge if consulted.As shadowboxing intensified, caste-based organisations openly weighed in, issuing warnings and staking claims on behalf of Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. Karnataka State Federation of Backward Class Communities (KSFBCC) cautioned Congress that unseating Siddaramaiah would trigger repercussions.KM Ramachandrappa, KSFBCC president, said Ahinda communities were distressed by ongoing developments. ""These threats are not new. They have been happening since Independence. We, downtrodden communities, will not be cowed by threats,"" he said.He also referred to recent remarks by Karnataka Rajya Vokkaligara Sangha president L Srinivas, who said the Congress high command should offer a ‘coolie' (token of reward) for the work Shivakumar had done in the 2023 polls. In response, Ramachandrappa said Shivakumar had already received his ‘coolie' in the form of the deputy CM post.Expressing concern over the political manoeuvring, he said, ""Those against the caste census are trying to unseat the CM. We can only assume how they will behave with our communities. Ahinda is deeply pained. If these developments continue, it will be problematic for Congress. Ahinda will not sit idle.""He added that if pontiffs and Vokkaliga Sangha members staged protests, Ahinda organisations would not remain passive either.Earlier, Vokkaligara Sangha urged Congress brass to elevate Shivakumar as CM, asserting that the party's strong performance in Old Mysuru region in the 2023 polls stemmed from his leadership. Sangha president Srinivas said Shivakumar had worked ""tirelessly day and night"" and deserved recognition. ""If Shivakumar is denied the CM post, the community, under the guidance of seers, will protest,"" he said.Former president B Kenchappagowda echoed the sentiment. While acknowledging Siddaramaiah's leadership, he insisted Shivakumar must not be denied his turn. ""If he is sidelined unfairly, the community will teach Congress a lesson in the next election,"" he said.","Chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar remain on standby for a formal call from Delhi.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the residents had been complaining of ill-health for the past three weeks, and fingers were pointed towards the water being supplied to them.Bengaluru South City corporation officials, who are monitoring the situation in the apartment, said the boy had been suffering from nephrotic syndrome for the last two years and was being treated with antibiotics and steroids.The prolonged ill health, worsened by the alleged deterioration in water quality, resulted in his death.Officials have set up a health desk at the apartment, held discussions with members of the apartment association, and deployed doctors to handle medical emergencies. Water samples have been collected and sent for testing.Meanwhile, several residents complained about the apathy they faced following the outbreak. ""I've been sick for the past 45 days... I got sick 6-7 times and have been spending most of the time in hospitals; the same goes for my parents. We've been complaining about it for the past two months and no serious action has been taken,"" a resident stated while pointing out that at least around 800 residents have fallen sick recently.","The incident occurred at Prestige Falcon City apartment, off Kanakapura Road.

"Elon Musk’s DOGE shuts down: What happens to Musk’s high profile hires that cut 200,000 US government jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-doge-shuts-down-what-happens-to-musks-high-profile-hires-that-cut-200000-us-government-jobs/articleshow/125534543.cms,"Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

From chainsaws to silence: DOGE's brief tenure



DOGE staff scattered across government as agency dissolves







The Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk that dominated the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter, according to Reuters, in what appears to be the administration's ultimate cost-saving measure.""That doesn't exist,"" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters when asked about DOGE's status, confirming it is no longer a ""centralised entity."" The OPM has since absorbed many of DOGE's functions, marking the end of an agency that promised sweeping government reform but delivered questionable results.Created in January through executive order, DOGE was expected to operate through July 2026. The agency made dramatic efforts to shrink federal agencies, cut budgets, and redirect work to Trump priorities in its early months. Elon Musk, who initially led the department, regularly promoted its work on social media and famously brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, declaring it ""the chainsaw for bureaucracy. ""DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but outside financial experts found it impossible to verify these claims because the unit never provided detailed public accounting.The agency's website still claims approximately $214 billion in savings, though a Politico review found the numbers were inflated by counting maximum possible contract values rather than actual spending reductions.The shut down follows Musk's public feud with Trump in May, after which Musk left Washington and exited DOGE. Musk's ""right-hand man,"" Steve Davis , also departed shortly after his boss's exit.By May, more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts.Former DOGE employees have moved to new positions throughout the administration. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia now heads Trump's National Design Studio, tasked with beautifying government websites. So far, his design studio has launched websites to recruit law enforcement officers to patrol Washington, D.C., and advertise the president's drug pricing program.Edward Coristine, a DOGE employee nicknamed ""Big Balls,"" has also joined Gebbia's National Design Studio effort, encouraging his followers on X to apply to the new body.Acting DOGE Administrator Amy Gleason formally became an adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March, according to court filings, with her public statements largely focused on her HHS role. Zachary Terrell, part of the DOGE team given access to government health systems early in Trump's second term, is now chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, while Rachel Riley, who had similar access, now serves as chief of the Office of Naval Research.Jeremy Lewin, who helped Musk dismantle the US Agency for International Development, now oversees foreign assistance at the State Department. Scott Langmack, DOGE's representative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been tasked by the White House budget office with creating custom AI applications to analyze US regulations and determine which ones to eliminate, according to his LinkedIn profile.The government-wide hiring freeze, another hallmark of DOGE, has also ended, with Kupor stating there is no longer a target for workforce reductions.Spokeswoman Liz Huston told Reuters only that Trump ""continues to actively deliver"" on reducing waste and fraud. Trump himself has begun referring to DOGE in the past tense in recent statements to reporters, subtly signaling its demise without formal acknowledgment.","Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter.

Protest to continue till 3 other demands are met: Morcha

CHANDIGARH: After 26 days of dharnas, shutdowns and showdowns, Panjab University on Thursday received formal approval for the Senate election schedule from the Chancellor, Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan - a major step in resolving the agitation that began earlier this month.The mood on campus immediately shifted from tension to celebration, but PU Bachao Morcha said its protest was not yet over, and that further negotiations would take place on three pending demands.The notification, issued by the Vice-President's Secretariat and conveyed to Vice-Chancellor Prof Renu Vig, confirms the schedule proposed by PU in its letter dated Nov 9. With this, the university can now begin preparations for elections that have been pending since the Senate term expired on Oct 31, 2024. Voting schedule is from Sept 7 to Oct 4 next year.Sweets and victory slogans went around in equal measure at the dharna site outside the V-C’s office, where the Morcha has dug in since the first week of November. Several student leaders termed the development “historic” and said it vindicated the weeks-long mobilisation. During the celebrations, V-C Vig briefly stepped out to meet the protesters and urged them to call off the dharna.In her statement, Prof Vig said: “Gratitude to the Hon’ble Chancellor for approving the Senate elections of Panjab University. This decision marks an important step in the interest of a positive academic environment. The Panjab University administration is always with its students and teaching community.”However, the Morcha said the protest would continue until it received written assurance on three pending matters: quashing of FIRs against 14 students booked during a previous Senate protest in 2024, rollback of recently introduced SOPs regulating elections and student activities, and scrapping of the committee formed to review demands raised by Haryana students regarding representation and possible college re-affiliation.A meeting with university officials has been scheduled for Thursday. A senior PU administrator confirmed that authorities will also have discussions with Haryana students.The Morcha had earlier announced that its next phase of agitation would move outside campus, with gheraos of BJP offices in Chandigarh and Punjab planned for Dec 3. Leaders said that plan remains in place “subject to progress” in Friday’s discussion.Thursday’s development follows a tense fortnight in which examinations were postponed twice, gates were blocked and more than 300 security personnel — including Chandigarh Police, Rapid Action Force and even Indo-Tibetan Border Police — were deployed on campus.The first flashpoint was the Centre notifying a controversial restructuring of the PU governing bodies. After protests, it was withdrawn a week later, but the protests didn’t end as students began demanding notification of senate elections.With the schedule now approved, focus is expected to shift from street mobilisation to operational work, including rolls, constituencies and polling logistics ahead of next year’s electoral calendar.",Panjab University receives formal approval for Senate election schedule.

J.D. Vance’s Daughter Goes Viral After Adorable Thanksgiving Moment With Troops





US vice president JD Vance told troops in Kentucky on Wednesday that he plans to deep-fry a turkey this Thanksgiving because “it doesn’t actually taste that good”.Saying that Thanksgiving was “probably my favourite American holiday” and the “most uniquely American” one, Vance asked the crowd if they liked Thanksgiving turkey.“How many times do you roast an 18-pound turkey randomly?” he asked. “Nobody does it because turkey doesn’t actually taste that good.”He said he had spoken to a soldier who planned to deep-fry her turkey and decided he would try the same at home this year.The vice president, however, said that “If you’ve got to deep-fry something to make it taste good, it probably isn’t that good. That’s a pretty good rule of thumb.”He then compared it with chicken, saying it “tastes good all the time,” fried or not.Vance's comment echoed last year’s viral moment from health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who posted a video on X showing how he cooks his turkey “the MAHA way.” MAHA is an acronym for ""Make America Healthy Again,"" which is a movement and health plan promoted by Kennedy.On Thursday morning, Vance wrote on X, “Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! I'm grateful for all of you, for the people who keep us safe, for our incredible country, and most of all for the grace of God and my beautiful family! Don’t eat too much!”","US vice president JD Vance told troops in Kentucky on Wednesday that he plans to deep-fry a turkey this Thanksgiving because “it doesn’t actually taste that good” He compared it with chicken, saying it “tastes good all the time,” fried or not.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125628094,imgsize-208316,width-400,resizemode-4/jd-vance-with-soldiers-on-base.jpg"

Trump Warns Allies On Migration After Shocking Attack Near White House By Afghan Man





US president Donald Trump on Thursday blasted a reporter who asked why he blamed the Biden administration for Wednesday’s shooting near the White House.“Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” Trump asked, adding, “Because they came in on a plane along with thousands of other people that shouldn’t be here. And you’re just asking questions because you’re a stupid person.”Trump criticised the vetting process during Biden, saying: “And there’s a law passed that it’s almost impossible not to get them out. You can’t get them out once they come in. And they came in and they were unvetted. They were unchecked. There were many of them. And they came in on big planes. And it was disgraceful.”Trump also spoke about the Afghanistan withdrawal: “And frankly, the whole thing was a mess. The whole Afghanistan situation was a mess. It should have never taken place if we’re going to go out. And we would have gone out because I had everybody ready to go. We were going to go out with strength and dignity and precision.Trump repeated his claim that the US should have kept Bagram, “because of its very close relationship to China and where they make their missiles. But when you let the people come in by the thousands and thousands and thousands, they made a terrible mistake.They were incompetent.”The suspect in Wednesday's shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, entered the US on 8 September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a resettlement programme launched after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lakanwal had previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan.The shooting occurred Wednesday afternoon a few blocks from the White House, near 17th Street NW and I Street NW, close to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, killing one National Guard member and leaving a second critically injured.","The suspect in Wednesday's shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, entered the US on 8 September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome.

National Guard Shot: Shocking Eyewitness Account; ‘They Had Somebody Pinned Down' | Washington DC'

Troops subdued the shooter

Witnesses describe chaos

Trump vows consequences





NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday condemned the shooting at White House of two National Guard soldiers and said that the suspect from Afghanistan entered the country in 2021. Calling it 'an act of terror', he urged to reinvestigate all Afghan refugees that entered under the Biden admin after the National Guard shooting.In his address from Florida, Trump said, ""Earlier today on the eve of the thanksgiving holiday, two members of the National Guard serving in Washington DC were shot at point blank range in a monstrous, ambush styled attack just steps away from the White House. This heinous assault was an act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation, it was a crime against humanity. The hearts of all Americans tonight are with those two members of the West Virginian National Guards and their families. ""Trump said that as the country is filled with anguish and grief for those shot at, ""we're also filled with rightous anger and ferocious resolve"".He said that as the President of the United States, ""the animal who perpetrated this atrocity, pays the steepest possible price.I can report tonight based on the best available information, the Department of homeland security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan- a hellhole on earth.""Trump alleged that the Afghan person was flown in by the Biden administration in 2021, ""on those infamous flights.... his status was extended under legislations signed by President Biden"" and added, ""this attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation. The last administration let in 20 million unknown foreigners from all over the world"".He said that US will now re-examine every single alien who has entered the US from Afghanistan under Biden administration and ensure removal of those who don't love America.""We are not going to put up on these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn't even be in our country. We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can't love our country, we don't want them. America will never bend or yield in the face of terror. At the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission the service members were so nobly fulfilling.""He announced that he has directed the Department of War to mobilise and additional 500 troops ""to help protect our capital city. We will make America totally safe again and we will bring the perpetrator of this barbaric attack to swift and certain justice if the bullets going in the opposite direction haven't already done that.""He said that the Guards were serving their duty to protect the nation, when they were ""gunned down in a savage attack"" and asked people to say a prayer this Thanksgiving for them.Two members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed to the nation’s capital were shot Wednesday afternoon just a few blocks from the White House, in what officials described as a bold and targeted attack. FBI director Kash Patel and Washington mayor Muriel Bowser said both service members were hospitalized in critical condition.The unusual shooting of National Guard personnel—on the eve of Thanksgiving—comes amid months of controversy over the presence of Guard troops in Washington and other US cities. Their deployment by the Trump administration has fueled legal battles and a broader debate over the use of military forces to address what officials have labeled a spiraling crime problem.A suspect, who was taken into custody, was also wounded in the confront ation. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, according to AP.Hours later, in a video message posted on social media, President Donald Trump called for a reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees admitted under the Biden administration.“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,” he said, calling the shooting “a crime against our entire nation.”DC police executive assistant chief Jeffrey Carroll said investigators have not determined a motive. Video reviewed by authorities showed the gunman “rounding the corner” and opening fire on the troops almost immediately. “This was a targeted shooting,” Bowser said.West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially announced the troops had died, but later amended his statement, saying his office was receiving “conflicting reports” about their condition.The Trump administration responded by ordering an additional 500 National Guard members to Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had directed him to send more troops. Nearly 2,200 Guard members are currently assigned to the city’s joint task force, according to the latest government update.The shooting occurred about two blocks northwest of the White House, near a metro station. Carroll said other Guard members nearby heard the gunshots, rushed to the scene, and restrained the gunman after he had been shot.“It appears to be a lone gunman who raised a firearm and ambushed these National Guard members,” Carroll said, adding that investigators have not yet determined whether the suspect was shot by a Guard member or a police officer.“At this point we have no other suspects,” he said.At least one Guard member exchanged gunfire with the attacker, according to another law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cellphone video shared on social media shortly after the attack showed first responders performing CPR on one Guard member and treating the other on a sidewalk littered with broken glass.Stacy Walters, who was sitting in her car nearby, said she heard two shots and saw people running before law enforcement rapidly descended on the scene. “It’s such a beautiful day. Who would do this? And right before the holidays?” she said.Emma McDonald, who had just exited a metro station when the shots were fired, said she and others sheltered inside a café. Minutes later, she saw first responders rush past, pushing a stretcher carrying a badly wounded Guard member.From Florida, where he is spending Thanksgiving, Trump called the gunman an “animal” who “will pay a very steep price.” “God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People,” he wrote on Truth Social.Speaking in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, vice president JD Vance asked people of faith to pray for the wounded. He noted that much remains unknown, including the motive.“It’s a somber reminder that our soldiers—active duty, reserve, or National Guard—are the sword and shield of the United States,” Vance told troops gathered for a Thanksgiving message.Gen. Steven Nordhaus, chief of the National Guard Bureau, canceled planned holiday visits to troops at Guantanamo Bay so he could travel to Washington to be with Guard members there.In August, Trump issued an emergency order federalizing the local police force and deploying Guard units from eight states and the District of Columbia. Although the order expired a month later, the troops stayed. Last week, a federal judge ordered the deployment to end, but paused her ruling for 21 days to allow time for an appeal or for the administration to withdraw the troops.Guard members have been patrolling neighborhoods, transit stations, and other areas; staffing highway checkpoints; and even assisting with trash collection and security at sporting events.","US President Donald Trump condemned the shooting at White House of two National Guard soldiers and said that the suspect from Afghanistan entered the country in 2021.

Here are the top developments

Toll rises to 44

Three arrested

Rescue ops ongoing

Styrofoam fanned the flames





The death toll in the massive fire in multiple high rises in Hong Kong rose to 44, with over 270 hundred still missing. Later, several media outlets reported arrest of 3 people in connection to the fire.Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.State media reported that Xi called on authorities to “make every effort” to put out the fire and minimise further loss of life.“Xi Jinping expressed condolences for those who died in the major fire at a residential estate in Tai Po District, New Territories, Hong Kong, including the firefighter who died in the line of duty,” it said.The death toll in the incident was revised to 44, after initial count of 36, while 279 are reported missing.Police have arrested three men on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the blaze, as reported by South China Morning Post. Police announced the arrests in a brief, one-sentence advisory that did not detail the suspects’ alleged actions, and said more information would be provided at a later press conference.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee confirmed the rising toll and said that search teams were still tracing missing residents as smoke continued to billow from the charred towers.The Fire Services Department said it received the first emergency call at 2:51 pm local time and escalated the blaze to a No 4 alarm at 3:34 pm, one level below the highest emergency classification. Dozens of engines, ambulances and rescue teams were deployed as smoke poured from the towers, which house around 2,000 apartments and were undergoing renovation work.“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate the cause of the fire,” said John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, as quoted by AP.Witnesses described seeing residents gathered on overhead walkways as flames climbed rapidly up buildings covered in bamboo scaffolding. The Tai Po district, home to nearly 300,000 people, is among Hong Kong’s most tightly packed urban zones.Roads around the area remain closed, with bus routes diverted as firefighters continue sweeping each floor to locate survivors. More details are awaited as authorities verify the number of missing residents and assess structural safety before entering deeper sections of the complex.The blaze tore through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Tai Po on Wednesday, with flames and thick smoke engulfing the 32-storey blocks for more than ten hours.Fire Services Director Andy Yeung Yan-kin said officers found styrofoam inside the burning buildings, which he believes intensified the blaze. According to the South China Morning Post, the material allowed flames to race through corridors and ignite flats across multiple levels. Yeung noted that firefighters could only enter from the ground floor as many floors were still burning well into the early hours of Thursday. One of the biggest challenges, he said, was the number of levels alight simultaneously.Security Secretary Chris Tang called the fire’s speed “suspicious”. Preliminary checks, he said, showed that the building’s netting and waterproof tarpaulin burned far faster than regulated materials. “We found that the netting and waterproof tarpaulin on the building walls, once ignited, spread flames much faster than they should. This is unusual,” Tang said. He confirmed that police and fire officers would conduct a full investigation, including a criminal probe into any irregularities.Read more: What caused the Hong Kong fire that killed 36 and left hundreds missing","Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.

US president Donald Trump said on Thursday that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard soldiers shot near the White House a day earlier, had died of her injuries.

The Trump administration has ordered a sweeping review of all green cards issued to people from 19 countries it classifies as “of concern”, escalating its immigration clampdown following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC.Joseph Edlow, director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, said he acted on President Donald Trump’s direction and had instructed a “full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern”. His announcement came hours after the attack, which the president has already cited as justification for tightening entry rules.Officials said that the list of 19 countries matches those named in a June presidential proclamation, which imposed full or partial suspensions on the entry of nationals from:When pressed for details, USCIS pointed to that proclamation, which cited high visa overstay rates, lack of cooperation on removals, weak vetting systems and security concerns, including terrorism threats.The move follows the brazen attack on Wednesday in which two West Virginia National Guard members — Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24 — were critically injured. Both had been deployed to the capital as part of Trump’s crime-fighting mission, which placed nearly 2,200 Guard troops under federal control. West Virginia’s governor, Patrick Morrisey, initially announced that the pair had died before later amending his statement, saying his office had received “conflicting reports”.Authorities identified the suspect as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who drove across the country to launch what prosecutors described as an “ambush-style” attack using a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. Video reviewed by investigators showed him turning a corner and opening fire immediately. Troops returned fire, subdued him and handed him over to police. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, and investigators have yet to identify a motive.Lakanwal arrived in the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era programme established after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He applied for asylum during the Biden administration but, according to #AfghanEvac, his case was approved under Trump. Officials say he had passed all background checks, including those conducted before his work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, where he had links to CIA-backed Zero Units. Those units were known for frontline operations and heavy involvement in the final days of the U.S. withdrawal.Lakanwal faces charges including assault with intent to kill while armed. U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro said charges could be upgraded: “We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree.”Trump has ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops into Washington. A federal judge has already ordered the wider deployment to end but has paused her ruling for 21 days to allow the administration time to appeal or withdraw the forces.","The move follows the brazen attack on Wednesday in which two West Virginia National Guard members — Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24 — were critically injured.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani opened up about his transition, political pressures and even his Bollywood music knowledge, at one point dropping into the iconic Shah Rukh Khan pose, in an exclusive conversation with British journalist Mehdi Hasan.The interview was recorded inside his campaign headquarters that he will soon vacate and marks Mamdani’s first major sit-down since his election victory earlier this month against independent candidate Andrew Cuomo.The Zeteo interview also featured a fun Bollywood guessing game. Hasan quizzed him on Indian classics like Chaiyya Chaiyya, featuring Shah Rukh Khan. It was a fitting moment for a politician whose victory speech itself ended with the iconic beat of Dhoom Machale.Mamdani was polling at just 1 per cent last December before an appearance on Hasan’s show sent his campaign viral.

He also shed light on growing normalisation of Islamophobia and said he is seriously worried about the security of his phone number.Speaking about national politics, Mamdani threw an interesting and contrasting point of the two major parties. He said that Republicans tend to approach politics with an imagination that keeps expanding, pointing to ideas as absurd as buying Greenland. Democrats, he argued, often seem trapped in a mindset where the sense of what is possible keeps shrinking. He said, “Republicans, they have a sense of imagination that is ever-expanding. It can extend to purchasing Greenland. And Democrats, it feels as if we are often in an exercise of an ever-lowering ceiling of possibility.”","New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani opens up about his transition, political pressures and even his Bollywood music knowledge.

How asylum is granted in the US





FBI director Kash Patel sidestepped a crucial question on how DC shooting suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an immigrant from Afghanistan who came to the US in 2021, was granted asylum by the Donald Trump administration in 2025. When Patel was asked whether the authorities missed any signs while granting asylum, Patel did not address the heart of the controversy that though Lakanwal was allowed to enter the US by the Biden administration but was granted asylum by the Trump administration. But he tactfully passed the buck on the previous administration.“Well, you miss all the signs when you do absolutely zero vetting - and that's exactly what happened in this case,"" Patel said.“When the prior administration made the decision to allow thousands of people in without doing a single piece of background checking in your vetting, that's how you miss every single sign,"" the FBI director said.People who can prove to the administration that they are being persecuted in their country can get asylum in the US within a year of arriving in the US. For individual cases, there is a strong vetting process in place but Lakanwal came to the US not as an individual but along with many who were welcomed to the US in 2021 under Joe Biden's Operation Allies Welcome.This happened after the US military withdrew forces from Afghanistan and the government collapsed, giving in to the Taliban power.Over 70,000 Afghan nationals were allowed into the US under the program which was vetted by US counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies. But Republican leaders claimed that there was no background check as the evacuation was rushed.Under the Operation Allies Welcome program, Afghans evacuated to the US were granted a two-year ""parole"" that allowed them to live and work legally and then apply for a more permanent status. Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was granted asylum in April this year. He had no known crminal historty and the government file of Lakanwal said he had been vetted by the US because of his work with US government partners during the war in Afghnistan.","DC shooting suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an immigrant from Afghanistan, came to the US in 2021.

Another Indian-origin truck driver in the US, Sukhjinder Singh , has been taken into ICE custody for possible deportation, months after he caused a fatal crash and then pleaded guilty to the vehicular manslaughter that took place earlier this year in West Virginia. Singh was sentenced to the maximum of one year in jail after he pleaded guilty in October. According to the latest report, Singh is now in ICE custody in the North Central Regional Jail.The crash took place in January when Kevin Lataille, a Pennsylvania man, was reported missing while driving home from work in West Virginia. Lataille's body was found submerged in Cheat Lake after an extensive search along with his car, week after he went missing.A wrong person by the same name Sukhjinder Singh was arrested initially but then the real suspect was arrested and he told the cops that he lost control of his vehicle due to severe snowstorm conditions.The surveillance footage of the incident showed a large vehicle sliding on the bridge, throwing snow into the air, followed by a passenger vehicle falling from the bridge into the lake. The detectives concluded that Singh's tractor was traveling at an unsafe speed on the snow-covered road and some witnesses, they said, called his driving ""reckless and even criminal"".Investigators also confirmed that Singh's tractor struck another vehicle before reaching the bridge and failing to stop.""Lataille's vehicle was examined further.

'WON'T TOLERATE': Ramaphosa Launches Brutal Attack On Trump; South Africa Tears Into US Over G20 Ban





: Bluntly accusing the South African government of genocide of white people, US President Donald Trump said he would bar the country from attending the G-20 summit in Miami late next year, throwing the world's main forum for international economic cooperation, of which India is a part, into turmoil.In an angry social media post, the US President, who boycotted the just concluded G-20 meet in Johannesburg, said he did not attend because the South African Government ""refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch, French, and German settlers.”“To put it more bluntly, they are killing white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them,” he alleged. The narrative, mostly from a small minority of white nationalists in South Africa and US., has been widely debunked by independent observers amid acknowledgment that the country faces a law-and-order situation.The US President further maintained that South Africa “has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership anywhere,” and said he will “stop all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately.”U.S aid to Pretoria, mostly in the health sector, peaked at $ 564 million in 2024 before tailing off to a planned $ 103 million in 2025 amid deteriorating ties underscored by an Oval Office ambush of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa where Trump showed him a multimedia presentation of ""white genocide.” Ramaphosa maintained that the farm attacks were part of broader crime affecting all races and the allegations Trump referenced was from a ""small minority party"" not reflective of government policy.Ramaphosa’s narrative was backed by golfing greats Ernie Els and Retief Goosen (brought in to appeal to Trump's love of golf) and billionaire Johann Rupert (South Africa’s richest man) even as Trump surrogate Elon Musk, who has promoted the white genocide allegations, glowered over them. “I am sorry I don’t have a plane to give you,” Ramaphosa joked at one point during the meeting, referring to a story at that time about Trump receiving a jet from Qatar. “I wish you did,” the U.S President kidded back.But beyond the banter ties continued to sour, with Trump taking exception to what he claimed was South Africa’s refusal to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from the U.S. Embassy, who attended the closing ceremony in Johannesburg. Ramaphosa rejected the charges saying the “instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official,” amid doubts over whether the Miami event will take place at all given the growing fissures in global politics and the adversarial position the U.S has taken on several fronts.In a blistering rebuttal to Trump’s effort to evict South Africa from the G-20, Ramaphosa said the country is a member of the group “on its own name and right” and called on other member nations to reaffirm its continued operation in the spirit of multilateralism, based on consensus, with all members participating on an equal footing in all of its structure. “South Africa… does not appreciate insults from another country about its membership and worth in participating in global platforms,” he lashed back.Legal and institutional norms surrounding the G20 cast serious doubt on the possibility and legitimacy of a unilateral ban on South Africa by Trump. The G20 is an informal, consensus-based forum without a binding charter or formal exclusion mechanism. No single member state — including the U.S — has the right to expel another, a fact that has been widely acknowledged in prior controversies, such as attempts to exclude Russia, where other members, including China, defended Russia’s status. The U.S is currently feuding with several other G-20 members including Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, with on-off spats with Russia, China, and India.",U.S aid to Pretoria peaked at $ 564 million in 2024 before tailing off to a planned $ 103 million in 2025 amid deteriorating ties underscored by an Oval Office ambush of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa.

'Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against The Law'





American companies are being warned to stop ignoring domestic American workers in favour of H-1B visa holders. This ultimatum could bring federal penalties as the Trump administration expands its new enforcement drive known as Project Firewall.The initiative was a nudge by US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to clamp down on hiring practices that discriminate against Americans.The Department of Labor said the EEOC has released new rules to remind employers that favouring foreign workers and H-1B holders may violate federal law. The move follows the launch of Project Firewall, which is aimed at protecting the rights and wages of highly skilled American workers and ensuring they are prioritised for jobs.“I applaud the EEOC for standing with the Department of Labor’s mandate under Project Firewall to ensure American workers have a fair chance to compete and succeed,” said Labour Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue working with our federal partners to put an end to bad practices and safeguard opportunities for American workers.”The EEOC’s chair, Andrea Lucas, said the scale of unlawful hiring bias against American citizens required a strong federal response.“With the scale of unlawful anti-American discrimination we’re seeing, robust investigation and enforcement within the EEOC and with our federal partners is essential to protecting America’s workforce,” she said.The EEOC published a new one-page document titled “Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against The Law” and updated its national origin discrimination information hub. These resources explain how discrimination can occur in forms such as job ads, hiring, harassment or retaliation. They rest on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, existing policy guidance and Supreme Court rulings.The EEOC’s warned that many employers maintain policies that illegally prefer migrants, illegal aliens or non-immigrant guest workers over Americans. “Nothing justifies illegal national origin discrimination whether rooted in cost of labour, customer preferences, or stereotypes,” she said.The EEOC reminded workers that they can file discrimination complaints through its website and noted that it has the authority to investigate and take action against private employers. For state and local government agencies, the EEOC shares responsibility with the Department of Justice (DOJ).",The initiative was a nudge by US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to clamp down on hiring practices that discriminate against Americans.
