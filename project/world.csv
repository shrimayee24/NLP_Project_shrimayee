The incident occurred as a massive crowd gathered after the announcement of a special train, leading to chaos within 15-20 minutes.Among the 15 casualties in the incident, three were children, according to the chief casualty medical officer of LNJP Hospital.The situation unfolded due to a huge rush of passengers who had reached the station to board special trains for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj. Some passengers fainted amid the sudden surge, sparking rumours of a stampede-like situation and further fuelling panic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X and said he was ""distressed"" by the stampede. ""Distressed by the stampede at New Delhi Railway Station. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede,"" PM Modi said.Following the incident, a call was made to the Delhi Fire Service, prompting the deployment of four fire tenders to the scene. Injured and fainted passengers were promptly taken to nearby hospitals by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Delhi Police.The situation has since been brought under control, according to DCP Railway KPS Malhotra, who explained that the crowd surge was triggered by the delay of two trains and an unexpected influx of passengers.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced a high-level investigation into the incident and confirmed that four special trains were arranged to manage the unprecedented rush, with more on standby. In a tweet, he stated, “4 special trains to evacuate this unprecedented sudden rush at NDLS.

Stuck in Mexico, he made a desperate call home. ""Give them the power of attorney,"" he had told Kamalpreet. ""Otherwise, they won't let me leave.""A demand wrapped in a threat, leaving them no choice but to surrender their 4.5 acres in Kurala Kalan village in Punjab's Hoshiarpur district to the local travel agent who had promised Daljit a future abroad.

What was written in OHCHR report?



Deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blamed Bangladesh's interim government leader Muhammad Yunus for the country's ""lawlessness"" and vowed to return back to her country.During a one-on-one interaction on Zoom with widows of four policemen killed during last July’s student uprising, Hasina claimed Yunus has ""unleashed terrorists"" on its citizens, PTI news agency reported.Hasina's 16-year Awami League administration ended following a student uprising on August 5, 2024, forcing her to seek refuge in India.Hasina said, ""He (Yunus) dissolved all inquiry committees and unleashed terrorists to butcher people. They are destroying Bangladesh.""The conversation, which surfaced on social media on Tuesday, showed Hasina comforting grieving family members whilst expressing her intention to return and seek justice for the fallen officers.""I will return and avenge the deaths of our policemen,"" she declared, noting that she had narrowly escaped death during her government's collapse, attributing her survival to divine intervention ""to do something good.""""Yunus has no experience in running a government,"" the former prime minister stated, adding, ""We need to put an end to this lawlessness.""In previous social media appearances, Hasina accused Yunus of orchestrating ""a long, and well-designed plot to oust her government and grab the state power.""Meanwhile, the office of Bangladesh's interim government said on Tuesday that securing the extradition of Sheikh Hasina from India was their top priority.""This is the government's top priority,"" chief adviser Yunus' press secretary Shafiqul Alam said during a media briefing that the administration would persist in its attempts to bring Hasina back for a personal trial.During the briefing, he indicated that whilst the Bangladeshi public and political organisations would determine the future of her ""fascist"" Awami League, individuals allegedly responsible for killings, forced disappearances and other offences must face legal consequences.The spokesperson referenced the Office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights' (OHCHR) fact-finding report from the previous week, which indicated Hasina's involvement in crimes against humanity during her leadership.According to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), he noted that following the publication of UN and human rights organisations' reports, there was increased pressure for India to return Hasina to Bangladesh.The UN human rights office (OHCHR) issued a report last week detailing the unrest in Bangladesh that resulted in approximately 1,400 fatalities. The report was titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to the Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.The document examined events from July 1 to August 15, encompassing student protests demanding Hasina's removal and subsequent attacks on Awami League supporters and minority groups, including Hindus.The findings revealed that the Awami League administration under Hasina responded with severe measures against protesters, resulting in ""hundreds of extrajudicial killings.""Police headquarters, now substantially reorganised under the interim administration, confirmed that a minimum of 44 police personnel, including officers, lost their lives during the upheaval.The UN report indicated that 450 of the nation's 639 police stations suffered destruction or damage from mob violence during the period surrounding the Awami League government's collapse.""After Sheikh Hasina left the country on August 5 last year, revenge violence surged,"" stated the OHCHR report, noting that violent groups attacked and set fire to numerous police facilities.The UN rights office reported that in numerous instances, police personnel either abandoned their posts or received permission to leave from their commanders, whilst in other situations, officers faced mob violence resulting in their deaths.","Deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blames interim government leader Muhammad Yunus for the country's ""lawlessness"" Hasina's 16-year Awami League administration ended following a student uprising on August 5, 2024, forcing her to seek refuge in India.

And now that McGregor has declared his intentions to be a bare-knuckle fighting champion, White has seemingly okayed McGregor’s possible return to the ring once again.McGregor who’s also known as The Notorious One made waves recently when he shared his intentions of stepping into the BKFC ring. ""If you think I'm here giving these speeches and leading these men into battle and that I'm not going to step in myself, think again. Without a doubt. Conor McGregor will fight in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, mark my words.

So, fans were naturally curious to find out whether he would return to the UFC ring before his BKFC conquests.David Feldman, president of BKFC, reportedly met with White to get his approval to feature McGregor in the BKFC fight. There is something at stake. I think the UFC will probably be willing to collaborate in that regard because they collaborate with Bare Knuckle. And Conor is an owner, a minority owner, so there might be something there if that gets Conor back in the ring,"" UFC star Brendan Schaub, in his podcast, The Schaub Show.McGregor also known as ‘Notorious’, has been a staple in the UFC for over a decade and chances are, his much-anticipated stint in bare-knuckle boxing will up his value, and lead his UFC investors to a profit in the near future.There’s quite a bit of speculation surrounding his BKFC debut and fans are now anticipating the possibility of seeing McGregor face off against Eddie Alvarez or a rematch with rival Nate Diaz in the bare-knuckle arena.","Conor McGregor has declared his intentions to be a bare-knuckle fighting champion.

Cain LLC argued that the incident was not se*ual assault but locker room horseplay.""Have we forgotten about horseplay? Have we forgotten about what people do in locker rooms in competitive sports — team sports? I submit to you that we have, and that's how this case came about,"" Mestemaker said during Monday's news conference.He added, ""We look forward to trying the case and exonerating our client who has a bright future in the NBA, once he is acquitted of these charges.

The charges are part of a larger scandal that created a shockwave in the university’s athletic program.A New Mexico Department of Justice report revealed that NMSU created a ""toxic locker room culture,"" where serious assault claims were ignored. The report showed multiple failures by the university to address allegations of misconduct within the basketball team.The controversy came to light following reports of Washington, along with two other players, is accused of subjecting teammates to a so-called ""humbling"" ritual. This process allegedly involved forcing players to exercise while exposing their private parts or tackling them to squeeze their genitalia. These disturbing actions are at the center of the hazing allegations that have shocked the NMSU basketball program.Mestemaker has downplayed the incident calling it ""a bunch of teenage boys playing around, doing stupid stuff, no harm intended."" He further stated that the victims were “participants” of the harrowing ritual. “They did their own shenanigans in the locker room, which there are videotapes,"" he added.Mestemaker also defended the NMSU sharing that the institution has been closely investigating the incident, ""The sensitivity stops pretty much-- in my opinion-- at the locker room door.

The state has had at least 17 GBS-linked deaths in the last few weeks.The Pune patient died on Saturday at Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) while the Nagpur boy passed away at the city's Government Medical College and Hospital on Feb 10. In Pune, nine people have died since a GBS outbreak broke on Jan 5.Doctors said the Wagholi resident was brought to SGH from a private hospital. ""He was referred to us on Feb 3, around 5pm,"" said dean of SGH, Dr Eknath Pawar.A senior SGH official said the patient had loose motions for three days, starting on Jan 23. The official said: ""Days later, he began experiencing a tingling in the limbs and loss of power in both legs, which progressed to the upper limbs within six hours. This loss of power in all limbs progressed rapidly over the next three days and by Feb 8, he had lost strength in the neck, respiratory and facial muscles. He had trouble swallowing too.""The hospital official added the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation, given the paralysis in respiratory and neck muscles. ""His condition kept deteriorating. He also developed severe autonomic imbalance. We administered five doses of intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive antibiotics. The first IVIG dose was given 24 hours after admission. Unfortunately, we couldn't save him. He never regained muscle power in his legs, arms, chest or face,"" the official said.Dr Pawar confirmed the death occurred on Saturday, Feb 15. A total of 20 GBS patients are on ventilator support in Pune.In Nagpur, the 8-year-old boy, was admitted on Jan 16 and he succumbed on Feb 10. At the time of death, his GBS diagnosis was not confirmed. At GMCH, several patients are still battling GBS. Among them is a seven-year-old girl who is on mechanical ventilation and continues to be in a critical condition.Union junior minister for AYUSH, Prataprao Jadhav, Monday hinted at the possibility of travel restrictions in affected areas if the disease is found to be contagious. ""If the disease is spreading from one region to another, imposing travel restrictions may become necessary. Discussions between the central and state health departments are ongoing to address the situation,"" Jadhav told reporters in Buldhana.But advisories from WHO and US CDC have said that GBS is not contagious or hereditary. Often, a GBS cluster is linked to another outbreak. In Pune for example, GBS began to show up in clusters after mass Campylobacter infections. It's an autoimmune condition that's triggered when the body's immune system attacks nerves that carry brain signals to parts of the body.On Jan 25, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said there was no need to panic as GBS was not a communicable disease.""The state govt has reviewed the situation. Health minister Prakash Abitkar, health secretary and I met to discuss GBS cases. I have told the civil surgeon, Pune district collector, and other officials to keep a close watch on the situation.

Where is it going? And nobody, I’ve never seen an accounting of it. We give hundreds of billions of dollars. I don’t see any accounting.

The White House on Tuesday shared a video titled "" ASMR : Illegal Alien Deportation Flight"" showing immigrants in shackles boarding a deportation flight. According to CNBC News, the flight departed from Seattle.The post shared on X features various clips of officers preparing restraints, chaining deportees, detainees walking in chains, and individuals boarding a plane.The White House’s use of the term ASMR in this context drew reactions online, including from billionaire Elon Musk , who responded with: “Haha wow.”The 40-second video includes close-up shots of handcuffs being laid out, officers securing restraints, and detainees walking up steel steps to the aircraft. None of the individuals’ faces are visible. The video was originally posted by the Seattle office of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with the caption: ""REMOVAL FLIGHT. A group of undocumented aliens are flown from Seattle as part of a process to finalize return to their home countries,"" CNBC reports.Other X users also reacted to the video, with one calling its posting on the White House's official account ""based."" Another questioned, ""How much did this security theatre cost the American taxpayer?"" A third user expressed surprise, saying, ""I never thought I would hear an ASMR video of deportation.""ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is a relaxing, tingling sensation that some people experience in response to specific sounds or visual triggers. Common ASMR triggers include soft whispering, tapping, crinkling paper, brushing sounds, and even gentle hand movements. Many people watch ASMR videos to help with relaxation, sleep, or stress relief. The sensation can create a calming effect similar to a light massage or a soothing lullaby.The White House's decision to label its deportation video as ASMR suggests that, for some, the sights and sounds of shackles and chains might evoke a similar reaction.Since taking office on January 20, President Donald Trump has increased deportations as part of his immigration policy. Thousands of undocumented immigrants have already been sent back, including over 300 Indian nationals.Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, has said the administration will continue deportations, stating that he will not rest until every “illegal criminal migrant” is “eradicated” from the country. He also noted that illegal crossings have decreased under Trump compared to the previous administration.","The White House on Tuesday shared a video titled "" ASMR : Illegal Alien Deportation Flight"" The 40-second video includes close-up shots of handcuffs being laid out, officers securing restraints, and detainees walking up steel steps to the aircraft.

She described his routine as, “He goes to class, he goes home,” and recalled a professor joking that Barron “doesn’t really belong here.”Her comments stirred a row, with the national College Republicans of America (CRA) criticising them as “inappropriate” and not reflective of the organisation’s values.In the wake of the controversy, CRA President Will Donahue invited Barron to join their ranks, saying, “Barron Trump represents the future of the conservative movement, and we would be honoured to have him join College Republicans of America.” He added, “Strong leadership is built on resilience, courage, and the humility to rise above petty hostility—qualities that Barron has already demonstrated.”Barron’s presence at NYU has drawn attention since he enrolled at the Stern School of Business last autumn. Despite being the son of a US president, he has remained mostly private, largely due to the Secret Service officers who accompany him.His commute from Trump Tower to campus in black SUVs has sparked curiosity, but he is rarely seen outside class. Unlike past celebrity students like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen or Dylan Sprouse, Barron keeps a low profile.Some students have tried to interact with him. One recalled asking him to play basketball, saying Barron seemed interested but suggested he “wasn’t really allowed to do stuff.” Meanwhile, his movements have occasionally been shared online, with one student posting a picture of him in class and writing, “Today was wild.”According to reports, the 6'7"" Barron has been described as a “ladies’ man” by many, while others say he prefers video games and quiet hobbies. His brother, Eric Trump, once called him “the most eligible bachelor in the world.” Conservative commentators like Benny Johnson have referred to the study on him as “what real rizz is.”Walker’s resignation has put more focus on Barron’s role in conservative circles. He has not made a public statement or joined social media, but some view him as an emerging figure in the movement. With CRA backing Donald Trump before the Republican primaries and now inviting Barron, the group seems eager to bring him in.","Kaya Walker stepped down after calling Barron “sort of like an oddity on campus” Her comments stirred a row, with the national College Republicans of America criticising them as “inappropriate” and not reflective of the organisation’s values.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118371308,imgsize-1545320,width-400,resizemode-4/118371308.jpg"

Mass layoffs and buyout scheme

A federal judge rejected an emergency request on Tuesday to stop billionaire Elon Musk and his department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from firing federal employees and accessing agency data.This move bolstered US President Donald Trump’s plan to cut government spending, as he called for large-scale reductions across several departments and agencies. Thousands have already lost their jobs, while many more await dismissal.Fourteen Democrat-led states sued last week, challenging Musk’s authority. But on Tuesday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled they had not proven immediate or irreversible harm, saying this was not enough to justify blocking his actions.""Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order,"" Chutkan said.Chutkan is an appointee of former US President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the now-abandoned criminal case against Trump for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.DOGE is an independent agency led by Musk and aims to reduce government spending by cutting jobs and eliminating agencies. While Trump has maintained that agency heads are making the layoffs , critics argue that Musk wields too much power over federal operations.The 14 states claimed in their lawsuit that Musk had not been officially nominated or confirmed for a government position, yet was making key decisions on government contracts, expenditures, and staffing. They also raised concerns about DOGE gaining access to sensitive data from departments including education, labour, health and human services, energy, and transportation.Despite these concerns, Chutkan dismissed the request for a temporary restraining order. She said that uncertainty over DOGE’s actions was not enough to justify immediate court intervention. “The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents. But the ‘possibility’ that Defendants may take actions that irreparably harm Plaintiffs ‘is not enough,’” she ruled.Musk’s cost-cutting measures have already led to major disruptions, with thousands of federal employees sent home as agencies face closures. A separate legal challenge sought to block a mass buyout scheme that offered federal employees eight months’ pay if they voluntarily resigned. In an email titled ""Fork in the Road,"" more than two million government workers were warned they could either accept the buyout or risk being fired in future layoffs.The White House said over 75,000 employees have already taken the offer, but unions representing government workers have fought to block the initiative. Last week, another federal judge lifted a temporary freeze on the buyout plan, allowing it to continue.Trump’s sweeping government overhaul has faced multiple court battles, with the White House accusing “judges in liberal districts” of attempting to block the administration’s reforms. However, rulings on these cases have come from judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump himself.","US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected an emergency request on Tuesday to stop billionaire Elon Musk and his department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from firing federal employees.

They face several charges, including trespassing, obstructing and hindering, and possession of a handgun in their vehicle.The pair are scheduled for a bail hearing at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court , CBS News reported.The Zizians have been connected to six homicides, including the death of US Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January, with additional killings in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.Maland, 44, lost his life in a January 20 shootout after initiating a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, situated approximately 20 miles from the Canadian border.The Border Patrol incident's criminal complaint states that 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut was operating a vehicle with a German passenger when gunfire erupted shortly after they were stopped.The German national, Felix Baukholt, was found to have an expired visa in a Department of Homeland Security database.Court records indicate that Youngblut allegedly fired a handgun without warning at a minimum of one Border Patrol agent from the driver's position. The exchange resulted in injuries to Maland, Youngblut and Baukholt. According to CBS News Minnesota, Baukholt died at the scene, while Maland succumbed to his injuries at hospital.The firearm used in Vermont has been linked to the December 31, 2022, deaths of Richard and Rita Zajko in Pennsylvania. US Attorney Michael Drescher's court filing states that both Youngblut and the weapon purchaser maintained frequent contact with a person of interest in the Pennsylvania investigation, who is also connected to a California homicide.Investigators have released limited information about this cross-country case, which gained momentum after Maland's January 20 death.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability.

Pakistan says at least 16 nationals died in migrant boat sinking near Libya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-says-at-least-16-nationals-died-in-migrant-boat-sinking-near-libya/articleshow/118152842.cms,"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief after a boat carrying Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya’s coast

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.
