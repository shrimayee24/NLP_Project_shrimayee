A precise response, not a war cry



The Pahalgam attack and its intent



A united Indian voice to the world



NEW DELHI: In a strong and clear message to global community, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday explained how India gave a firm but measured response after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack . Speaking at Indian Consulate in New York, Tharoor said India chose to ""hit hard and hit smart"", targeting only specific terrorist camps in Pakistan, without escalating the situation into a larger conflict.India launched its counterterror strikes on May 7 in Pakistan and PoK under Operation Sindoor , as a strong response to Pahalgam massacre.Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation visiting several countries in Americas to highlight India’s united stand against terrorism. Their first stop in New York was the 9/11 Memorial.Tharoor said it was an emotional moment, especially in light of the recent attack in Pahalgam.“It was obviously a very moving moment for us,” he said, “but it was also meant to send a strong message. We are here in a city which is bearing still the scars of that savage terrorist attack in the wake of yet another terrorist attack in our own country.”He added that the visit is about standing in solidarity and reminding the world that terrorism is a global threat that must be faced together.“We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims... It’s a global problem, it’s a scourge and we must all fight it unitedly.”Though he is part of the Opposition, Tharoor supported the central government’s swift action after the Pahalgam attack.“I don’t work for the government, as you know. I work for an opposition party, but I myself authored an op-ed in one of India’s leading papers, within a couple of days saying that the time had come to hit hard and hit smart and I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.”He explained that India struck nine known terror bases, including Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s base in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad’s headquarters in Bahawalpur. These groups have long been linked to attacks on India and other countries.“India sent a clear message that it was not going to take terror lying down... by delivering very precisely, calculated, calibrated strikes... this was not meant to be the opening salvo in a protracted war but just an act of retribution.”Tharoor described the Pahalgam attack as a brutal and deliberate attempt to create communal tension in India.“It was a bunch of people going around identifying the religions of the people before them and killing them on that basis, which was clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, since the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu.”But he praised the people of Jammu and Kashmir, from political leaders to ordinary citizens, for standing together in unity.“There was an extraordinary amount of togetherness cutting across religious and other divides that people have tried to provoke. The message is very clear that there was a malign intent... India, sadly, had no reason to doubt where it came from.”Tharoor also mentioned that a terror group called The Resistance Front (TRF), known to be linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, quickly claimed responsibility for the killings. Despite India presenting evidence to the United Nations in previous years, the group was still not officially condemned in recent UN statements - largely due to opposition from Pakistan and China.He said, "" Within one hour of the atrocity, a group called the Resistance Front had claimed credit. The Resistance Front was known for some years to be a frontal organisation of the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is on the US-designated terror list as well as UN sanctions committees. India had gone to the UN sanctions committee with information about the Resistance Front in 2023 and 2024, and now sadly, it acted in 2025. ..Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial.""""Sadly Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial, in fact, Pakistan with the help of China succeeded in removing the reference to TRF from the press statement drafted in the Security Council of the UN two days later.”The all-party delegation includes MPs from different political backgrounds -- BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, TDP, JMM, and LJP - along with former Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Their mission is to meet government officials, lawmakers, think tanks, media, and the public across countries.“Our idea is very much to speak to a cross section of public and political opinion... to enlarge your understanding of our thinking and our concern about what’s going on.”“We will be in every country, meeting members of the executive, meeting members of the legislature, meeting big tankers and influential foreign policy experts, and at the same time interacting with the media and public opinion.”In his interaction at the Consulate, Thiruvananthapuram MP said and referred to PM Modi's ""new normal"" resolve, ""We are determined now that there's got to be a new bottom line to this. We have tried everything, international dossier, complaints...everything has been tried. Pakistan has remained in denial, there has been absolutely no conviction, no serious criminal prosecution, no attempt to dismantle the terror infrastructure in that country, and the persistence of safe havens. ..you (Pakistan) do this, you are going to get this back and we have demonstrated with this Operation (Operation Sindoor) that we can do it with a degree of precision.""",India launched its counterterror strikes on May 7 in Pakistan and PoK under Operation Sindoor.

The United States Army has revealed that an army helicopter which lost contact with military air traffic controllers near the Pentagon earlier this month, was off-radar for about 20 seconds.As a result, two commercial jets, which were about to land at Washington's Ronald Reagan airport, were forced to abort the landings.The incident occurred on May 1.""The handlers lost contact with the Black Hawk because a temporary control tower antenna was not set up in a location where it would be able to maintain contact with the helicopter as it flew low and rounded the Pentagon to land. The antenna was set up during construction of a new control tower and has now been moved to the roof of the Pentagon,"" Brigadier General Matthew Braman, the head of Army aviation, told news agency AP.""Federal air traffic controllers inside the Washington airport also didn’t have a good fix on the location of the helicopter. The Black Hawk was transmitting data that should have given them its precise location. FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) officials told me in last week that the data the controllers were getting from multiple feeds and sensors was inconclusive,"" Braman added.In the initial reporting on the aborted landings, an FAA official suggested the Black Hawk was on a “scenic route.”However, the US Army's data shows the crew hewed closely to its approved flight path, directly up the I-395 highway corridor, also called ""Route 5."" The chopper then rounded the Pentagon, home to the US Department of Defense, in Washington DC.FAA air traffic controllers at the Ronald Reagan airport subsequently aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 and a Republic Airways Embraer E170.The aborted landings adde to general unease about continued close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport following a deadly mid-air collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter, which killed 67 people.In March, the aviation authority permanently restricted choppers from flying on the route where the collision occurred.

NEW DELHI: A 45-year-old businessman from Himachal Pradesh was allegedly duped and extorted of nearly Rs 2 lakh after being lured to Delhi by a woman he had befriended online five months ago.On May 18, the woman invited him to Najafgarh Metro Station under the pretext of discussing a business proposal. Unaware of the trap ahead, the businessman agreed to meet her.Once there, he was taken to a nearby house by the woman and her friend, where two men—posing as police officers—barged into the house and accused him of illegal activity, threatening jail time unless he paid up. Delhi Police has since apprehended the two men.The complainant, a resident of Kangra in Himachal Pradesh, told police: “Around four to five months ago, I befriended a girl through social media. We started chatting on WhatsApp. On May 18, she asked me to meet her at gate number 1 of Najafgarh Metro Station, saying it was related to her business. Around 12.15 pm, I met her at the metro station. She was accompanied by another girl. They both suggested we go to their house to talk.The group then took an erickshaw to Najafgarh Phase-2 and went to a double-storey house with two rooms. While they were speaking inside, two men suddenly entered—one dressed in a police uniform with two stars while the other in a safari suit, he said.“They began threatening us, claiming we were involved in immoral activities, and said they would take us to the police station. They intimidated me, saying if I paid Rs 2.1 lakh, they would let me go; otherwise, they would send me to jail,” the complainant added.The complainant said that he got frightened and agreed to pay. As he didn’t have the full amount, he sent a QR code provided by the blackmailers to his friend via WhatsApp, asking him to transfer Rs 1 lakh. His friend grew suspicious and alerted the police.“Police began calling me, which caused the blackmailers to panic. They rushed me into a car and took me to an ATM on Nangloi Road.

The accused then took his phone and transferred Rs 1,24,000 via UPI to their own account. Then they dropped him on the roadside and warned him not to report the incident.Police said they are part of a gang involved in similar extortion cases and search is on for other suspects.","A 45-year-old businessman from Himachal Pradesh was allegedly duped and extorted of nearly Rs 2 lakh.

'Crazy feelings'



Diplomatic push







KYIV: Russian strikes killed three people in the Kyiv region overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, as the two countries fired drones towards each other's capitals.AFP journalists heard explosions in the Ukrainian capital, with the head of the city's military administration warning ""the night will not be easy"".Russian authorities meanwhile, reported that a dozen drones flying towards Moscow had been downed.The latest fire comes as the two sides pursue their biggest prisoner swap since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In Kyiv region ""three people died last night as a result of an enemy attack,"" said Mykola Kalashnyk, who heads the regional military administration.The city's mayor earlier said Russia's attack wounded at least 10 people, while he warned residents to stay in shelters.The capital was ""under attack"" but ""air defences are operating"", said Mayor Vitali Klitschko.Tymur Tkachenko, Kyiv city's military administration chief, reported ""more than a dozen enemy drones"" were in airspace around the capital.""Some of the drones over Kyiv and the surrounding area have already been dealt with. But the new ones are still entering the capital,"" he wrote on Telegram.Debris fell on a five-storey residential building, he added.Overnight attacks were also reported in the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions.In Moscow, restrictions were imposed on at least four airports, including the main hub Sheremetyevo, the Russian civilian aviation authority said.Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said 12 drones flying towards the Russian capital had been intercepted.The renewed attacks follow Ukraine's air force on Saturday morning saying Russia had launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones overnight.Officials said 15 people were wounded in those strikes.The Russian military said Saturday that Ukraine had targeted it with 788 drones and missiles since Tuesday.Dozens of drones targeting Moscow have been shot down over the past week.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's attacks indicated Moscow was ""prolonging the war"" and repeated his call for ramped-up sanctions.But he also said he expected officials to press on with a prisoner swap agreed during talks last week in Istanbul.On Saturday, 307 Russian prisoners of war were exchanged for the same number of Ukrainian soldiers, according to announcements in Kyiv and Moscow.Both sides received 390 people in the first stage on Friday and are expected to exchange 1,000 each in total.Russia has signalled it will send Ukraine its terms for a peace settlement after the exchange, without saying what those terms would be.The two enemies have held regular prisoner swaps, but none has been on this scale.An AFP reporter saw some of the formerly captive Ukrainian soldiers arrive at a hospital in the northern Chernigiv region, emaciated but smiling and waving to crowds waiting outside.After they stepped off the bus, tearful relatives rushed to embrace the soldiers while others held pictures of their loved ones, hoping to find out if they had been seen in captivity.Many of the soldiers were draped in bright yellow and blue Ukrainian flags.""It's simply crazy. Crazy feelings,"" 31-year-old Konstantin Steblev, a soldier, told AFP after he was released following three years in captivity.US President Donald Trump earlier congratulated the two countries for the swap.""This could lead to something big???"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire in Europe's biggest conflict since World War II have so far been unsuccessful, despite his pledge to rapidly end the fighting.One of the soldiers formerly held captive, 58-year-old Viktor Syvak, told AFP it was hard to express his emotional homecoming.Captured in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, he had been held for 37 months and 12 days.""I didn't expect such a welcome. It's impossible to describe. I can't put it into words. It's very joyful,"" he said.A fter more than three years of fighting, thousands of POWs are held in both countries.Russia is believed to have the larger share, with the number of Ukrainian captives held by Moscow estimated to be between 8,000 and 10,000.Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stepped up in recent weeks, but the Kremlin has shown no sign it has walked back its maximalist demands for ending the fighting.Russian President Vladimir Putin has defied European pressure for a full and unconditional truce in Ukraine, pressing on with its offensive, which has left tens of thousands dead.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's attacks indicated Moscow was ""prolonging the war"" But he also said he expected officials to press on with a prisoner swap agreed during talks last week in Istanbul. 307 Russian prisoners of war were exchanged for the same number of Ukrainian soldiers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121389157,imgsize-1306718,width-400,resizemode-4/121389157.jpg"

Keep the memory going







M INNEAPOLIS: Americans on Sunday mark five years since George Floyd was killed by a US police officer, as President Donald Trump backtracks on reforms designed to tackle racism.Floyd's deadly arrest on May 25, 2020 helped launch the black lives matter movement into a powerful force that sought to resolve America's deeply rooted racial issues, from police violence to systemic inequality.But since Trump's return to power in January he was serving his first term when Floyd died his administration has axed civil rights investigations and cracked down on diversity hiring initiatives.BLM, meanwhile, finds itself lacking the support it enjoyed when protesters sprawled across US cities during the Covid pandemic with many now agreeing the movement achieved little of substance.An anniversary event is taking place in what has been named George Floyd Square, the area of Minneapolis where the 46-year-old took his final breath as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck during an arrest.A small junction in a residential part of the northern US city, the square is covered with protest art including a purple mural that reads ""you changed the world, George.""That optimistic message painted in 2020 is now, however, at odds with a president whose more extreme allies have suggested he pardon Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering Floyd and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.Some experts believe Trump's re-election was partly a backlash to BLM activism, which included protests that turned to riots in some cities and calls to defund the police.Floyd's family members told AFP in Minneapolis on Friday that they wanted people to continue pushing for reform despite the hostile political climate.""We don't need an executive order to tell us that Black lives matter,"" said his aunt Angela Harrelson, who wore a dark T-shirt depicting Floyd's face.""We cannot let a setback be a holdback for the great comeback. Donald Trump just didn't get the memo,"" she added to nods from other relatives standing beside her.Paris Stevens, a Floyd cousin, agreed: ""No one can silence us anymore.""The Floyd relatives, with around 50 other people, held a moment of silence on Friday afternoon before placing yellow roses on the roadside spot where Floyd's fatal arrest was filmed and shared around the world.It was a moment of reflection others include a candlelight vigil on Sunday night during a weekend otherwise devoted to music, arts and dancing.Memorial events have been held annually since Floyd's death and the theme for this one ""The People Have Spoken"" was suggested by Nelson Mandela's grandson Nkosi when he visited the square, according to Harrelson.She said the defiant title was meant to reflect five years of protesting, adding that ""even though it's tiresome, we go on.""Visitors are expected to pay their respects through the weekend.Jill Foster, a physician from Minneapolis, told AFP at the square on Friday that she felt honoring Floyd's legacy was partly a form of political resistance.""Under the Trump administration, everything is trying to be rewritten and a new reality created,"" the 66-year-old said.""We have to keep the memory going and keep the information flowing.""Meanwhile, for Courteney Ross, Floyd's girlfriend when he died, the anniversary weekend brings up powerful feelings of personal loss.""I miss him so much, I miss him by my side,"" Ross, 49, told AFP, dressed in black and holding a bunch of yellow roses.""It's beautiful to see all the people come out and celebrate him,"" she added.""You see a unification that you don't get a lot in this country lately, and people are celebrating a man who, you know, gave his life for us.""","Americans on Sunday mark five years since George Floyd was killed by a US police officer.

A Dalton police officer has stepped down from his position after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented student, which resulted in her ICE detention, as confirmed by a city spokesperson to CBS News on Saturday.Bruce Frazier, speaking for the City of Dalton, provided no additional details about the officer's departure or the reasons behind it, declining to identify the officer by name.The officer's departure follows an incident on May 5 when he mistakenly pulled over Ximena Arias Cristobal for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton from where ICE officials took her into custody.A review of the dashboard camera recordings revealed that a different vehicle, similar to Arias Cristobal's truck, had made the improper turn. Consequently, authorities dropped the traffic charges against her on May 12.The recorded conversation between the officer and Arias Cristobal included:""You ever been to jail?,"" the officer can heard asking Arias Cristobal in the dashcam footage.""No, sir,"" she responded.""Well, you're going,"" the officer said.""I cannot go to jail.

An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week. According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.So far, there have been no confirmed reports of injuries or structural damage, though assessments are still underway.The region experienced four previous earthquakes between May 16 and May 20. On Monday, May 19, a 4.2 magnitude quake was recorded. A day earlier, on May 18, a slightly stronger 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 150 kms. Prior to that, quakes of magnitudes 4.2 and 4.0 were reported on May 17 and 16, respectively.The recent spike in seismic activity has raised concerns among experts and residents alike. Afghanistan, particularly the Hindu Kush region, is recognised as a seismically active zone due to its location along the collision boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. A major fault line also runs through the western province of Herat, further amplifying the region’s vulnerability.The International Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) have frequently highlighted Afghanistan’s susceptibility to natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal flooding.More information is awaited as monitoring agencies continue to assess the impact.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week.

FBI director Kash Patel announces a major crackdown on an immigration scam that was going on for years by two Pakistani men based out of Texas who placed classified ads for fake jobs to orchestrate the scam. Abdul Hadi Murshid, 39, and Muhammad Salman Nasir, 35, a law firm and a business entity, have been indicted for this visa fraud scheme. The law firm and the business entity are the law officers of D Robert Jones PLLC and Reliable Ventures, Inc.""Major arrests out of @FBIDallas. Abdul Hadi Murshid and Muhammad Salman Nasir — two individuals out of Texas who allegedly oversaw and operated a criminal enterprise circumventing American immigration laws by selling fraudulent visa applications. Well done to our FBI teams and partners in the investigation,"" Kash Patel posted.The indictment says that they exploited the EB-2, EB-3, and H-1B visa programs by placing classified ads for fake jobs to satisfy Department of Labor requirements. There were no jobs but the ads helped them get labor certifications. Then they submitted petitions with the USCIS for visas. At the time the petitions were submitted, the defendants also submitted an application for legal permanent residence so that the visa seekers could also obtain a green card.According to the indictment, to make the non-existent jobs look legitimate, the defendants received payment from visa seekers, then returned a portion of the money back to the visa seekers as purported payroll.Though two Pakistani-origin men were the face of the entire fraudulent operations, the FBI called it an international crime as they ran an international criminal enterprise for years. ""The defendants allegedly oversaw an international criminal enterprise for years that repeatedly undermined our nation's immigration laws,"" FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock said in the release. ""These laws are necessary to protect national security and safeguard the lawful immigration process.

What Belgian royal family say about Harvard row







Belgium's future queen Princess Elisabeth is not the only VIP foreign student caught in Donald Trump's legal battle with Harvard. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's daughter Cleo Carney is a first-year student at Harvard. While speculations are rife about whether these VIP international students will have to take admission elsewhere if the Trump administration wins the legal battle, Canada has another issue to worry about. Canada is one of the highest contributors to Harvard's international students after China. And for undergraduate studies, the highest number of international students comes from Canada.Canada has not issued any statement after the Trump administrated barred the university from enrolling foreign students for non-compliance. The administration sought extensive records on nonimmigrant students involved in any crime, violence or illegal activities in the last five years. Harvard did not comply even after the ultimatum and went to the court to get a temporary stay on the order. If Trump wins the legal battle, the existing students will have to transfer to other universities.China, which sends the highest number of students to Harvard, said the ban will tarnish the US's image.“China has consistently opposed the politicization of educational collaboration,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said Friday, adding that the US move “will only tarnish its own image and reputation in the world.”The eldest daughter of Carney and economist Diana Fox Carnet, Cleao Carney, is studying social studies with a minor in energy and the environment. Cleo gained public attention in March 2025 when she introduced her father at the Liberal Party leadership event in Ottawa, where he was announced as Canada’s 24th Prime Minister. Ahead of the election, she advocated for her father as a first-time voter. ""My dad may not be the loudest candidate, but he will always be a principled one. He listens when he could perform. He believes in honesty, not spectacle. That’s what quiet leadership is: work without the ego. And that’s what my dad brings to the table. He’s not running for the spotlight. He’s running so this country can work for all of us,"" she wrote.23-year-old Princess Elisabeth has just finished her first year at Harvard, where she is doing a two-year master's degree in public policy. “The impact of [the Trump administration’s] decision will only become clearer in the coming days/weeks,” Belgian royal palace spokesperson Lore Vandoorne told Reuters. “We are currently investigating the situation.”The palace’s communications director, Xavier Baert, added, “We are analyzing this at the moment and will let things settle.

Biden's two terms as vice president were under Obama (2009-2017).Lovett made the admission on Jon Stewart’s ""The Weekly Show"" podcast, saying he didn't want to publicly voice his concern because he wanted the Democrat to win the US presidential election.""I remember feeling I want to talk about this as a huge liability.

During the 12 months leading up to March, as many as 6,618 US citizens have applied to either become British nationals or to live and work there indefinitely, according to data released by the UK Home Office.This is the highest such number since comparable records began in 2004, the Home Office said.More than 1,900 applications were received between January - when US President Donald Trump began his second term - and March, the data showed.The surge in applications at the start of 2025 made that the highest number for any quarter on record, The Guardian reported The figures come even as British authorities under Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government try to reduce immigration to the United Kingdom. Recently, Starmer vowed to take “back control of our borders” and warned uncontrolled immigration could result in the UK “becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together”.Before Starmer, home secretary Yvette Cooper told British Parliament there would be ""provisions to qualify more swiftly that take account of the contribution people have made.”Cooper further said the British government would ""introduce new, higher language requirements” because “the ability to speak English is integral to everyone’s ability to contribute and integrate”.However, the increase in US applications to the UK may not necessarily reflect political conditions in either country.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal. The move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance"" But critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121319353,imgsize-38182,width-400,resizemode-4/121319353.jpg"
Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.
