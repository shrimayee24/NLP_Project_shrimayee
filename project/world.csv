Security Plans: Modi 3.0: G20-like security plans in place for swearing-in ceremony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/modi-30-g20-like-security-plans-in-place-for-swearing-in-ceremony/articleshow/110777990.cms,"NEW DELHI: A security apparatus exactly like the G20 summit will be in place for the swearing-in ceremony likely to be held on June 9 , sources said on Thursday. A ground-to-air surveillance is being set up in coordination with the intelligence agencies and the armed forces to secure central Delhi. From using advance intrusion alert systems and posture detection mechanism to covert snipers — security forces are learnt to be using every resource possible to tackle what they said was another security nightmare.South Asian heads of govt have been invited to the oath ceremony and Bangladesh and Sri Lankan leaders have already confirmed their presence. There are three primary challenges for Delhi Police — security of hotels where heads of state and dignitaries will be staying being the prime concern. Four hotels — Taj, Maurya, Leela and Oberoi — are being brought under heavy security cover.Two other key security issues are the movement of their carcade and the security of the route between the hotel and the venue. Each dignitary will be given a call sign that will be disclosed on the morning of ceremony. This will be used for coordinating the movement of the carcade and their route to the Rashtrapati Bhawan and Kartavya Path.An elaborate brainstorming session was held at the Delhi Police headquarters on Thursday afternoon to discuss the nitty-gritty of the arrangements. According to a DCP-rank officer privy to the discussions, a decision to replicate the measures adopted during G20 was taken during the meeting. “This means that there will be venue commanders of DCP rank at each hotel where the foreign heads of state will stay. They will report to the zonal/vertical commanders of special commissioner ranks,” said the officer.While the intelligence sleuths are coordinating with their foreign counterparts — who will form the immediate security cordon of their respective dignitary — Delhi Police is working on the inputs conveyed to it in making the venues and routes foolproof. The threat perception of each foreign leader is being studied individually.The intrusion alert system and the posture detection will help cops filter out suspicious movements. “The advance AI-based cameras and software will raise alarm and alert security if a man or a woman is caught scaling the wall or shows unusual bodily movement like crawling or limp walking with a bent back,” explained an officer.The vetting and background check of hotel staffers is being undertaken by special branch and security unit and the verification reports prepared during G20 is also being studied again. There would be separate set of staffers for each floor and their movement will be contained to that floor of the hotel itself at all times.The cops and security personnel will have at least two rooms to themselves which will function as control rooms. While state borders will remain sealed during the ceremony, there will be extra vigil at malls, markets, monuments and places of worship by quick response teams, commando units, and strike forces with special vehicles.","South Asian heads of govt have been invited to the oath ceremony.

North Korea flies trash-carrying balloons to South Korea in another retaliation against leafletting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-flies-trash-carrying-balloons-to-south-korea-in-another-retaliation-against-leafletting/articleshow/110830799.cms,"SEOUL: North Korea flew hundreds of trash-carrying balloons to South Korea again in its third such campaign since late May, the South's military said, just days after South Korean activists floated their own balloons to scatter propaganda leaflets in the North.North Korea has so far sent more than 1,000 balloons to drop tons of trash and manure in the South in retaliation against South Korean civilian leafletting campaigns, adding to tensions between the war-divided rivals amid a diplomatic stalemate over the North's nuclear ambitions.In response, South Korea suspended a 2018 tension-easing agreement with North Korea. The move allows the South to restart live-fire military exercises and anti-North Korean propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts in border areas, actions that are certain to anger North Korea and prompt it to take its own retaliatory military steps.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North launching around 330 balloons toward the South since Saturday night and about 80 were found in South Korean territory as of Sunday morning. The military said winds were blowing eastward on Saturday night, which possibly caused many balloons to float away from South Korean territory.The South's military said the balloons that did land dropped trash, including plastic and paper waste, but no hazardous substances were discovered.The military, which has mobilized chemical rapid response and explosive clearance units to retrieve the North Korean balloons and materials, alerted the public to beware of falling objects and not to touch balloons found on the ground but report them to police or military authorities.Saturday's balloon launches by North Korea were the third of their kind since May 28. In North Korea's previous two rounds of balloon activities, South Korean authorities discovered about 1,000 balloons that were tied to vinyl bags containing manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste batteries and waste papers. Some were popped and scattered on roads, residential areas and schools. No highly dangerous materials were found and no major damage has been reported.The North's vice defense minister, Kim Kang Il, later said his country would stop the balloon campaign but threatened to resume it if South Korean activists sent leaflets again.In defiance of the warning, a South Korean civilian group led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it launched 10 balloons from a border town on Thursday carrying 200,000 anti-North Korean leaflets, USB sticks with K-pop songs and South Korean dramas, and $1 U.S. bills. South Korean media reported another activist group also flew balloons with 200,000 propaganda leaflets toward North Korea on Friday.South Korean officials called the North Korean trash balloon launches and other recent provocations as ""absurd, irrational"" and vowed strong retaliation.North Korea is extremely sensitive to South Korean civilian leafletting campaigns and front-line propaganda broadcasts as it forbids access to foreign news for most of its 26 million people. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a third generation of his family to rule North Korea with an iron fist since 1948.Experts say North Korea's balloon campaign is also meant to cause a divide in South Korea over its conservative government's tough approach on North Korea.Liberal lawmakers, some civic groups and front-line residents in South Korea have called on the government to urge leafleting activists to stop flying balloons to avoid unnecessary clashes with North Korea. But government officials haven't made such an appeal in line with last year's constitutional court ruling that struck down a law criminalizing an anti-North Korea leafletting as a violation of free speech.","North Korea has so far sent more than 1,000 balloons to drop tons of trash and manure in the South. South Korea suspended a 2018 tension-easing agreement with North Korea. The move allows the South to restart live-fire military exercises and anti-North Korean propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110830839,imgsize-1655606,width-400,resizemode-4/110830839.jpg"
Haiti's new prime minister hospitalized days after being selected to lead country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/haitis-new-prime-minister-hospitalized-days-after-being-selected-to-lead-country/articleshow/110830695.cms,"PORT-AU-PRINCE: Haiti's newly selected prime minister, Garry Conille , was hospitalized late Saturday in the capital of Port-au-Prince just days after arriving in the country, the government said.It wasn't immediately known why Conille was hospitalized.The office of the prime minister said in a statement that Conille was feeling slightly unwell ""following a week of intense activities."" It did not provide further details except to say that Conille was stable and that he thanked those who visited him and wished him well.Louis Gerald Gilles, a member of the transitional presidential council that recently chose Conille as leader of the troubled Caribbean country, told The Associated Press that he was at the hospital but unable to provide further information.A person close to Conille, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told AP that he was with the prime minister when he noticed Conille appeared to have trouble breathing. The person said he called high-ranking officials and told them Conille needed to be taken to the hospital.A spokesman for Conille did not return messages for comment.AP journalists observed high-ranking officials entering the hospital, including Frantz Elbe, director of Haiti's National Police. Also present was Bruno Maes, Unicef's representative in Haiti.A handful of curious onlookers gathered outside the hospital as authorities blocked the street with tinted-glass SUVs.Conille was chosen as prime minister May 28 after a convoluted selection process. He faces an arduous task as Haiti's newest leader, including quelling widespread gang violence as the country prepares for the U.N.-backed deployment of a Kenyan police force, a move that was delayed in part because Haiti lacked a premier after former Prime Minister Ariel Henry stepped down April 25.Henry was on an official visit to Kenya when gangs launched coordinated attacks Feb. 29, burning police stations, shooting at the country's main international airport and storming Haiti's two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. The violence left Henry locked out of the country and eventually led to his resignation.Conille arrived in Haiti on June 1, having worked outside the country until recently as UNICEF's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, a post he assumed in January 2023. He previously served as Haiti's prime minister from October 2011 to May 2012 under then President Michel Martelly.Conille has been meeting with multiple officials and visiting various parts of Port-au-Prince since arriving, including climbing into an armored vehicle wearing a helmet and flak jacket to go along on a patrol with officers from Haiti's National Police.Earlier Saturday, Conille toured Haiti's main international airport, which recently reopened after gang violence forced it to close for nearly three months. On Friday, he met with leaders of the private business sector as well as the country's two telecommunications companies.Conille also had been meeting regularly with the transitional council as they debated who should be appointed to Haiti's new Cabinet.","Garry Conille was feeling slightly unwell ""following a week of intense activities,"" the prime minister's office said.

A second missile fired at the ship missed and people ""on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident,"" Ambrey added, though no one was hurt onboard.The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center similarly reported an attack late Saturday in the same area off Aden, but provided no further details.Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on the Houthis. The rebels did not immediately claim the assault, though it can sometimes take hours or even days for them to acknowledge their attacks.The Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital nearly a decade ago and have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition since shortly after, have been targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. They say the attacks are aimed at stopping the war and supporting the Palestinians, though the attacks often target vessels that have nothing to do with the conflict.The war in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration. A US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.But while gaining more attention internationally, the secretive group has cracked down at dissent at home. Eleven Yemeni employees of United Nations agencies and others working for aid groups have been detained by the Houthis under unclear circumstances, as the rebels face increasing financial pressure and airstrikes from the US-led coalition. The rebels also recently sentenced 44 people to death.","A missile struck an Antigua and Barbuda-flagged cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden on Sunday.

Aid deliveries to Gaza resume through rebuilt pier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/aid-deliveries-to-gaza-resume-through-rebuilt-pier/articleshow/110829893.cms,"Ceasefire 'essential'

'Challenges remain'

Humanitarian aid began trickling back into the devastated Gaza Strip on Saturday via a rebuilt, temporary pier, US forces said.The pier, built by the US military to boost the delivery of direly needed relief supplies, was only briefly operational before it suffered storm damage at the end of May. After repairs, the pipeline was reestablished on Friday.Crews delivered about 492 tonnes (1.1 million pounds) of ""much needed humanitarian assistance"" via the pier on Saturday morning, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) wrote in a social media post.Aid groups and the United Nations have accused Israel of delaying the entry of water, food, medicines and fuel into Gaza, depriving the territory's 2.4 million people of lifesaving supplies.The resumption of the pier comes the same day that Israel mounted an operation in central Gaza to rescue four hostages from a refugee camp where a Hamas-run media office reported the attacks killed 210 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more.CENTCOM stressed that the pier, its personnel and assets were in no way connected to the hostage rescue operation.The Israeli military said the four hostages, who were in ""good medical condition"", had been kidnapped from the Nova music festival during Hamas's October 7 attack that sparked the war, now in its ninth month.Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, had been rescued from two separate buildings ""in the heart of Nuseirat"" camp in a ""complex daytime operation"", the military said.They are among seven captives that Israeli forces have freed alive since Palestinian militants seized 251 people in their October attack on southern Israel.There are now 116 hostages remaining in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.Footage posted on social media showed beachgoers erupting into cheers in Tel Aviv when a lifeguard announced the news.""We have had these hostages in our thoughts for every day for the better part of a year now -- to have even a few of them rescued against all odds, it means the world,"" 42-year-old Israeli Uriya Bekenstein told AFP.In Gaza, the Hamas media office said ""the number of victims from the Israeli occupation's massacre in the Nuseirat camp has risen to 210 martyrs and more than 400 wounded"".Israeli police said an officer was mortally wounded during the rescue operation.It was carried out despite growing international pressure on Israel after a deadly strike on a UN-run school in Nuseirat where displaced Gazans were sheltering.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced regular protests demanding a ceasefire deal to bring the captives home, with demonstrators rallying again on Saturday in Tel Aviv.""Noa (Argamani) is home! We want all of them!"" read one banner at the protest.On Saturday Netanyahu pledged to return the rest of the captives.His office also released a video of him speaking with Argamani on a mobile telephone.She said she was ""very excited"" to return home, adding: ""I haven't spoken Hebrew in such a long time.""US President Joe Biden welcomed the rescue operation, saying: ""We won't stop working until all the hostages are home and a ceasefire is reached. That's essential to happen.""He was speaking in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, who said: ""We rejoice at the release of the four Israeli hostages.""Near Nuseirat on Saturday, an photographer saw scores of Palestinians fleeing the Bureij camp on foot, fearing further Israeli strikes.The operation came days after the Israeli strike on the Nuseirat school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which a Gaza hospital said had killed 37 people and the military said targeted ""terrorists"".UNRWA condemned Israel for striking a facility it said had been housing 6,000 displaced people.Israel accuses Hamas and its allies in Gaza of using civilian infrastructure, including UN-run facilities, as operational centres, charges the militants deny.The war has brought widespread devastation to Gaza, with one in 20 people dead or wounded, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants are displaced.Gaza City resident Yussef al-Dalu said his neighbour's house had been reduced to rubble in an overnight air strike. Emergency services reported five dead.""Only defenceless civilians live in this house who are not part of any resistance (group),"" Dalu told AFP.The Hamas attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,801 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.Israel faces growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognising a Palestinian state.Thousands of people marched through London on Saturday calling for a ceasefire, and demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest against Washington's support for Israel amid Gaza's deadliest-ever war.Facing political pressure, Netanyahu called on war cabinet minister Benny Gantz to ""not leave the emergency government"" after threats last month to quit unless a post-war plan for Gaza was approved by June 8.Gantz had earlier cancelled a news conference scheduled for Saturday where Israeli media had speculated he would announce his resignation.In brief remarks on Israeli television, Gantz on Saturday evening urged his colleagues in government to ""look responsibly"" into ""how we can continue from here"".Efforts to mediate the first ceasefire in the conflict since a week-long pause in November appear to have stalled after Biden offered the latest plan for a multi-phase truce and hostage release.Major sticking points include Hamas insisting on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal from all parts of Gaza -- demands Israel has rejected.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Israel and key regional partners Egypt, Jordan and Qatar from Monday.",U.S. forces deliver 492 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Gaza via a rebuilt pier.

COPENHAGEN: Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Saturday cancelled her appointments after suffering a whiplash injury in a street attack that left her ""shaken"".Frederiksen's office told AFP that she he had been taken to a hospital for a check-up after the attack on Friday evening in a Copenhagen square.The assault has caused a ""minor whiplash injury,"" it said, adding that the prime minister was ""otherwise safe but shaken by the incident"" and her Saturday schedule had been cancelled.French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday became the latest European leader to denounce the attack as ""unacceptable"", in a statement on X.""I strongly condemn this act and wish Mette Frederiksen a speedy recovery,"" Macron added.Danish police on Saturday said ""a 39-year-old man will be brought before the Copenhagen district court for questioning"" to decide if he is to be remanded in custody.The hearing is expected at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT) and would be held in Frederiksberg in Copenhagen, they added.Two witnesses, Marie Adrian and Anna Ravn, told newspaper BT they had seen Frederiksen arrive at the square while they were sitting by a nearby fountain, just before 6:00 pm on Friday.""A man came by in the opposite direction and gave her a hard shove on the shoulder, causing her to fall to the side,"" the two women told the newspaper.They added that while it was a ""strong push"", Frederiksen did not hit the ground.They described the man as tall and slim, and said he had tried to hurry away but had not got far before being grabbed and pushed to the ground by men in suits.The attack was widely condemned by leading European politicians, including EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who said it was a ""despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe.""In 2019, Frederiksen became the country's youngest prime minister, and kept the post after emerging victorious in the 2022 general election.The incident follows a spate of attacks on politicians from across the political spectrum at work or on the campaign trail in Germany ahead of this week's EU elections -- with Danes headed to the polls for their vote on Sunday.On May 15, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting in the central town of Handlova.Fico, who survived the assassination attempt, was taken to a hospital in a nearby city after the shooting, where he underwent two lengthy surgeries.On Saturday, Fico published a photo of him voting in hospital in the European elections and blasted the West for fomenting tensions with Russia.""I voted in hospital"", the 59-year-old said, adding: ""It is necessary to elect European members of parliament who back peace initiatives and not war"".","Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen suffered a whiplash injury in a street attack.

French President Macron hosts Joe Biden as two leaders try to move past trade tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-president-macron-hosts-joe-biden-as-two-leaders-try-to-move-past-trade-tensions/articleshow/110829086.cms,"PARIS: President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit Saturday as the two allies aim to show off their partnership on global security issues and move past trade tensions . Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion.But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defence, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Elysees leading to the Elysee Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements. Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.""Proud to be here,"" Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. ""A great honour.""Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the Covid-19 pandemic receded.Jill Biden flew back to Paris aboard a US government plane after spending Friday in Delaware to support their son, Hunter Biden, who is standing trial on federal gun charges.As the president's trip draws to a close, the far right is likely to emerge as one of the biggest winners in Sunday's European Parliament election while Macron's pro-European Union movement is flagging.A top French official said Macron and Biden have a friendly and warm relationship and stressed that the US president is spending five days in France, reflecting the importance he attaches to the visit. The official spoke anonymously, in line with customary practices for Macron's office.The official said the US presidential campaign was not a factor in the discussion.Macron hosted then-President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee this year, for Bastille Day in 2017, and he came to Washington for a state visit in 2018 before their relationship soured.US and French officials said Ukraine would be at the top of Saturday's agenda, but the centrepiece of the weekend event would be the strength of the alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago, but with roots far deeper.""It's probably a good thing for us to remember that we didn't win our independence either without some foreign help or foreign assistance, specifically from France,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday.Max Bergmann, a former US State Department official who leads Europe research at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the US-French relationship is strong despite occasional disagreements.""There's always tension in Franco-American relations because the French try to do stuff,"" he said. ""They're bold, they throw up proposals, and that leads to some friction when we push back.""For example, he said, France proposed putting Western trainers on the ground in Ukraine, leading to questions of whether this is ""really giving Ukraine a major, tangible benefit"" or has the ""potential to be escalatory and dangerous.""Regarding Macron, Bergmann said, ""he's the one that pushes the boundaries and throws up ideas.""Kirby said the two leaders would have an announcement Saturday on deepening maritime law enforcement cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. They also were to discuss economic and climate challenges.While praising the Biden administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine, Macron said earlier this year that Europe must become ""capable of defending its interests, with its allies by our side whenever they are willing, and alone if necessary,"" arguing the continent should rely less on the US for its own defence.He also warned Western powers against showing any signs of weakness to Russia as he repeatedly said that sending Western troops into Ukraine to shore up its defence should not be ruled out.The leaders were also set to discuss their efforts to bring about a cease-fire to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, as the US and Israel await Hamas' response to a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory.Macron is expected to raise US trade practices that he has often criticised, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favours American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the US, like China, has ""decided not to respect the rules of global trade"" by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe's industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation.The French official said Europe has to defend European interests, after watching the US do the same with its own, but said Macron hopes to find a mutually acceptable outcome.Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said trade with China is a sticking point between the US and Europe, particularly France. The US has been more eager to restrict trade, particularly regarding technology.Biden is also moving toward tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries, which could affect European cars that include Chinese parts.Overall, Hufbauer said, ""Europe wants to maintain much more trade with China than the US wants.""",President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit.

Iran helicopter crash shows Tehran's reliance on an aging fleet as well as its challenges at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-helicopter-crash-shows-tehrans-reliance-on-an-aging-fleet-as-well-as-its-challenges-at-home/articleshow/110813054.cms,"DUBAI, By the time Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi boarded his window seat on a helicopter ferrying him, the foreign minister and six others, thick clouds already had begun forming around the mountaintops along the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Despite the worsening weather, the helicopter lifted off for a trip about 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest to a new oil pipeline near Tabriz.Within an hour, the Bell 212 helicopter had crashed into a cloud-covered mountainside.While the cause of the May 19 crash remains unknown, the sudden death of the hard-line protege of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei exposed the contradictions and challenges facing the country's Shiite theocracy.The Iranian military investigators probing the crash have previously faced international criticism over their report on troops shooting down a Ukrainian airliner in 2020. The hourslong desperate rescue attempt after the helicopter crash saw Tehran even reach out to the United States for help, just weeks after launching an unprecedented attack on Israel and as it enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. Even the type of helicopter that crashed links back to Iranian history, both before and after the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.""Iran is a culture of dualities,"" said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy who studies Iran's military. ""Some aspects, they seem so good and well-managed, well-oiled and very capable. ... In many levels, it's quite lacking.""Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash, largely ruling out possibilities rather than offering a suspected cause. They've rejected the possibility of an onboard ""explosion caused by sabotage"" or a ""cyberattack"" targeting the Bell 212, a two-blade, twin-engine helicopter more widely known as the Huey for its use by the US military in the Vietnam War.""The recorded conversations between the flight crew show that the last contact with the pilots up to the time of the incident and when they stopped responding lasted 69 seconds,"" the investigators said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. ""No emergency declaration was recorded during that time.""In conspiracy-minded Iran, some officials still insist foul play could have caused the crash. However, some other officials have begun to ask why the helicopter took off from the site of the new Giz Galasi Dam when the weather had started to turn.Mostafa Mirsalim, a member of the country's Expediency Council, wrote on the social platform X that he had asked prosecutors to ""address the mistakes that led to the loss of the president and his delegation,"" without elaborating.Abbas Abdi, a prominent journalist, also wrote on X that the flight path taken by Raisi's helicopter suggested the pilot didn't follow a standard Iranian practice of shadowing main roads in rural areas. That can both help navigation and provide a safe landing area in an emergency. Former Iranian Presidents Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abolhassan Banisadr both survived helicopter crashes while in office.The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant in Montreal, Canada, to the Iranian air force, according to data from the firm Cirium. It counts 12 Bell 212 aircraft registered in Iran that are still in service.Bell Textron Inc. , based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it ""does not conduct any business in Iran or support their helicopter fleet, and we do not have knowledge about the active state of the helicopter involved in this accident.""But despite being decades old, the Bell 212 and its military counterpart the Huey still are flown around the world. In the United States, Hueys still fly as part of America's nuclear forces to support its silos and for some VIP missions, said Roger D. Connor, an aeronautics curator at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Over 440 still fly worldwide, according to Cirium.""It's a simple aircraft to fly by medium helicopter standards. It doesn't typically have much automation which can have both positive and negative implications for operators,"" Connor said. ""More automation means more opportunities for pilot confusion in certain circumstances, but also better capabilities in low-visibility conditions.""Iran's use of the Bell 212 remains pervasive, in part due to the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who struck deals to purchase hundreds of the helicopters and had plans to build a local variant, Nadimi said. Those already in the country at the time of the Islamic Revolution ended up being a key component of Iran's bloody war against Iraq in the 1980s.But as Western sanctions dried up the supply of parts, fewer of the aircraft were airworthy, despite efforts to locally overhaul them. That saw Iran engage in covert means to secure parts, sparking several U.S. criminal cases for those involved, who sought everything from safety equipment to full engines and night-vision goggles for the aircraft.Former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sought to blame sanctions for the crash. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded by saying America was ""not going to apologize for our sanctions regime at all"" as Iran has used aircraft to ""transport equipment to support terrorism.""""Ultimately, it's the Iranian government that is responsible for the decision to fly a ... helicopter in what was described as poor weather conditions, not any other actor,"" Miller said.Meanwhile, questions remain over why Iran couldn't find the helicopter for hours, even though one of the victims reportedly talked by cellphone with officials. Such calls, in theory, can be triangulated by security services. Also, it remains unclear if the helicopter had any emergency trackers, which are common on aircraft.While the investigation continues, Nadimi said he believed that the Bell 212 that flew Raisi did not have advanced avionics that could have been useful for low-visibility flight. However, he stressed that the major issue in the crash likely involves who allowed the flight to take off as the weather turned poor and whether the pilot faced pressure from his VIP passengers to make the journey no matter what.""Pilot error, human error might be to blame, but there was a chain of events that caused this crash, not just pilot error,"" Nadimi said. ""That helicopter should have been able to clear that terrain and fly safely to its destination. They should not have been dispatched for flying.""","Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash. They've rejected the possibility of an onboard ""explosion caused by sabotage"" or a ""cyberattack"" The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110813717,imgsize-52934,width-400,resizemode-4/110813717.jpg"

Pakistan's Punjab Assembly allows lawmakers to use of Punjabi language in house,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-punjab-assembly-allows-lawmakers-to-use-of-punjabi-language-in-house/articleshow/110783754.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in Pakistan 's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages , including Punjabi, in the house apart from English and Urdu after an amendment was made. A special committee of the Punjab Assembly, led by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan , approved on Thursday amendments allowing lawmakers to address the House in Punjabi, Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati in addition to English and Urdu, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.

Previously a member needed permission from the Speaker to use any language other than English and Urdu, which was not always granted.

The amendment in the assembly rules aimed to enhance accessibility for constituents who speak these languages, fostering a more representative and responsive legislative body, while the change reflects the multilingual nature of the province, enabling legislators to communicate and fully participate in legislative discussions effectively.

The Speaker stated that recognising and incorporating regional languages into official proceedings also demonstrates cultural respect and acknowledgement of the linguistic heritage of Punjab, thereby strengthening the connection between the Assembly and the people.

There is a controversy over whether Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati are just dialects of Punjabi and separate languages. Those using them consider that these were separate languages but hardcore Punjabi brand them as dialects.","Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages.

Putin issues dire warning to countries aiding Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-issues-dire-warning-to-countries-aiding-ukraine/articleshow/110775363.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine, signaling severe consequences for those who continue to support Kyiv in its ongoing conflict with Moscow. In a public address on Friday, Putin cautioned, ""Anyone who tries to intervene in the Ukraine war will be met with 'lightning-fast' retaliation."" This statement underscores the escalating tensions in the region as international support for Ukraine remains strong.Speaking from the Kremlin , Putin emphasized Russia 's readiness to respond decisively to any foreign involvement. ""We have all the instruments for this, ones that no one can boast of now,"" he stated. ""We will use them if we have to. I want everyone to know that."" The Russian leader's remarks were broadcast during a meeting with lawmakers in St. Petersburg, reflecting his unwavering stance on the Ukraine conflict.Putin's comments come as Ukraine continues to receive significant military and economic aid from Western nations, particularly the United States and European Union countries. This support has been crucial for Ukraine's defense efforts against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2022. Despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, Russia's military actions have persisted, leading to widespread devastation and loss of life.The Russian president's address included a veiled reference to Russia's nuclear capabilities, although he did not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The warning aligns with previous threats made by Russian officials, who have suggested that any significant interference could escalate to a nuclear confrontation.In response to Putin's warning, NATO and allied countries have reiterated their commitment to supporting Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated, ""Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast. We will not be deterred by threats, and we continue to stand united in defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty.""The international community remains divided on how best to address the conflict. While Western nations continue to supply arms and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Russia has condemned these actions as provocations and escalations. Putin's recent rhetoric suggests that any further support for Ukraine could trigger a severe and unpredictable reaction from Russia.The conflict in Ukraine has drawn global attention, with numerous calls for peace negotiations and ceasefires. However, diplomatic efforts have so far failed to produce a lasting resolution. The war has caused a significant humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and creating widespread instability in the region.As the situation continues to evolve, the risk of further escalation looms large. Analysts warn that Putin's latest comments could signal a new phase in the conflict, with potentially far-reaching implications for global security.""We are at a critical juncture,"" said military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. ""The stakes are incredibly high, and any misstep could lead to a wider confrontation.""With tensions running high, the international community is watching closely for any signs of escalation or attempts at de-escalation.

The New York Times reported she was registered to vote as a Democrat from 2000-2020 until changing her registration to no party affiliation.She has presided over a trial that has laid bare some of the president's son's darkest moments, including drug addiction. Outside her courtroom, international media strain to get a glimpse of members of the first family as they come and go.In her Senate confirmation hearing, Noreika said she admires judges who are prepared and ""willing to listen and give litigants an opportunity to be heard. ... They want to make people feel like they've been listened to and been given a fair shot.""If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.In a written answer to questions about sentencing from now-Vice President Kamala Harris, Noreika said she ""would listen to arguments from the parties, including requests for leniency, and consider statements made by victims. If confirmed, I would do my best to impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary.""'Born in Pittsburgh, the 57-year-old Noreika graduated from Lehigh University in 1988 before earning her master's degree in biology from Columbia University in 1990. She earned her law degree in 1993 from the University of Pittsburgh with magna cum laude honors.Noreika spent the next 25 years at the Delaware law firm of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell, where she earned partner in 2001. According to her Senate confirmation questionnaire, most of her work was in federal civil litigation involving intellectual property. It said she tried ""at least 30″ cases to verdict or final decision and most were nonjury trials. She also listed no criminal law experience.Asked to list ""all professional business, fraternal scholarly, civic or charitable"" organizations she had belonged to since law school, Noreika answered, ""None.""For pro bono work, Noreika wrote she had spent 15 years as a guardian ad litem for children in Delaware Family Court.""These cases have involved difficult custody issues, including allegations of sexual and physical abuse, neglect and abandonment,"" Noreika wrote. She described ""taking children out to lunch and to dinner and fun activities to get them to engage with me and trust me.""Her position as judge in the Hunter Biden criminal trial put her in the national spotlight and made her a target of speculation over political partisanship.It was Noreika who torpedoed a plea deal that would have settled the gun case when she raised concerns about the terms of the agreement in 2023.Noreika has presided over a Biden-related case before: In March 2023, she dismissed part of a defamation lawsuit brought by the owner of a Delaware computer repair shop where Hunter Biden left his laptop in 2019.Federal campaign finance records show she had donated at least $15,000 to political candidates between 2005-2014, most of it going to Republicans, including current US Sens.

France is ... our oldest and one of our deepest allies. And this will be an important moment to affirm that alliance and also look to the future and what we have to accomplish together,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters earlier this week.Sullivan said talks between the two men would touch on Russia's war with Ukraine, Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and policy issues ranging from climate change to artificial intelligence to supply chains.White House spokesperson John Kirby said the countries would announce a plan to work together on maritime law enforcement and the US Coast Guard and French navy would discuss increased cooperation.Biden and Macron are also expected to discuss strengthening Nato, and both have pledged their countries' support for Ukraine, though they have not agreed yet on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to help Kiev. A US treasury official said on Tuesday the United States and its G7 partners were making progress on that.Biden met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Paris on Friday, apologizing for a months-long delay by the US Congress in approving the latest package of aid, and Zelenskiy addressed France's National Assembly.During a speech at the American Cemetery in Normandy (Sp) on Thursday, the anniversary of the allied assault against Nazi German occupiers on French beaches in World War Two, Biden called on Western powers to stay the course with Ukraine.Macron and Biden will also confer on the situation in the middle east.Biden has been a staunch supporter of Israel, which is pursuing Hamas after it attacked the country in October, but tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths have soured Biden's left-leaning political base on Israel, hurting him as he runs against Republican Donald Trump for re-election in November.Beyond Ukraine, trade issues between the two sides of the Atlantic are likely to loom large.The US Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in August 2022, has incensed European officials; they see it as a protectionist move that siphons off investments from EU companies.Macron said during his state visit to Washington in 2022 that the package of subsidies could ""fragment the West"" and weaken the post-COVID European recovery at a time Washington is seeking allies against China and both sides confront Russia.He and European allies have won little concessions from Washington since, however, and French officials say their aim for this visit is still to try to ""re-synchronise"" the US and EU economic agendas.","French President Emmanuel Macron will host US President Joe Biden on Saturday.

"After editor's departure, Washington Post's publisher faces questions about phone hacking stories",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-editors-departure-washington-posts-publisher-faces-questions-about-phone-hacking-stories/articleshow/110811810.cms,"NEW YORK: The Washington Post 's new publisher is facing questions about whether he made efforts to conceal in his own newspaper and elsewhere his involvement in a British phone hacking scandal from his time working for Rupert Murdoch a decade ago. The weeklong saga, which began with the abrupt departure of the Post's executive editor Sunday night, offers a window into differences between approaches to journalism in Britain and the United States - and touches on delicate issues of trust in the American media community as it approaches a contentious and seismic presidential election .The publisher and CEO, Will Lewis , has denied any wrongdoing in Britain and at the Post.Lewis, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal, arrived in January to turn around the Post, which is awash in red ink and seen its digital readership drop by a half since 2020. Lewis is also the vice chairman of The Associated Press' board of directors.He announced a restructuring plan on Sunday that did not include the top news executive, Sally Buzbee, who apparently was either forced out or chose not to accept a demotion.Buzbee, the former top news executive at the AP, has led the Post newsroom for three years. She has not talked about her departure.This week, The New York Times reported that Lewis told Buzbee in a phone conversation last month that a development in litigation by Prince Harry about the phone hacking scandal did not warrant coverage in the Post.That sprawling case involved the alleged interception of voicemails of celebrities and royals by Murdoch-owned newspapers in Britain. Plaintiffs in a civil case have alleged that Lewis was involved in efforts to tamp down trouble, in part by destroying evidence. Lewis has denied this.The Times said Lewis told Buzbee that it would be a lapse in judgment to run the story, which was eventually published. The Post said Friday that that account was inaccurate and Lewis did not pressure Buazbee not to publish any stories. ""To suggest otherwise is completely false,"" the newspaper said in a statement.Buzbee did not respond to a message from the AP on Friday requesting comment on her own characterisation of the conversation.In mainstream American journalism, it's generally considered an ethical breach for a publisher to get involved in these kinds of news decisions, particularly one that involves him.Later Thursday, National Public Radio media reporter David Folkenflik wrote that Lewis, before he took over at the Post, ""repeatedly and heatedly"" offered NPR an exclusive interview about his plans - in return for Folkenflik dropping a story that he was writing about the executive's involvement in the phone hacking case.Folkenflik refused, and the story ran on December 20, 2023.Asked about this, Lewis called Folkenflik an activist instead of a journalist, telling the Post: ""I had an off-the-record conversation with him before I joined the Post and some six months later he has dusted it down, and made up some excuse to make a story of a non-story.""Folkenflik said that the offer, later confirmed by a press representative, was not off the record.""Certainly journalists at The New York Times, CNN and inside his own newsroom have concluded that what I reported this week about him and previously has been newsworthy,"" he said on Friday. ""I think that's the verdict on our carefully reported journalism. He can say what he wants, but that doesn't make this go away.""In an email to staff members Friday, Lewis acknowledged that he needed to improve on how well he listens and communicates. He invited them to a series of discussions next week on his restructuring plan.""I know trust has been lost because of scars from the past and the back-and-forth from this week,"" Lewis wrote. ""Let's leave those behind and start presuming the best of intent. If we do that, you will see where we are going in a different light. We don't have to agree about everything but we all are dedicated to building the future of The Post, and mapping our way there together.""In his Post comments, Lewis said that he decided early that he was not going to talk about his job dealing with the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal. ""And it's either right or wrong that I've done that,"" he said.Lewis grew up as a journalist in Britain, where there is a more bare-knuckle style of reporting. One of the editors he has hired in the Post's restructuring, Robert Winnett, worked with Lewis at the Daily Telegraph.One of their biggest stories, about abused expense accounts by members of Parliament, was based in part on records the newspaper reportedly paid for - an approach that would be forbidden in most American newsrooms.While some Post journalists have voiced questions and concerns about the restructuring plan that Lewis is pursuing, he has emphasised the need for decisive, urgent action. He told the staff in a meeting his week that he can't sugarcoat that ""people are not reading your stuff.""The turmoil at one of the nation's most important sources for political journalism comes at a delicate time, a month before Republicans are due to nominate Donald Trump for president and the campaign against incumbent President Joe Biden begins in earnest.

But the letter said the date picked by Jordan presented ""presents various scheduling conflicts.""It noted that the Trump prosecution is not yet finished. Trump, who was convicted of falsifying records to cover up hush money paid to a porn actor during the 2016 presidential campaign, is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11.

Bragg's office didn't rule that out, but said in the letter that it would ""evaluate the propriety"" of allowing an assistant district attorney to testify publicly about an active prosecution.Jordan, an Ohio Republican, has proposed withholding federal funding from any entity that attempts to prosecute a former president. He has also railed against what he's described as the ""weaponization of the federal government.""His committee successfully battled before to get a deposition from one former prosecutor who worked on Trump's case, Mark Pomerantz, over Bragg's initial objections.

"Harvey Weinstein was denied fair trial in appeal of LA rape conviction, says his legal team",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvey-weinstein-lawyers-argue-he-was-denied-fair-trial-in-appeal-of-la-rape-conviction/articleshow/110811603.cms,"NEW DELHI: Harvey Weinstein ’s legal team filed an appeal, asserting that he did not receive a fair trial in his 2022 Los Angeles conviction for rape and sexual assault, which resulted in a 16-year prison sentence.This appeal, submitted to California's second district court of appeal, follows the overturning of his significant 23-year #MeToo conviction in New York by the state's highest court six weeks prior.The appeal argues that the trial judge erred by not allowing evidence that the Italian model and actor he was convicted of raping had a sexual relationship with the director of a film festival that brought Weinstein and the woman to Los Angeles at the time of the alleged incident.Weinstein's lawyers argued that the judge deprived him of ""his constitutional rights to present a defence and led to a miscarriage of justice.""Weinstein’s attorneys argue that the trial judge erred by permitting the jury to learn about Weinstein's prior, now-overturned conviction in New York, and by allowing testimony from women regarding alleged assaults for which he was not charged, which unfairly biased the jury. This type of testimony had also contributed to the overturning of his conviction in New York, where he remains in custody as Manhattan prosecutors prepare for a retrial.""The introduction of this excessive, cumulative, and remote evidence of prior sexual assaults' simply signaled to the jury that the Defendant was a bad man who should be convicted of something irrespective of whether the prosecution proved its case,"" the filing said.In his California trial, Harvey Weinstein faced charges for sexually assaulting four women but was convicted solely for the assault on Evgeniya Chernyshova. Chernyshova testified that Weinstein unexpectedly appeared in her hotel room during the 2013 LA Italia Film Festival.Weinstein's legal team contends that Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench wrongly barred them from presenting Facebook messages as evidence, which they argue would have demonstrated that Chernyshova and Pascal Vicedomini, the festival's founder, were not merely friends and colleagues, as they testified, but had a sexual relationship. These messages, according to the defense, would have shown that both were lying under oath and supported the argument that Chernyshova was not in her hotel room but with Vicedomini during the alleged attack.These arguments mirror those presented in a motion for a new trial that Judge Lench had previously denied before sentencing.Weinstein has since enlisted appellate attorneys, including Jennifer Bonjean, a Chicago lawyer noted for her successful appeal that resulted in Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction being overturned in Pennsylvania.During the trial, Chernyshova was identified only as Jane Doe 1, but she later publicly revealed her identity and consented to being named in reports by the Associated Press through her lawyer.""Weinstein's appeal makes the same tired arguments that he previously made multiple times, without success, to the trial court,"" Chernyshova's attorney, David Ring, said in an email Friday. ""We are of the strong opinion that the trial court vetted the evidence appropriately and made all the correct decisions in its evidentiary rulings. We are confident that Weinstein's appeal will be denied and he will spend many years in prison.""The defense's appeal brief reveals that three jurors have signed affidavits expressing regret over their unanimous guilty verdict. The brief argues that these jurors stated they did not believe Evgeniya Chernyshova and Pascal Vicedomini were romantically involved. They indicated that access to evidence of their relationship would have influenced their judgment on the occurrence of the alleged rape.Weinstein’s attorneys also argue that Chernyshova's lawsuit, filed shortly after the verdict, suggests she may have had financial motives influencing her testimony, and they should have been allowed to question her about these motives during the trial.The defense had initially filed a notice of appeal in April 2023 and, after several extensions, submitted the brief on Friday. The prosecution has until August 6 to respond.","Weinstein’s attorneys argue that the trial judge erred by permitting the jury to learn about Weinstein's prior, now-overturned conviction in New York.

Two members of Ahmadi community shot dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-members-of-ahmadi-community-shot-dead/articleshow/110826007.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Two members of the minority Ahmadi community were shot dead in Pakistan ’s central Punjab province on Saturday, days after a vicious campaign was launched against the Supreme Court order releasing a person from the persecuted sect in a 2022 case.

The incident occurred in Sadullapur area of Mandi Bahauddin district.

The victims, a 50-year-old man and another 25 years old, were targeted by an unknown assailant when they were en route to a nearby market.

District police officer Ahmad Mohiuddin said the suspected attacker has been arrested from the same locality and the murder weapon seized. “He was involved in both shootings,” he claimed.

Following the incident, a large police force was deployed in the area.

Police said they first took both bodies into custody and moved them to a local government-run hospital for post-mortem analyses, after which the bodies would be handed over to the victims’ relatives.

There are an estimated four million Ahmadis in Pakistan, a country of over 220 million people. They live in fear in a Muslim majority country due to intimidation and threats of death.

The FIR against Baloch has ignited a legal battle and sparked widespread condemnation from journalists and activists.Taking to social media platform X, Ali Jan Maqsood, a practising lawyer and Baloch journalist said, ""Miserably failing to curb the voices of the oppressed, the Quetta police lodged FIR against Mahrang Baloch, Sebgat, Beebagr and 200 others as a means to further suppress their voices.

Shockingly, even children as young as 0-5 years old fell victim to sexual abuse, as reported by Geo News.The report delves into the categorisation of abusers, highlighting that acquaintances remain the primary perpetrators of child sexual abuse, followed by relatives, family members, strangers, and women abettors. Geographically, Punjab reported the highest number of cases, accounting for 75 per cent of the total, followed by 13 per cent in Sindh, 7 per cent in Islamabad, 3 per cent in KP, and 2 per cent in Balochistan, PoK, and GB combined.The report, termed 'Cruel Numbers 2023,' revealed that 91 per cent of the total reported cases were registered with the police, indicating an active role played by law enforcement in addressing the issue.

Imran Khan takes responsibility for '1971 tweet' but denies knowledge of associated video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-takes-responsibility-for-1971-tweet-but-denies-knowledge-of-associated-video/articleshow/110816058.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan stepped forward to accept accountability for a controversial tweet likening the current political landscape to the fall of Dhaka in 1971, however, he distanced himself from an accompanying video shared on his social media account, stating his unawareness of its contents, Dawn reported.The contentious post, disseminated on Imran's social media platform on May 26, featured a montage alongside a quote attributed to Khan urging the populace to examine the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report to discern the true betrayer between General Yahya Khan and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.Addressing journalists following a session at the accountability court in Adiala Jail, where he faces a 190 million Pounds corruption charge, Khan expressed remorse for his past references to Mujibur Rahman, conceding his failure to peruse the Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report at the time, as reported by Dawn.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder elucidated that the report delineated two objectives: averting the recurrence of similar errors and ascribing accountability for the debacle in Dhaka. He underscored the commission's indictment of General Yahya Khan for orchestrating actions to retain power, likening it to contemporary circumstances where the economy teeters on the brink of collapse.Attributing a staggering loss of PKR 1,100 billion to amendments in accountability laws introduced by the opposition coalition, Khan emphasised the dire consequences for a nation already grappling with economic challenges.Regarding his acquittal in the Cypher case, Imran called for an apology from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for baseless allegations.When queried about potential negotiations with political factions, prompted by a suggestion from the Supreme Court, Khan rebuffed the notion, asserting a preference for dialogue with genuine power brokers over intermediaries.Responding to criticism of his earlier stance on references to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report, Khan clarified that he had since familiarized himself with the report, leading to a shift in perspective.In regard to the contentious video associated with the social media post, Khan expressed bewilderment, asserting his inability to view the video while incarcerated and consequently refraining from commenting.Meanwhile, during interrogation by the FIA, Khan reiterated his commitment to cooperation, contingent upon the presence of legal representation, according to Dawn.In a parallel development, objections were raised during the corruption case hearing regarding the presiding judge's tenure, necessitating further deliberation on the matter.Conversely, PTI leader Omar Ayub lambasted the FIA's summons pertaining to Khan's tweet, denouncing the agency's director general and questioning his jurisdiction. Accusing the agency of overstepping its bounds, Ayub demanded scrutiny of the FIA's conduct.Amidst these developments, concerns were raised regarding the treatment of incarcerated PTI members, including Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, Yasmin Rashid, and Aliya Hamza, alleging violations of their human rights and inadequate facilities.Ali Muhammad Khan, another PTI stalwart, lamented the humiliation inflicted upon the nation through the incarceration of its leaders, underscoring the need for a dignified resolution to their predicament, Dawn reported.","Imran Khan apologises for past references to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Hamoodur Rahman Commission report.

This unrest stems from discontent over government regulations restricting border crossings to individuals with valid passports and visas, a departure from previous practices allowing passage based on identity cards, as reported by Dawn.Consequently, business activities halted, with banks and government offices shuttered, exacerbating economic strains. Notably, the National Bank relocated staff to ensure continuity amid the chaos.Security forces responded to the escalating violence with tear gas, seeking to disperse protesters attacking law enforcement personnel. Despite arrests and law enforcement efforts, the situation remains tense, prompting a stern warning against highway blockades, preserving vital transit routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan.Efforts to quell the unrest through dialogue have thus far yielded limited success, with protesters demanding the release of detained leaders and a resolution to their grievances.Meanwhile, Balochistan's Chief Minister Mir Safraz Bugti chaired a high-level meeting to address the crisis, emphasizing the imperative of upholding state authority while advocating for dialogue to address underlying grievances. However, attacks on security forces and property damage remain non-negotiable.In solidarity with the Chaman protesters, political parties staged demonstrations, advocating for the acceptance of demonstrators' demands and condemning the heavy-handed response to protests.Simultaneously, calls for a parliamentary committee in the National Assembly to address the situation underscored the urgency of dialogue and de-escalation. PTI leader Asad Qaisar appealed for a compassionate approach, advocating for dialogue over violence.Amidst the unrest, the Foreign Office reiterated visa regulations for border movement between Pakistan and Afghanistan, emphasising the need for strict adherence to visa requirements, Dawn reported.","Chaman, a border town in Pakistan's Balochistan, remains in turmoil.

Sharif is currently on a visit to China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, seeking to upgrade cooperation under the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative .In a statement, the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said during the meeting, the two sides discussed the significance of Gwadar as an important pillar of the CPEC and agreed to expedite the timely completion of all related infrastructure projects to transform Gwadar in Balochistan province into a regional economic hub.""They also expressed their firm commitment to protect CPEC from its detractors and adversaries and to upgrade CPEC in the form of enhanced cooperation,"" the statement said.The two leaders reaffirmed unwavering support for each other on core issues and expressed continued commitment and support for the high-quality development of the CPEC, Geo News reported.They also emphasised the timely completion of all ongoing projects with a special focus on industrial development, agriculture modernisation, Science & Technology and the development of Special Economic Zones for mutually beneficial and socio-economic development of Pakistan.Sharif also reaffirmed Pakistan's unflinching resolve to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel and projects in Pakistan.Chinese investment and financial support since 2013 have been key for the South Asian nation's struggling economy, including the rolling over of loans so that Islamabad can meet external financing needs at a time when foreign reserves are critically low.China has also invested billions in various power projects and road networks in Pakistan under the USD 65 billion CPEC plan, but the implementation of various projects has slowed in recent months.The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is seen as an attempt by China to further its influence abroad with infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments across the world.The recurring attacks on the Chinese personnel working on the CPEC projects by militant groups in Pakistan have become a major concern for China.In March, five Chinese and one Pakistani nationals were killed in a terrorist attack on their vehicle of the Dasu Hydropower Project undertaken by a Chinese company in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.During the talks, the two leaders discussed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and discussed regional and global developments of mutual interest.They noted that the Pakistan-China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership was characterised by mutual trust, shared principles and strategic convergence. Premier Li congratulated Prime Minister Sharif on Pakistan's election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.The two sides agreed to maintain high-level exchanges including strengthening institutional linkages at all tiers and in all spheres of bilateral cooperation. Pakistan and China will also continue to consult closely on issues of regional and global significance and multilateral fora, especially during the two-year tenure of Pakistan as a non-member of the UNSC.The delegation-level talks were followed by an MoU signing ceremony.

"Pakistan HC acquits Imran, Qureshi in state secrets leak case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-hc-acquits-imran-qureshi-in-state-secrets-leak-case/articleshow/110676116.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani high court acquitted Monday former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , who were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets, known as the cipher case. An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.

“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.

Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.

Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.

The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.

Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was found guilty of leaking classified information to his ex-wife. The pair were also convicted of giving each other gifts worth more than $100,000. They were both sentenced to five years in jail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110676153,imgsize-766298,width-400,resizemode-4/110676153.jpg"
