Parl panel omits G RAM G bill reference; its chairperson insists will discuss it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parl-panel-omits-g-ram-g-bill-reference-its-chairperson-insists-will-discuss-it/articleshow/126182233.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Congress MP-headed parliamentary committee, whose move to call a meeting on VB-G RAM G bill and comparing it with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme had drawn protest from the panel's BJP members, has revised the agenda of its Dec 29 sitting and omitted any direct reference to the new law.The original subject of the meeting of the standing committee on the rural development and panchayati raj was a briefing by the rural development department on “Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin Bill and its comparison with the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme)”.However, some BJP members of the panel saw red in the reference to the bill, now a law after assent from the President and gazette notification, as its provisions are yet to be rolled out.That Congress and other opposition parties have stridently criticised the new law which replaces the UPA-era Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) meant that BJP members believed the meeting's agenda, which is generally a discretion of chairman, was aimed at political point-scoring.In an apparent attempt to defuse any row, the agenda is now revised as ""briefing by the representatives of the department of rural development on the subject ‘MGNREGA and other issues relating thereto”, deleting any direct reference to the G RAM G law.However, the change may not preclude political confrontation in the Dec 29 meeting as the committee’s chairman Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, a Congress MP from Odisha, insisted that they will still discuss the new law as it has now received President’s assent, which was not the case when the initial agenda was circulated. “We will discuss it,” he told TOI.Signalling differences with the chairman BJP MP Vivek Thakur, a member of the committee, was dismissive of the changed agenda. “The improvisation of the agenda is meaningless still. Once G RAM G bill is gazetted and the date of implementation is announced through it, it makes sense to discuss the new law. But right now, this smacks of an intent to politicise the agenda of a standing committee.”The ‘VB G RAM G’ bill had drawn strong protest from opposition members, and Ulaka had written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that it should be referred to his committee for scrutiny, a drmand not accepted by the govt.","The original subject of the meeting of the standing committee on the rural development and panchayati raj was a briefing on the VB-G RAM G bill.

CHANDIGARH: Twenty-eight years after a CISF constable was sacked on charges of assault and misconduct with seniors, on Oct 5, 1998, Punjab and Haryana high court has directed his reinstatement, observing that the punishment was excessive.The bench of Justice Sandeep Moudgil said that past conduct could not be used to justify removal from service when current allegations were unsubstantiated. HC was of the view that punishment must be commensurate with the gravity of misconduct and ""should not shock the conscience"".""Disciplinary proceedings in service matters, particularly those involving civil or quasi-military forces such as CISF, are governed by the twin principles of natural justice and reasoned decision-making. While the authority enjoys wide discretion in matters of discipline, the exercise of such discretion is judicially reviewable to ensure it is not arbitrary,"" HC said, while allowing a petition filed by Ravinder Kumar Rana, a resident of Ropar in Punjab.","A CISF constable was sacked on charges of assault and misconduct with seniors.

Inqilab Moncho issues ultimatum, warns of tougher protests



Government promises speedy trial as arrests continue







The brother of slain youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi accused Bangladesh’s interim government, of orchestrating the killing to destabilise the country and derail the upcoming national election in February.Sharif Omar bin Hadi, speaking at a protest rally in Shahbagh on Tuesday, said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder, which took place just days after the election schedule was announced. Osman Hadi, a convenor of the political platform Inqilab Moncho, was shot on December 12 and later died of his injuries in Singapore on December 18.Addressing a “Shahidi Shopoth” programme organised by Inqilab Moncho outside the National Museum, Omar Hadi accused “a quarter within the government” of planning the killing to disrupt the electoral process. “It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” he said as quoted by The DailyStar.He said his brother had been firmly in favour of holding elections by February and had actively worked on the ground to prepare for them. “Respecting his wish, we demand that the election environment is not disturbed,” Omar Hadi said, warning that the government had so far shown “no visible progress” in delivering justice.He claimed Osman Hadi was targeted because he refused to bow to any agency or “foreign masters”. If justice was denied, Omar Hadi warned, those responsible would one day be forced to flee the country. Protesters later took an oath vowing to remain on the streets until “speedy and exemplary justice” was secured.Earlier, Inqilab Moncho’s member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber, speaking as the keynote speaker, alleged a “deep conspiracy” involving international intelligence agencies and domestic “fascist associates” aimed at undermining Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the gains of the July uprising.The platform has given the government a 30-working-day deadline to identify and arrest the killers, warning of tougher nationwide programmes if the demand is not met. While the group said it would pause formal protests on December 25, the day BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is due to return to Bangladesh, it announced wall-writing and social media campaigns across December 24 and 25, with further agitation planned from December 26.In a parallel development, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina also blamed the interim government for the deteriorating law-and-order situation, saying the killing reflected “lawlessness” under Yunus.The interim government has rejected suggestions of inaction, with Law Adviser Asif Nazrul saying the case would be tried under the Speedy Trial Tribunal Act, requiring completion within 90 days of the investigation report being filed. Home Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the case was being treated as a top priority.Joint forces comprising police, the Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh have arrested at least 10 people so far, including family members of the prime suspect, Faisal Karim Masud. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to arrest the main accused.Osman Hadi’s killing came a day after the Bangladesh Election Commission announced February 12 as the date for the next national polls. A prominent figure of the 'July Uprising' and a potential candidate for Dhaka-8, his death had fuelled major protests in Bangladesh.","Sharif Omar bin Hadi said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari has recounted how he came face to face with Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh just hours before the latter was assassinated in Tehran, linking the incident to what he described as the growing role of technology in modern conflict and national security.Speaking at a book launch event, Gadkari said he had travelled to Iran at the request of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to represent India at the swearing-in ceremony of Iran’s newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian. According to the minister, foreign dignitaries were staying at a five-star hotel in Tehran ahead of the ceremony.“I had gone for the Iranian Prime Minister's ceremony. There is a 5-star hotel there where all heads of state stayed. Modi ji had sent me,” Gadkari said.He recalled noticing one individual among the dignitaries who was not a head of state. “I wondered who he was. I also shook hands and asked. He was the head of Hamas,” he said, adding that Haniyeh later walked into the ceremony alongside Iran’s president and chief justice, while other delegates followed.Gadkari further described how he was woken early in the morning amid the chaos of Haniyeh’s assassinations.“I also came to my hotel and after eating dinner, went to sleep. At 4 o'clock, the ambassador came and knocked on the door saying ""Sir, we have to evacuate."" I asked why. He said there's been a big problem. What happened? He said the Hamas leader who was here yesterday, a powerful man, was killed in his room.”Iranian authorities later confirmed that Haniyeh was killed at around 1.15am on July 31, 2024, while staying in a highly secure military complex under the supervision of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His bodyguard was also killed in the attack, according to official statements cited by the Associated Press.Gadkari told the audience that the exact method of the assassination remained unclear. He went on to suggest how the future high-tech is important from the perspective of national security, modern warfare, and critical infrastructure.“No one knows from where the missile was fired, where it entered - now some say it was his mobile phone number, he was specially hidden in one place in a bungalow, went to that room and killed him there. So the coming time is futuristic, technology and futuristic vision for development in defence, agriculture, industry, trade, business export - we will have to do all this.”At the same event, Gadkari remarked that strong nations are difficult to target, citing Israel as an example of how technological and military capability translate into global influence.Iran’s revolutionary guards authorities had said a short-range missile was used to strike the building where Haniyeh was staying.The Telegraph claimed that Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad may have orchestrated the killing by planting explosives inside the guesthouse, citing Iranian officials.

Colonel Bath accused SIT of 'shielding' accused policemen

MOHALI: CBI has filed a chargesheet in a Mohali court against four Punjab Police personnel in connection with the assault on Colonel Pushpinder Bath, naming an inspector as the prime accused.The central agency has dropped charges of attempted murder and instead invoked charges for 'causing grievous hurt' and 'wrongful restraint'. The chargesheet names inspector Ronnie Singh as 'principal accused' in the case. On the intervening night of March 13-14 this year, a group of policemen, in civilian clothes, thrashed Colonel Bath and his son over a parking dispute in Patiala.The Armyman and his son were standing beside their car at a roadside eatery when a group of men, later identified as cops in civilian clothes, asked him to move his vehicle to make space for theirs.The family has alleged that this exchange escalated into violence, following which more than a dozen police personnel assaulted Colonel Bath and his son with rods and sticks, injuring both of them. The FIR was registered eight days later on the Colonel's complaint.Initially, Patiala police named inspectors Harry Boparai, Ronnie Singh and Harjinder Dhillon in the FIR under BNS sections for attempted murder, causing hurt, wrongful restraint and criminal intimidation.Another inspector's name was added on charges of rioting and insulting a religion.Dissatisfied with the probe, Col Bath approached Punjab and Haryana high court, which handed the case to Chandigarh Police on April 3. On July 14, the Colonel filed a petition in HC, accusing Chandigarh SIT of 'shielding' the accused cops.On July 16, HC handed the case to CBI, remarking that Chandigarh Police probe was ""tainted"" and there were ""no prospects of a free and fair investigation"". ""The court is convinced that the investigating agency is not only trying to create loopholes in the investigation but trying to make craters in the investigation so as to ensure that once the chargesheet is filed before the court, the case of the prosecution should hardly be able to crawl in court,"" Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj said in his scathing remarks.Around a week after this, four accused cops, who were suspended till then, reported at their new postings. Thus far, police had told the court that all of them were ""untraceable"". Col Bath's family criticised the rejoining, saying the officers had 'surfaced' to avoid being declared 'proclaimed offenders' (POs).",CBI files chargesheet against four Punjab Police personnel in connection with assault on Colonel Pushpinder Bath.

Major anti-Naxal success: Rs 1.2-crore bounty Maoist Ganesh Uike among four gunned down in Odisha

Ganesh killing a turning point: Shah

BHUBANESWAR/BERHAMPUR/HYDERABAD: He vanished at will - sometimes robed as a swamiji, stick in hand, towel over his shoulder - shedding names as easily as trails.On Thursday, bullets caught up with Maoist commander Paka Hanumanthu, better known as Ganesh Uike, with a collective bounty of Rs 1.1 crore, who refused to surrender and died in a security operation in Odisha.The 69-year-old CPI (Maoist) central committee member - the Odisha in-charge of the banned outfit and a veteran of more than four decades underground - was among four Maoists killed before dawn in Kandhamal district, a hilly, forested region in southern Odisha bordering Chhattisgarh. His death raised the number of rebels killed in Kandhamal to six over the past 24 hours.Security agencies linked Ganesh to several major Maoist operations, most notably the May 2013 Jhiram Ghati ambush in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh, where a convoy of Congress functionaries was attacked, killing at least 27 on the spot and wounding 34. That episode kept him high on most-wanted lists across Maoist-affected states.Thursday's operation followed the Dec 22 surrender of 22 Maoists from Chhattisgarh in Malkangiri district in southern Odisha. Police said credible intelligence from the surrendered cadres helped track Ganesh's movements.Two Maoists, including an area committee member, were killed Wednesday. Ganesh fell hours later, becoming the first Maoist commander and central committee member neutralised in Odisha.Kandhamal SP Harish BC said security forces found four bodies — two men and two women — all in uniform, along with two INSAS rifles and a .303 rifle. “Ganesh’s identity has been verified. Identities of the other three cadres are being established,” he said.Home minister Amit Shah called the operation a turning point. “A significant milestone towards Naxal-free Bharat,” his office said in a post.“We are resolved to eliminate Naxalism before the 31st of March 2026.” Shah has set March 2026 as the nationwide deadline to end Maoist insurgency and said Odisha is on the verge of becoming free of left-wing extremism.Police sources said Ganesh showed no signs of surrender. In recent months, he had publicly criticised central committee colleague Chandranna for surrendering to Telangana police & insisted the movement would continue despite setbacks. Ganesh carried bounties of Rs 40 lakh in Chhattisgarh and Rs 25 lakh each in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.Born in Pullemla village of Nalgonda district in Telangana, Ganesh — known by aliases Rupa, Rajesh Tiwari, Chamu, Chamru and Somudu — studied in Nalgonda, left his BSc unfinished, and went underground in 1982 amid violent campus politics.He later emerged as an organiser and commander in West Bastar, a dense forest belt in southern Chhattisgarh, serving as secretary and in-charge of the divisional committee and overseeing the south sub-zonal bureau.","Maoist commander Paka Hanumanthu, better known as Ganesh Uike, with a collective bounty of Rs 1.1 crore, refused to surrender and died in a security operation in Odisha.

JAKHWALI (FATEHGARH SAHIB): In the season of giving, a 75-year-old Sikh woman has donated land for the construction of a mosque in a village in Punjab's Fatehgarh Sahib district, with Sikh and Hindu families also pitching in with money.The heart-warming gesture comes from Jakhwali, a predominantly Sikh village (400-500 families) with sizable Hindu (150 families) and Muslim (100 families) populations.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: An FIR was registered on Thursday against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Adil Ahmad Khan for allegedly outraging the religious feelings of Christians.The FIR was filed on the complaint of a lawyer after the party posted a video on its official social media accounts on Dec 17 and 18, featuring a skit performed at Connaught Place. According to the complainant, the skit depicts Santa Claus in a humorous and derogatory manner.The controversy stems from the scenes in which a person dressed as Santa is shown collapsing on the street and is used as a ""prop"" to seemingly deliver a political message. The complainant alleged that the AAP functionaries mocked Santa by showing CPR being performed on him — ""a direct insult"" to the sanctity of St Nicholas and Christmas.BJP called it an ""indecent and objectionable act"" and ""a mockery of religious faith"".Denying the allegations, Bharadwaj said the skit helped take the issue of Delhi's air pollution to the masses, thus putting both the city and Union govts under pressure.The complainant further alleged that the actions were deliberate and malicious as they coincided with the final days of Advent. A case was registered under Sections 299, 302, and 3(5) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that pertain to deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings, with common intention.The FIR states that the collective actions of Bharadwaj, a former minister; Jha, the Burari MLA; and Khan, a national executive member of AAP, also threaten communal harmony in the city.The complainant furnished AAP's Instagram handle and a Facebook link to the video as primary evidences.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said, ""Such conduct is not befitting of any socially responsible individual. Those who work as public representatives in the political arena have an obligation to maintain their seriousness and dignity.""AAP alleged that the FIR was part of a broader pattern of BJP intimidating opposition functionaries using Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and now Delhi Police. ""Their propaganda is being exposed, so they are scared. We need to expose them more and scare them further. BJP workers are now donning the mask of Christians,"" Bharadwaj, AAP Delhi unit president, said.The party also claimed that BJP's objections over issues like this have been selective. ""Caps of individuals dressed as Santa were recently yanked off in Lajpat Nagar and they were threatened, abused and chased away. However, the religious sentiment of no Christian worker of BJP was hurt in that case,"" said Bharadwaj.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Adil Ahmad Khan are accused of outraging the religious feelings of Christians.

Live streaming clips spark backlash as Clavicular claims he acted in self-defense







Controversial online streamer Braden “Clavicular” has reportedly been banned from Kick after a disturbing incident during a live broadcast. The clips on X appeared to show the young content creator allegedly running over a person while driving a Tesla Cybertruck. The incident quickly spread across X and Reddit, sparking outrage and concern.Soon after the videos went viral, Clavicular’s Kick channel became inaccessible.

In the footage, a person could be seen lying across the windshield of Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck. Someone off-camera was heard telling him to start driving. Moments later, the vehicle appeared to move forward, allegedly running over the individual.Another clip from the same livestream later surfaced. At that moment, Clavicular spoke to someone wearing a reflective safety jacket on the road.He stated that he acted out of fear and thought he was in danger. He claimed people were surrounding his car and said he thought they were armed. He explained that he could not see clearly and believed weapons were visible through their clothing.As speculation grew, an associate of Kick star Adin Ross shared an update during a live broadcast. The associate stated that the person involved in the incident was not dead. Adin Ross responded to the update by questioning why viewers were reacting negatively in the chat.Ross later revealed that he had spoken directly with Clavicular after the streamer’s Kick channel went offline.

‘We did nothing wrong’: Indian truck drivers challenge California over mass licence cancellations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-did-nothing-wrong-indian-truck-drivers-challenge-california-over-mass-licence-cancellations/articleshow/126177821.cms,"Truck drivers say they are being punished for state errors

Federal pressure and political fallout

Livelihoods and supply chains at risk





Thousands of Indian truck drivers in California have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled. Drivers say the move threatens their livelihoods and has left their families in limbo. The lawsuit follows decisions by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke licences issued to immigrant drivers after a federal audit flagged problems with expiry dates. Many of the affected drivers are Punjabi Sikhs, according to advocacy groups, who say the crackdown has led to increased profiling of drivers in the industry.The dispute centres on around 20,000 commercial driver’s licences (CDLs) that the DMV says were issued with expiration dates extending beyond the period drivers were authorised to stay and work in the United States. On 6 November, the agency sent 60-day cancellation notices to roughly 17,000 drivers, a figure that has since risen as more cases were reviewed.Civil rights groups argue the problem stems from clerical mistakes made by the DMV itself, not wrongdoing by drivers. Under California law, they say, the agency is required either to correct such errors or allow licence holders to reapply for amended documents. Instead, the DMV halted the issuing, renewal and correction of non-resident CDLs, leaving drivers with no clear way to fix the issue.“The state of California must help these drivers because the clerical errors threatening their livelihoods are of the state’s own making,” said Munmeeth Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which filed the class-action lawsuit alongside the Asian Law Caucus.Advocacy groups say the crackdown followed increased scrutiny from the Trump administration after a fatal truck crash in Florida earlier this year became a national political issue. Federal officials accused several states, including California, of lax licensing standards and pushed tougher enforcement of immigration and English-language proficiency rules for commercial drivers.The Sikh Coalition says the response has had wider consequences, including racial profiling of Sikh truckers, many of whom wear turbans and beards as part of their faith. Industry figures warn that stricter federal policies could remove hundreds of thousands of drivers from the workforce nationwide over the coming years.For drivers, the immediate impact is stark. Losing a CDL means losing the legal right to work, while the threatened cancellation of regular driving licences would prevent them from driving at all. Many affected drivers are the sole earners for their families and have invested heavily in trucks, homes and small transport businesses.“If the court does not step in, we will see a devastating wave of unemployment that harms families and destabilises supply chains,” Kaur said.The DMV has declined to comment on the lawsuit but has previously said it is prepared to reissue licences if federal objections are lifted. The plaintiffs argue the agency already has the authority under state law to correct or reinstate the licences without waiting for Washington.","Thousands of Indian truck drivers in California have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled.

A day after another Hindu man was lynched to death in Bangladesh's Rajbari district, Mohammad Yunus-led interim government on Friday said that the incident was not related to communal violence, alleging that the victim - Amrit Mondal alias Samrat - was ""accused"" in several serious criminal cases.Bangladeshi government said that it has taken note of the spread of what it termed ""misleading information"" on social media regarding the tragic killing which took place in in the Pangsha Police Station area of Rajbari.""According to police information and preliminary investigations, it is clearly evident that the incident is in no way related to communal violence,"" the government said in a statement.According to the government, Mondal was a listed top criminal wanted in several criminal cases. The incident was triggered after Mondal entered the area with the intent of collecting extortion money.""Rather, it arose from a violent situation stemming from extortion and criminal activities. The deceased, Amrit Mondal alias Samrat, was a listed top criminal who had entered the area with the intent of collecting extortion money. At one stage, he lost his life during a clash with agitated local residents,"" the statement read.""It is noteworthy that Amrit Mondal alias Samrat was accused in multiple serious criminal cases, including murder and extortion cases filed in 2023, and arrest warrants had been issued against him in those cases,"" it added.According to locals, Samrat had formed a criminal gang and had long been involved in extortion and other criminal activities. After remaining in hiding in India for a long time, he recently returned home and allegedly demanded extortion money from Shahidul Islam, a resident of the village.According to the police investigation, Mondal and his associates entered the area with the intention of extorting money.Mondal and members of his group went to Shahidul's house to collect the money. When the occupants raised an alarm shouting ""robbers"", locals rushed to the spot and beat Samrat.His other associates managed to flee, while Selim was caught with weapons.""Police arrested his associate, Selim, from the scene along with one foreign-made pistol and one pipe gun. Three cases have already been filed in connection with this incident, and law enforcement agencies are continuing their investigation,"" the statement read.Meanwhile, the interim government condemned the killing and said it does not support any form of unlawful action.""The government strongly condemns this killing. The government wishes to state unequivocally that it does not support any form of extrajudicial activity, mob violence, or unlawful conduct under any circumstances. Legal action will be taken against all those directly or indirectly involved in the incident,"" it said.The statement also expressed concern over attempts to project the incident as a communal attack.""The government urges all concerned to act responsibly and refrain from spreading misleading, provocative, or communal statements,"" the statement said.Reiterating its ""commitment"" to law and order, the interim government's statement read, ""The government remains firmly committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice. Bangladesh is a country of communal harmony, and any attempt to undermine the nation's peace and stability will be dealt with firmly.""Last week, Hindu youth Das was lynched and his body set on fire in Mymensingh district after a mob accused him of blasphemy.The interim government led by Mohammed Yunus condemned the incident.""We wholeheartedly condemn lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh. There is no space for such violence in new Bangladesh. The perpetrators of this heinous crime will not be spared,"" a statement posted on X said.The killings come amid ongoing unrest in the country and heightened concern over attacks on religious minorities and media institutions.","A Hindu man was lynched to death in Bangladesh's Rajbari district.

Ijardar later secured bail.Assistant commissioner of Police Deep Vakil said Ijardar, a resident of Bhakti Bungalow beside the post office in Sultanabad village, was arrested after he stopped vehicles and lit firecrackers on a public road at around 8pm.“Bursting firecrackers on a public road is a clear violation of the Commissioner of Police’s notification, so he was booked immediately after the video went viral. During legal proceedings, he apologised and promised not to repeat the act,” Vakil added.Witnesses said the celebration caused heavy traffic congestion, and Ijardar allegedly threatened a motorist with flames from the firecrackers in his hand.This is not the first controversy involving Ijardar. In July, he reportedly threatened a woman, Darshana Patel, over fixing posters in Sultanabad, abusing her in front of her son with the help of his bodyguards.The Dumas police registered a case based on Patel’s complaint.A case has also been registered against Ijardar under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which deals with disobedience to orders issued by public officials.Authorities said the incident violated the Police Commissioner’s notification and caused inconvenience to the public.","Deepak Ijardar, 58, held firecrackers while stopping vehicles.

US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics, calling them ""sleazebags"" and accusing them of having close ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before ""dropping him like a dog"" and then ""blaming Trump. "" He also fired shots at Democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.""Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump posted, ""Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth, only to 'drop him like a dog' when things got too HOT.""He claimed these critics ""falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J Trump.""Trump further went on to assert that he was ""actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.""The US President further alleged that those who would be named in the ""ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt"" would largely turn out to be Democrats.He said, ""When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife 'Republican,' Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam - and had nothing to do with 'TRUMP.'""He also criticised the media coverage on Epstien files singling out The New York Times.""The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election 'Reporting,' even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage.

Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Epstein, marking the largest disclosure so far in the long-running investigation.The newly released files contain multiple references to Trump, including an email from a prosecutor noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.In a response to the latest files released, the DOJ said that some of the latest documents released from the Epstein files contained ""untrue and sensationalist claims"" against Trump, which were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 US election.The latest disclosure follows criticism of an earlier tranche of records, some of which were briefly removed from the DOJ's online portal over concerns about protecting victims’ identities. The files were later restored after authorities determined that no victims were depicted in the disputed material.The newly released material also included hundreds of video and audio files, as well as surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.","US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics.

Braden “Clavicular” and N3on red liquid incident sparks fresh backlash as past Cybertruck livestream resurfaces





Braden “Clavicular” and streamer N3on are once again at the center of online attention after a disturbing video spread fast on social media. The clip shows both streamers being splashed with a red liquid by a man during a public encounter. The moment shocked viewers and quickly crossed hundreds of thousands of views on X. Many online users claim the man in the video is the same person who was run over by Clavicular’s Cybertruck during a livestream months ago. That earlier incident had already caused strong backlash and heavy debate across social platforms.In the new clip, N3on appears stunned, while Clavicular rushes toward the man after the liquid is thrown. The man can be heard shouting as people nearby react in panic. The liquid has not been confirmed. The video was shared by X user @korzawyd, who claimed the man had been stalking and harassing Clavicular for months.As the clip spread, social media split into two loud sides. Some users defended the man, while others strongly criticized his actions.One X user wrote,“Doesn’t mean it’s okay to run someone over + take their life wtf.”Another user pushed back, saying,“The number of idiots I’ve seen on here trying to defend the stalker just because they don’t like the streamer is insane!!!”Soon after, an associate of Adin Ross stepped in to clear a key claim. The associate said the man who was run over during the earlier livestream did not die.The Cybertruck incident had already shocked many viewers. Clips from the livestream spread widely on X and Reddit, putting Clavicular under heavy public pressure.After the backlash, Clavicular’s Kick channel reportedly became inaccessible. According to The Express Tribune, users trying to open the channel saw a message that read,“Oops, something went wrong. We can’t find the page you’re looking for.”The outlet noted this message often appears when an account is banned. However, there has been no official confirmation of a ban.In another clip from the same livestream, Clavicular is seen speaking to a person in a reflective safety jacket. He says he acted out of fear and self-defense. He explains that his vehicle was surrounded and he believed people nearby were armed.As of now, Clavicular has not released any public statement about the red liquid video involving N3on.

Candace Owens argues grief does not exempt leadership from scrutiny







In the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination, fault lines inside the conservative movement have widened, and few voices have amplified that tension more than Candace Owens. The commentator has now turned her attention squarely toward Erika Kirk, challenging how the Turning Point USA figurehead has handled public scrutiny, internal dissent, and mounting conspiracy claims.What began as sympathy for a grieving widow has evolved into a broader argument about accountability, transparency, and leadership during moments of crisis. Owens’ remarks have sparked intense debate online, forcing conservatives to confront uncomfortable questions about power, responsibility, and credibility.Owens has said she agrees, in principle, that burial arrangements and family mourning should remain private. “I think that when people are being buried and where they're being buried and how their funerals are done, that is very private matter,” she acknowledged.But she drew a sharp line between privacy and selective engagement, accusing Erika of what she called “Meghan Markle syndrome ... where you want privacy when you want it, but you want publicity whenever you want it, and that just doesn't work.”The controversy extends beyond personal boundaries. Owens expressed frustration that Erika claimed she lacked time to address conspiracy theories while continuing public appearances. “She has time,” Owens said. “It is just what she means to say: not her priority.”Erika, for her part, has defended her stance, stating, “Call me names, I don’t care. ... But when you go after my family, my Turning Point USA family, my [The] Charlie Kirk Show family… no.” She also emphasized her focus on accountability, saying, “I want justice for my husband.”Owens closed with a broader critique that ignited backlash: “this is why there are many people who do not believe that women are equipped to lead companies,” arguing the response she observed was “an unbelievably emotional response that is absent of any logic.”The exchange has become more than a personal feud, it now represents a defining moment for Turning Point USA and the movement surrounding it.Also Read: “She’s a sociopath”: Candace Owens faces growing credibility backlash as critics question missing Egyptian planes evidence","Candace Owens argues grief does not exempt leadership from scrutiny.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"Charlie Kirk's KILLER In Court; Tyler Robinson Defiant, Shows No Remorse | Dramatic Scenes On Cam





Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.

The files also contained many of mentions of US President Donald Trump, although it includes an email from a prosecutor pointing out the flights that Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.The Department of Justice said that some material includes “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump that were submitted to the FBI shortly before the 2020 election. The department said those allegations were unfounded and false, but the records were being made public in the interests of legal transparency, with protections in place for Epstein’s victims.Among nearly 30,000 pages of material is now available on the official Justice Department website.An FBI intake report dated October 27, 2020, records a tip from a former limousine driver. According to that report, the driver described a disturbing phone conversation he claimed he overheard in 1995 involving Trump and Epstein.The driver’s account says the woman later told him she had contacted police about what had occurred, and was then found dead in January 2000 by suicide.The details in the file are heavily redacted, and the authorities have made little to no determination about the allegations’ credibility.In an accompanying statement on X on Tuesday, DOJ addressed the claims. It said some documents contain “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.""The authotrity described the allegations as lacking any credible basis. “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the department said.The DOJ reitarated its commitment to transparency and the legal requirement to release the records, but also said that the inclusion of such claims in the files does not make them factual.Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In public statements this week, the MAGA chief called the focus on the Epstein case as a distraction by Democrats, asserting that he “cut ties” with Epstein long before the pedophile's arrest in 2019.The release covers a range of material, not just the unverified rape allegation. Internal emails in the files show Trump was recorded as having travelled on Epstein’s private jet in the 1990s more times than previously known — at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996.Trump’s association with Epstein in the 1990s is well documented, but inclusion in flight logs or social records is not itself an accusation of illegal behaviour.DOJ is constantly being pressured by Democrats for not releasing the full bulk of files. Supporters of the Transparency Act say the public has a right to see government records, even if they contain unverified claims.The latest release follows criticism of an earlier batch of Epstein records, some of which were temporarily removed from the DOJ’s online portal amid concerns about protecting victims’ identities. Authorities later restored those files after determining no victims were shown in the disputed photos.","Department of Justice released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein.

'Merry Christmas to all': US releases footage of strikes against ISIS in Nigeria — watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/merry-christmas-to-all-us-releases-footage-of-strikes-against-isis-in-nigeria-watch/articleshow/126181153.cms,"Trump Says Will Strike Back After ISIS Gunman Kills U.S. Service Members In Syria Attack





The US department of war on Thursday released a footage of strikes against ISIS terrorists in northeast Nigeria.The video shows a missile being launched from an aircraft carrier.This comes after US President Donald Trump announced “powerful and deadly strike” against ISIS terrorists whom he described as “terrorist scum”.The precision strikes mark the first attack by US forces in Nigeria under Trump, and come after the Republican unexpectedly berated the West African nation in October and November, saying Christians there faced an “existential threat” that amounted to “genocide” amid Nigeria's myriad armed conflicts.In a post on Truth Social, US President Trump said the strike was carried out “at my direction as Commander in Chief” and targeted ISIS militants.He alleged that the group had been “targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries”.He added that the “Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing”.Trump further said that under his leadership, the US would not allow “radical Islamic terrorism to prosper”.He concluded the post by saying, “May God bless our military, and Merry Christmas to all, including the dead terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.”Trump, in recent months, has repeatedly spoken about the situation of Christians in Nigeria. In November, he had called on his secretary of defence to “prepare for possible action” and warned that the US could enter Nigeria “guns-a-blazing” to protect the Christian population in Africa’s most populous country, reported CNN.The diplomatic offensive was welcomed by some but interpreted by others as inflaming religious tensions in Africa's most populous country, which has seen bouts of sectarian violence in the past.Nigeria's government and independent analysts reject framing the country's violence in terms of religious persecution — a narrative long used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe.Meanwhile, the Nigerian foreign ministry also confirmed the attack launched by the US and said, “Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism,” the foreign ministry said in a statement released early on Friday.“This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes,” in the country's northwest, it added.","US releases footage of strikes against ISIS terrorists in northeast Nigeria.

Biggest Epstein SHOCKER! Kash Patel-Led FBI Hands Over 1 MILLION More Files To Trump DOJ





WASHINGTON: The justice department said on Wednesday that it had discovered more than 1 million more documents potentially related to the investigation of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - increasing the amount previously known and lengthening the time it will take to release the material.To date, the department has released about 130,000 pages of information, some of it redacted, to comply with a law passed by Congress requiring the disclosure of most of the material about Epstein.Under the law, the administration may withhold records that identify victims or information that would ""jeopardize an active federal investigation.""The law gave the justice department a deadline of last Friday to release the files, and a batch of about 100,000 pages was released that day. But over the weekend, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said about 1 million pages of information were being reviewed, and the full release would take a few more weeks.","To date, the department has released about 130,000 pages of information, some of it redacted, to comply with a law passed by Congress requiring the disclosure of most of the material about Epstein.

Trump Says Will Strike Back After ISIS Gunman Kills U.S. Service Members In Syria Attack





US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he had ordered a “powerful and deadly strike” against Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists in northwest Nigeria, accusing the group of targeting and killing Christians in the region.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the strike was carried out “at my direction as Commander in Chief” and targeted ISIS militants whom he described as “terrorist scum”.He alleged that the group had been “targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries”.“I have previously warned these terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” Trump wrote.He added that the “Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing”.Trump further said that under his leadership, the US would not allow “radical Islamic terrorism to prosper”.

More than medicine: How a weight-loss drug helped US envoy free prisoners in Belarus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-than-medicine-how-a-weight-loss-drug-helped-us-envoy-free-prisoners-in-belarus/articleshow/126179028.cms,"



Diplomacy rarely hinges on small talk, but in an unusual backchannel between Washington and Minsk, a casual exchange about weight loss became part of a negotiation that helped secure the release of political prisoners in Belarus. The episode centres on John P. Coale, a senior US envoy with close ties to President Donald Trump, and Belarus’s long-serving leader Alexander Lukashenko, a figure widely criticised for authoritarian rule.According to reporting by The Wall Street Journal, the moment unfolded during a dinner where formalities gave way to personal conversation. Lukashenko remarked on Coale’s slimmer appearance and asked whether he had lost weight. Coale said he had, crediting a prescription weight-loss drug, Zepbound, and even shared a brochure from its manufacturer, Eli Lilly. What could have passed as a throwaway comment instead helped loosen a discussion otherwise dominated by sanctions, prisoner lists and political demands.At the time, Belarus was seeking relief from US economic pressure. Lukashenko wanted sanctions eased on key industries and assistance with repairs to his presidential aircraft, which had been delayed by restrictions on parts and servicing.In return, he signalled a willingness to release detainees, a lever his government has long used during periods of diplomatic thaw. Coale later described the approach as distinctly Trumpian: less concerned with optics and more focused on outcomes.The results were tangible. Lukashenko’s government released 123 prisoners in one tranche, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and opposition figure Maria Kalesnikava. Since Trump’s return to office, Belarus has freed more than 250 detainees from over ten countries, among them at least five American citizens. For families who had spent years campaigning for their relatives’ release, the method mattered less than the fact that the prison doors opened.In parallel, Washington eased certain restrictions. Sanctions were lifted on potash, a major Belarusian export central to global fertiliser markets. The US approved software updates and spare parts from Boeing for the state airline Belavia and signalled support for long-delayed repairs to Lukashenko’s jet. US officials also discussed the possibility of arranging access to Zepbound for the Belarusian leader, a detail that underscored just how personal the channel had become.The story has endured not because a drug bought anyone’s release, but because it illustrates a broader truth about how influence can work. Rapport, personality and the unexpected can matter as much as policy papers. In this case, a conversation about weight loss helped soften the ground for an agreement that returned prisoners to their families. It is a reminder that international politics often turns on human moments, and that sometimes the path to freedom begins in the most unlikely places, over dinner, with a simple question and an honest answer.","The episode centres on John P.

"‘Dipu Chandra Das, say his name’: Laura Loomer attacks Islamic hatred after lynching of Hindu man in Bangladesh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dipu-chandra-das-say-his-name-laura-loomer-attacks-islamic-hatred-after-lynching-of-hindu-man-in-bangladesh/articleshow/126178752.cms,"New Video Reveals Final Moments of Hindu Man Dipu Before Lynching in Bangladesh





Right-wing activist Laura Loomer has reacted to the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a 26-year-old Hindu factory worker in Bangladesh. She used the incident to warn about the spread of the Islamist hatred. Her comments followed after Das was lynched by a mob following unverified accusations of blasphemy linked to a workplace dispute.In a post on X, Laura Loomer urged followers to “say his name” and framed the killing as part of what she described as a broader pattern of religiously motivated violence. She argued that Islamist ideology fuels hatred against religious minorities and claimed that such ideas are increasingly being normalised in public discourse.Loomer warned that similar sentiments could spread beyond South Asia and reach Western countries if lawmakers and political leaders fail to confront the issue. Her remarks also criticised prominent media figures, including Tucker Carlson, whom she accused of enabling or downplaying what she sees as the influence of Islamist narratives.Dipu Das was attacked on 20 December in the Bhaluka area of Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district.He was beaten by a group of people after a co-worker accused him of making remarks offensive to Islam, an allegation that has not been substantiated by any court or official investigation.Das, who worked at a garment factory, was the sole breadwinner for his family, which includes his parents, wife, and child. Graphic footage of the attack, filmed by bystanders, spread widely online and triggered outrage among members of the global Hindu community.The killing has renewed attention on the situation of religious minorities in Bangladesh following political upheaval after the removal of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024.Bangladesh’s current leadership under Muhammad Yunus has faced criticism over its response to attacks on Hindus in the country. Critics argue incidents such as Das’s killing have not received adequate international scrutiny.","Right-wing activist Laura Loomer has reacted to the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a 26-year-old Hindu factory worker in Bangladesh.
