Waqf divide in Bihar NDA? Catch-22 situation for BJP and allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-divide-in-bihar-nda-catch-22-situation-for-bjps-allies/articleshow/119547674.cms,"Nagpuriya

NEW DELHI: It's a catch-22 situation for the BJP allies in poll-bound Bihar. The anti-Waqf Amendment Bill protest in Patna on Wednesday set the stage for a fierce political showdown in the state as elections approach. While the RJD and other opposition parties have come out strongly against the proposed Bill claiming that it targets the minorities, the BJP has backed the amendments, saying it will benefit the poor sections of the Muslim community.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board ( AIMPLB ), which is leading the nationwide protests, has alleged that the NDA government at the Centre is trying to seize Waqf properties that were dedicated by their forefathers for the welfare of the people. They claimed that the government is unlawfully attempting to take control of these properties.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav , who is leading the opposition's charge against the ruling NDA in Bihar, joined the AIMPLB protest, accompanied by his father Lalu Prasad. At the protest, Tejashwi asserted that his party would use its full might to oppose the Bill that was ""unconstitutional"", ""dictatorial"" and inspired by the ideology of the RSS (""""). The Congress, the Left parties and the latest entrant in Bihar politics - Prashant Kishor all have opposed the Waqf Bill.However, it is the BJP-led NDA that faces a dilemma on the Waqf issue - which has the potential to polarise the voters of the state. While the BJP is firm in its backing of the amendments, its allies are guarded in their response.Chief minister Nitish Kumar 's JD(U), Union ministers Chirag Paswan's LJP have always found support of minorities in the state in their pockets of influence. These leaders, who are known to hold grand Iftar parties over the years, have already faced the heat over the issue in the form of boycotts from some outfits this year. It will be interesting to see how they position themselves vis-à-vis the Bill amid the opposition's attacks.At today's protest, Tejashwi called Nitish power-hungry. ""There are some who are supporting the Bill because of their greed for power. I am proud that I have in my veins the blood of Lalu ji, who has come here despite his body having been worn down by a kidney transplant and heart surgeries,"" Tejashwi said at the protest site.Interestingly, an ailing Lalu was brought to the protest site perhaps to remind the minorities about the incident when the RJD supremo had famously stopped the Ayodhya Rath Yatra on its tracks by getting BJP patriarch L K Advani arrested in Bihar.The RJD has already dropped enough hints that it will go all out to corner the JD(U) on the issue of Waqf Bill. Last week, the party had put up a poster targeting Nitish Kumar over his stance on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The poster, which was displayed outside the residence of former CM and RJD leader Rabri Devi at 10 Circular Road, Patna, depicted CM Nitish greeting a Muslim cleric. The message on the poster read, "","" accusing Nitish of being a ""cheater"" who forgets his promises. The poster, placed by RJD leader Sanju Kohli, also contained a scathing message: ""I will take your vote but not stand with you on NRC and Waqf Bill with you.""While the JD(U) and Nitish Kumar are yet to clear their stand on the issue, the party has countered RJD's poster attack by releasing a new poster titled 'Bhoolega Nahi Bihar,' (Bihar will not forget). The poster highlights the ""atrocities of the jungle raj"" and carries the message 'Bhoolega Nahi Bihar.'LJP chief Chirag Paswan, who has objected to announcements of boycotts of his Iftaar parties, has blamed the Congress and RJD for the plight of Muslims, claiming that the community was treated as a ""vote bank"" by these parties.Recalling the much talked about political move of his father late Ram Vilas Paswan in 2005, the LJP(RV) president said, ""I shall continue to follow in the footsteps of my father, who had put his own political career at stake by promising his party's support to whoever made a Muslim the chief minister of Bihar"".However, another key NDA ally - Jitan Ram Manjhi targeted the Waqf protesters and used objectionable words for them.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to introduce reforms such as digitization, enhanced audits, improved transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties. The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that Waqf properties are utilized for their intended purposes, benefiting both the Muslim community and the country as a whole.As the election in the state approaches, the attacks and counterattacks over the issue will get more sharp and shrill. The RJD and the Congress will try to maximise their political gains by raising the pitch and putting the NDA allies on the defensive. Any polarisation over the issue may end up helping them and also perhaps the BJP, which has already made massive gains in the state.","The anti-Waqf Amendment Bill protest in Patna on Wednesday set the stage for a fierce political showdown in the state as elections approach.

Kamra’s response

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Police have issued a second summons to stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra , asking him to appear for questioning over his joke referring to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor) in his latest stand-up video, ""Naya Bharat,"" on YouTube, officials said on Wednesday.Kamra missed the first summons after his lawyer requested seven days, prompting police to issue a second notice following legal consultation. Police are also probing whether Kamra has previously made satirical comments about other politicians, actors, or public figures.""If the investigation reveals that Kunal Kamra has committed any crime through his pranks, more cases can be registered against him,"" police officials said, adding that while his lawyer is in touch, Kamra himself has not communicated with investigators.Kamra’s ""gaddar"" remark has sparked outrage, with several political leaders demanding action. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis condemned Kamra’s statements, declaring in the Assembly, ""We accept political satire , but we do not accept freedom of expression if it leads to tyranny.""Fadnavis also criticized Kamra’s performance, calling it ""low-quality comedy"" aimed at gaining attention. ""This artist targets the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice to stir controversy,"" he said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar backed Fadnavis, saying, ""Action will be taken as per the law.""On Tuesday, Kamra posted a video mocking Shiv Sena workers for vandalizing The Habitat comedy club in Mumbai, where he had previously performed.The controversy continues to escalate as Kamra faces mounting legal scrutiny and political pressure over his satirical remarks.","Mumbai Police have issued a second summons to stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra.

Punjab Police’s stand

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has called for a transparent and time-bound investigation into the alleged assault of Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath by Punjab Police personnel in Patiala.Stressing the need for accountability, senior Army officials said those responsible should face strict legal action to maintain trust between the military and civil administration, according to the news agency PTI.Following the incident, Colonel Bath has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court, requesting that the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or another independent agency.He argued that an impartial probe under the Punjab Police was unlikely.The Army has vowed to pursue the case until justice is served. “A fair and honest investigation must be conducted in a transparent and time-bound manner to ensure the guilty are punished,” said Lt Gen Mohit Wadhwa , Chief of Staff, Army Western Command.Punjab director general of police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav reaffirmed the force’s respect for the Army, assuring that those responsible would be held accountable. “Anyone found guilty of assaulting a serving Army officer will face strict legal action,” he said.To ensure a thorough probe, Punjab Police has suspended 12 personnel and set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by a senior officer. The SIT has been instructed to expedite its investigation, according to ANI.According to Col. Bath’s complaint, he and his son were attacked by Punjab Police officers outside a dhaba in Patiala on the night of March 13-14. The Army was informed the next day, and Col. Bath was transferred from a civil hospital to the Command Hospital in Chandimandir for further treatment.On March 22, the Civil Lines police station in Patiala registered an FIR against the officers named in the complaint. The implicated personnel were immediately suspended and transferred out of Patiala.Lt. Gen. Wadhwa further said that the Army had taken up the issue with Punjab’s top administration. “We have engaged at the highest levels to ensure prompt investigation and justice,” he said.DGP Yadav urged the public not to view the case as an Army-versus-Police conflict. “The Army and Punjab Police remain united in their commitment to national security and justice,” he asserted.The SIT will work on a daily basis to ensure the case is investigated efficiently, officials confirmed.","Indian Army demands swift probe into alleged assault of Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath.

What Supreme Court said:



The top court said: ""In normal circumstances, we are slow in granting stay at this stage. But since the observations in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 are totally unknown to canons of law and depict total insensitive and inhuman approach, we are inclined to stay the said observations.""

Referring to the high court's observations, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""This is one judgement I take a very serious exception.""

""It is a very serious matter,"" Justice Gavai said, ""exhibiting total insensitiveness on the part of the judge.""

""We are sorry to use such harsh words against the judge,"" the bench added.

""We have perused the order (of the high court). We are at pains to say that some of the observations made in the impugned order and particularly in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 depicts a total lack of sensitivity on the part of the author of the judgement,"" the bench added.

""The registrar general is forthwith communate the order and place before honourable chief justice of Allahabad HC and take such matter as deemed appropriate,"" it added, according to news agency PTI.

The Allahabad HC's ruling



Family relieved after Supreme Court order

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Allahabad high court 's controversial order, which stated that ""grabbing the breast and breaking the pyjama string"" were not sufficient grounds to charge an accused with rape or attempted rape.During the hearing, a bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and AG Masih criticised the high court judge for displaying ""total insensitivity"" in handling the case.The apex court remarked that while it regretted using harsh words for the judge, the matter was serious, and the order was not issued impulsively.A few days ago, the high court passed an order in connection with a case involving two men, Pawan and Akash, who allegedly grabbed the minor’s breasts, tore her pyjama string, and attempted to drag her under a culvert while she was walking with her mother.Initially, they were charged under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. However, the Allahabad HC ruled that their actions did not qualify as rape or an attempt to rape but instead fell under the lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault , punishable under Section 354(B) IPC and Section 9(m) of the POCSO Act.The high court’s ruling was based on the argument that ""an attempt to commit rape must go beyond the stage of preparation and actual attempt to commit an offence consists chiefly in the greater degree of determination.""""The specific allegation against Akash is that he tried to drag the victim beneath the culvert and broke the string of her pyjama. It is also not stated by witnesses that due to this act of the accused the victim got naked or got undressed. There is no allegation that accused tried to commit penetrative sexual assault against the victim,"" the court observed in its order.In view of this, the court opined that the allegations levelled against the accused and facts of the case hardly constituted an offence of attempt to rape in the case. Victim's family relieved after SC order.The family of the minor girl, who was the victim of an attempted rape in Kasganj district, has expressed relief after the Supreme Court stayed the high court's ruling in the case.Advocate Rachna Tyagi, who represented the family in the apex court, shared the update, stating that the survivor's mother is ""extremely relieved."" Meanwhile, the government advocate representing the survivor in the Allahabad High Court was unavailable for comment.Speaking to PTI, Tyagi said, ""The survivor's mother is extremely relieved because ever since the incident in November 2021, her FIR was not being registered. In January 2022, she had to approach the district court under Section 156(3) to file a complaint.""""Since then, for over three-and-a-half years, neither the trial court nor the high court ordered the FIR to be registered. Attempted rape is a cognisable offence and an FIR must be filed in such cases,"" she added.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Allahabad high court's controversial order.

According to media reports, only battlefield fighters could be recognised as valiant freedom fighters, while others could be classified as ‘Liberation War Associates’.Kolkatans with ancestral links to Bangladesh or professional experience across the border have a nuanced approach towards the deliberation. The definition of muktijoddhas has been altered over 10 times by now.“During the Awami League’s tenure, many fake freedom fighters were enlisted. Communist and Leftist freedom fighters did not receive recognition. The National Freedom Fighters’ Council even decided to revoke Ziaur Rahman’s ‘Bir Uttam’ title in 2021,” said Arka Bhaduri, an independent journalist who has been writing on contemporary Bangladesh affairs.“Amid numerous fake claims of being muktijoddhas, there have been instances of genuine people being ignored and not granted this recognition as many were reluctant to publicise their contributions,” said Abhijit Dasgupta, director of ‘Invincible Bravura’ on the Indian Navy’s formation of the first ‘Nau Commando’ that included eight Bengali escapees from a Pakistani submarine in 1971 during the war.Dasgupta called the amendment “after so many decades” an attempt to “deliberately confuse the contemporary youth”. Bhaduri believes all those who participated in the struggle are “freedom fighters”. “Mujib’s role in the post-1971 era was problematic, but it is undeniable that although he did not physically participate in combat, the war was fought in his name. Calling him or Tajuddin Ahmad mere supporters would be a distortion of history,” he said.Cultural activist Subha Prasad Nandi Majumdar, who is from a refugee family of 1947, described it as a “ploy to subvert the real essence of liberation struggle”.", deliberations are on to modify the definition of ‘bir muktijoddha (valiant freedom fighter)’ Kolkatans with ancestral links to Bangladesh or professional experience across the border have a nuanced approach towards the deliberation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119563382,imgsize-969744,width-400,resizemode-4/119563382.jpg"

In a Facebook post, which she initially deleted but later reposted, she spoke out against deep-seated colour and gender biases in society.The comment likened her administration to the colour black, while her predecessor and husband V Venu’s was called “white”. Without naming the person behind the remark, Muraleedharan hinted at sexism in the criticism but refused to let the insult define her.“I think it’s high time for me not to feel defensive about either the fact that I am a woman or that I am dark,” she said, according to news agency ANI. “It’s time that I own both of these and that I come out strongly. Maybe it will help those people who are going through similar feelings of insecurity and inadequacy to feel that we are worth it and we don’t need external validation.”The IAS officer, the first woman to hold the state’s top bureaucratic post, has made a career out of breaking barriers. Her message was clear: She’s not backing down.Taking to Facebook, she addressed the cultural fixation with fairness and shared a childhood memory of struggling with it. “As a four-year-old, I asked my mother whether she could put me back in her womb and bring me out again, all white and pretty,” she wrote.That perspective changed over time, thanks to her children, she said. “That black is beautiful. That black is gorgeousness. That I dig black.”Muraleedharan dismissed the remark as possibly meant in jest but called out the deeper implication.“Behind the humour, there is an entire value connotation that black is not good, that there is something wrong with it,” she told ANI. “What is wrong about black? Isn’t it more a perception than a reality? It is important to claim blackness as something worthwhile and beautiful.”Muraleedharan said beauty is not a singular thing. “The very fact of looking for a particular standard of beauty is problematic because ultimately beauty is not a single thing, it's multiple things. We should all enjoy every kind of beauty,” she said.Her response sparked a wave of support across political lines. Opposition leader VD Satheesan of Congress called her words “alarming” proof that even a high-ranking official isn’t immune to discrimination. “Even a senior IAS officer at her level expressed such thoughts, which is alarming,” Satheesan said, emphasising that biases — both overt and subtle — continue to shape perceptions.State education minister V Sivankutty of CPM praised Muraleedharan’s stand as “courageous”, adding that discrimination based on skin colour has no place in the state.","Sarada Muraleedharan is the first woman to hold the state’s top bureaucratic post.

Parliament is not beyond the law, says HC



Rashid's counsel counters NIA's objections



Rashid's terror funding case



NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that both the court and the Lok Sabha Speaker are fully capable of ensuring that Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh , also known as Engineer Rashid, currently jailed in a terror funding case , abides by the law while attending Parliament.The court later reserved its order on Rashid's plea to participate in the ongoing session.Discounting the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) concerns over losing control of the accused within Parliament premises, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said, ""Let’s not see ghosts. Let’s not feel so powerless that ‘oh my God, inside Parliament he will do this or that.’ He will be in our custody. Our arms are long enough and strong enough to keep him in line.""After hearing submissions from both the NIA and Rashid’s counsel, a bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Bhambhani stated that a detailed order would be passed soon.The court suggested that the NIA’s apprehensions could be addressed by imposing stringent conditions on Rashid if he is permitted to attend the session, which runs until April 4. Rashid’s counsel clarified that his plea was not for custody parole but for permission to attend the House while remaining in custody. He assured the court that Rashid would strictly comply with any conditions imposed.The court specified that the Speaker and the secretary general of the Lok Sabha possess sufficient authority to maintain discipline inside Parliament.""We are not granting him bail. He is in custody, and our officers will be with him at all times, except where they are not allowed. He will be in the highest temple of democracy—inside Parliament. Do not undermine the power of the Speaker and the Secretary General to enforce discipline,"" Justice Bhambhani said.In response to the NIA’s insistence on Rashid’s role in the case, the bench assured, ""We do not for a moment undermine the seriousness of the allegations. National security is paramount.""The court also suggested allowing a prison or police official in plain clothes to accompany Rashid inside Parliament if necessary.Facing strong opposition from the NIA, Rashid’s counsel argued that the Parliament’s marshals would maintain strict control over his actions.""The moment he switches on his mic to say anything inappropriate, his mic will be taken away, and he will be thrown out,"" Rashid’s lawyer said.To this, Justice Singh said, ""Then it will become a national issue that his mic has been taken away and he has been thrown out by the marshals.""Rashid’s counsel also informed the court of plans to challenge a March 19 trial court order denying him regular bail.Rashid, an Independent MP from Baramulla who defeated Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, is facing trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in a 2017 terror funding case. He was arrested by the NIA in 2019 and has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail since.The NIA’s case against Rashid stems from allegations that he financially aided separatists and terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.His name surfaced during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali, a co-accused in the case. A special NIA court framed charges against Rashid in 2022 under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy, sedition, and waging war against the government, along with UAPA provisions for terror funding.The Baramulla MP was previously granted interim bail for a month in September 2023 to campaign for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.The high court has now asked the NIA to suggest additional conditions that could be imposed if Rashid is allowed to attend Parliament, reserving its final decision.",Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh is currently jailed in a terror funding case.

Britain's Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has stepped down as patron of Sentebale, the charity he co-founded nearly two decades ago, citing a ""devastating"" breakdown in relations within the organisation. The decision, announced late Tuesday, marks another setback for the Duke of Sussex, who has been living in self-imposed exile since stepping back from royal duties in 2020.Harry and his co-founder, Lesotho's Prince Seeiso, confirmed their resignations in a joint statement, attributing their departure to an irreparable rift between the charity's board of trustees and chair Sophie Chandauka, who was appointed in 2023.""With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same,"" their statement read. ""It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.""Sentebale, established in 2006 in honor of Princess Diana, was created to support young people affected by HIV and AIDS in Lesotho and later expanded to Botswana. Harry had previously pledged to remain committed to the charity even after his departure from the British royal family, telling supporters in 2020, ""We're not walking away, and we certainly aren't walking away from you.""However, tensions within the organisation escalated as trustees reportedly requested Chandauka's resignation, leading to an internal dispute. Chandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer, alleged she had been targeted after raising concerns about governance issues within the charity, including claims of harassment, misogyny, and racism.In a statement, Chandauka described the situation as ""the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the coverup that ensued.""She also confirmed that she had reported trustees to the UK's Charity Commission and taken legal action in the High Court in London. Sentebale, in response, said it had not yet received Harry and Seeiso's resignations but acknowledged an ongoing ""recalibration of the board.""The UK's Charity Commission confirmed it was ""aware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale"" and was assessing the situation to determine appropriate steps.In December, the charity announced plans to transition into a ""locally led organisation"" with a stronger focus on youth health, economic stability, and climate resilience in Southern Africa. As part of this shift, Sentebale relocated its leadership positions from London to Johannesburg.Harry and Seeiso claimed Chandauka had ""sued the charity"" in an effort to retain her position after trustees requested her resignation. They also signaled their intent to share their concerns with the Charity Commission.For Harry, the resignation is significant, as Sentebale was one of the few private patronages he retained after being stripped of his royal and military titles in 2020. The charity's name, meaning ""forget me not"" in Sesotho, was chosen as a tribute to Princess Diana and also serves as a farewell phrase—now carrying an added layer of symbolism in light of recent events.","Duke of Sussex steps down as patron of Sentebale, the charity he co-founded.

US President Donald Trump expressed optimism about his working relationship with Jeff Bezos and the future of The Washington Post , alleging that Bezos privately criticised the newspaper's staff.In an interview with OutKick's Clay Travis, Trump claimed Bezos lamented the financial losses from running the publication and voiced frustrations about its newsroom employees.""They actually did a couple of bad articles on him,"" Trump said. ""He said, 'This is crazy, I lose my fortune running this thing and they're out of control.

In a February post on X, he said that the publication would focus on defending ""two pillars: personal liberties and free markets."" He emphasised that while other viewpoints would still be represented, the Post's editorial direction would strongly support those values.""I'm confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America,"" Bezos wrote. ""I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion.""Bezos has previously clashed with the newspaper's staff, most notably last year when he blocked a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris shortly before the election.Trump praised the recent shifts at the Post, calling them ""great,"" and said he discussed the changes directly with Bezos. He also noted that Bezos has been on the receiving end of negative press, furthering his belief that the billionaire is ""really trying to be more fair.""Reflecting on his evolving political support, Trump pointed to Bezos' attendance at his inauguration as an example of how attitudes toward him have shifted.

The women, between the fertilization and all of the other things that we're talking about, it's going to be great.""After audience laughter, he embraced the title, stating he preferred it to other names he had received.Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump consistently referred to himself as the ""father of IVF"".

In February, he signed an executive order requesting policy recommendations for IVF access protection and cost reduction.Democratic Vice President nominee Kamala Harris criticised Trump's self-proclaimed title, highlighting the impact of abortion bans in various states and the risks to IVF treatments.

Lack of mental health support. Societal pressures. Poor communication. Emotional instability.

ROHTAK: The body of a yoga teacher missing for three months from Rohtak was on Tuesday found buried more than 7-foot deep in Charkhi Dadri district in a case of murder stemming from jealousy and revenge .Jagdeep (45), a teacher at Baba Mastnath University in Rohtak, was living in rented accommodation in Janata Colony for three years. According to police, the main accused, Rajkaran (40), suspected Jagdeep of having an illicit relationship with his wife. When he discovered a photo of his wife on Jagdeep's phone, he allegedly conspired to eliminate him.On Dec 24, 2024, Jagdeep went missing. His uncle Ishwar, a resident of Mandothi village in Jhajjar, filed a missing person's report on Feb 3 at the Shivaji Colony police station. Despite multiple search efforts by family and police, no clues initially surfaced.Investigations began at the university, checking CCTV footage and speaking to colleagues, but Jagdeep's whereabouts remained unknown. A breakthrough came when police reviewed surveillance footage from Janata Colony and its surrounding areas. CCTV footage showed four men forcibly abducting Jagdeep from his rented home, with his hands and feet tied, and loading him into a vehicle.Further investigation using mobile dump data led the police to Pentaawas Kalan village in Charkhi Dadri. Based on this, two suspects – Dharmpal and Hardeep – were taken into custody. During interrogation, they confessed to the kidnapping and murder.The suspects revealed that they took Jagdeep to a remote spot in Paintawas Kalan, where he was buried alive in a deep pit. Acting on this information, a police team led by ASP Shashi Shekhar, along with CIA, FSL teams, and local police under the supervision of IPS officer Divyanshi Singla, arrived at the scene and began excavation in the presence of Jagdeep's family.Despite knowing the exact location, it took hours to retrieve the body due to the depth and compactness of the soil. Eventually, under torchlight, the team managed to dig deep enough to tie a rope and pull out the body.According to CIA-1 in-charge Kuldeep, Jagdeep rented the accommodation in the house of Rajkaran's in-laws. His wife, who often visited from her parental home in Pentaawas Kalan, allegedly developed a relationship with Jagdeep.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday called US President Donald Trump's auto tariffs a ""direct attack"" on Canada and said that the trade war is hurting Americans. He also highlighted the adverse effects of the trade dispute on Americans, evidenced by diminishing consumer confidence.Trump on Wednesday announced 25 per cent tariffs on automobile imports, declaring ""this is permanent"".""This is a very direct attack. We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,"" Carney responded.Carney indicated he need a detailed information about Trump's executive order before implementing countermeasures.He described the action as unwarranted and plans to suspend his election campaign to chair a special Cabinet committee on US relations in Ottawa on Thursday.Carney described the latest round of tariffs as both ""unjustified"" and ""inconsistent"" with the established Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement on trade.He emphasised that Canada needs to enhance its self-reliance and diversify its market presence to better protect itself from such actions.""This will hurt us but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger,"" Carney said.""Canadian workers, Canadians as a whole across this country have gotten over the shock of the betrayal. And are learning lessons. We have to look out for ourselves, and we have to look out for each other and work together for each other.""Trump had previously allowed a one-month exemption for Mexican and Canadian automotive imports but than on Wednesday he announced that the US will impose a 25% tariff on imported autos, a move expected to further strain relations with key trading partners just days before additional levies are set to take effect.""All cars that are not made in the United States will face a 25% tariff,"" Trump said at the White House. ""If they're made here, there will be absolutely no tariff.""The new measure, set to begin on April 2, will apply to foreign-made cars and light trucks, adding to the existing duties already placed on these goods. The decision follows a series of trade actions from the Trump administration, including tariffs on imports from major economic partners such as Canada, Mexico, and China, along with a 25% duty on steel and aluminum.Trump previously imposed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, threatening comprehensive tariffs on all Canadian goods and other trading partners by April 2.""He (Trump) wants to break us so America can own us.

Who is Rumeysa Ozturk?



A Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University was detained on Tuesday by the federal immigration agents over her pro-Palestinian activism .In a surveillance video, six immigration agents could be seen in plain clothes and had covered their faces with masks when they came to detain student Rumeysa Ozturk . The officers could be seen taking away Ozturk's phone as she yelled and was handcuffed.Rumeysa Ozturk's lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai on Wednesday said that Ozturk was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan.In the video, the agents could be heard saying, ""We're the police,"" A man is heard on camera saying, ""Why are you hiding your faces?""""We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of, Khanbabai said in a statement.Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.The transfer of Ozturk, a PhD student at Tufts University, appeared to violate a federal court order from Tuesday, which directed the department of homeland security (DHS) and Ice to give the court 48 hours’ notice before attempting to take her out of Massachusetts.Following the discovery of Ozturk's Louisiana transfer via the online locator, the federal judge mandated DHS and Ice to address an emergency request by 9am ET on Thursday to produce Ozturk in court.A DHS representative stated to the Guardian on Wednesday that Ozturk had received ""the privilege to be in this country on a visa"" and alleged, without evidence, her support for Hamas, which governs Gaza and initiated the attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023, triggering Israel's military response.""DHS and Ice investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,"" the DHS spokesperson told the Guardian. ""A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security.""Reuters reports suggest officials may have already cancelled Ozturk's student visa. Tufts University President Sunil Kumar confirmed the institution's non-involvement, stating they ""had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event"". Ozturk, from Turkey, studies philosophy and holds a Fulbright scholarship.Earlier this month, DHS agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, who helped organise the pro-Palestinian movement at the school and than a South Korean American student Yunseo Chung.At age 30, Ozturk holds a Fulbright Scholarship and is pursuing her doctorate in Child Study and Human Development at Tufts, with previous academic experience at Columbia University in New York, as indicated on her LinkedIn profile.In the previous year, she jointly wrote an opinion piece for the Tufts Daily, the university's student publication, expressing criticism of the institution's handling of student demands regarding divestment from Israel-linked companies and their request to ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.""Currently residing in the United States on an F-1 student visa, as confirmed by her legal representative Khanbabai, Ozturk was apprehended while proceeding to join companions for breaking her Ramadan fast.""Based on patterns we are seeing across the country, her exercising her free speech rights appear to have played a role in her detention,"" Khanbabai says.","Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was detained on Tuesday by the federal immigration agents over her pro-Palestinian activism. In a surveillance video, six immigration agents could be seen in plain clothes and had covered their faces with masks when they came to detain the student. The officers could been seen taking away Oz Turk's phone as she yelled and was handcuffed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119565787,imgsize-3284966,width-400,resizemode-4/119565787.jpg"
World's largest 'baby exporter' admits to adoption fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-largest-baby-exporter-admits-to-adoption-fraud/articleshow/119564430.cms,"SEOUL: South Korea on Wednesday admitted for the first time that in its rush to send children to American and European homes decades ago, its adoption agencies committed widespread malpractices, including falsifying documents, to make them more adoptable.The findings by South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government agency, which said children were sent away ""like luggage"" for profit decades ago, were a hard-won victory for South Korean adoptees abroad. Many adoptees have returned to their birth country in recent years, campaigning tirelessly for South Korea to come to terms with one of the most shameful legacies of its modern history.Adoption agencies falsified documents to present babies as orphans when they had known parents, the commission acknowledged. When some babies died before they were flown overseas, other babies were sent in their names. The heads of four private adoption agencies were given the power to become legal guardians for the children, signing them away for overseas adoption.The commission's report was the government's first official admission of problems with the country's adoption practices, including the lack of oversight, even though such malpractice had been exposed in the past. The agency recommended that the state apologize for violating the rights of South Korean adoptees.South Korea is the source of the world's largest diaspora of intercountry adoptees, with around 200,000 South Korean children sent abroad since the end of the Korean War in 1953, mostly to the United States and Europe.In its destitute postwar decades, South Korea promoted overseas adoptions to find homes for orphaned, abandoned or disabled children abroad rather than build a welfare system for them at home. The government left it to the adoption agencies to find and ship children abroad for fees from adoptive families.""This is a moment we have fought to achieve: The commission's decision acknowledges what we adoptees have known for so long -- that the deceit, fraud and issues within the Korean adoption process cannot remain hidden,"" said Peter Moller, a South Korean adoptee from Denmark who led an international campaign for the commission to launch an investigation.The truth commission does not have the power to prosecute any of the adoption agencies, but the government is required by law to follow its recommendations.The adoption agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Adoption agencies falsified documents to present babies as orphans when they had known parents.

"Citing India, Trump calls for election reform in US through executive order",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/citing-india-trump-calls-for-election-reform-in-us-through-executive-order/articleshow/119546162.cms,"US president Donald Trump

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Approvingly citing the conduct of elections in India among other countries, President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued an executive order aimed at reforming the election process in America, including a requirement for voters to prove they are US citizens when they register to vote.""Despite pioneering self-government, the United States now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing. India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the US largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,"" Trump said in the order widely seen as a federal executive overreach that is certain to be challenged in courts.The US Constitution delegates power to regulate the “time, place and manner” of elections to states, with the proviso that Congress -- and not the President -- can step in and override those laws. As a result, each state has its own set of rules and regulations for elections.Although only citizens can vote in federal elections, some states require voters to provide proof of citizenship to vote, while others require voters to only sign statements swearing they are citizens. Noncitizens who sign such statements can be charged with crimes and deported. Each state, and sometimes even counties, also have their own rules pertaining to early voting, mail-in and absentee ballots, and counting procedures and schedules, all of which results in a disjointed and incohesive process.While Trump has alleged that the sketchy conduct resulted in the ""stolen election"" of 2020 -- which he claims he won -- critics say his effort at election reform is aimed at disenfranchising legitimate immigrant and minority voters to ensure Republican primacy that is being challenged by the demographic changes in American. Trump and his allies in turn allege that Democrats are bringing in hordes of illegal immigrants and registering them to vote in order to perpetuate a Democratic party rule.Elon Musk is among them. ""The goal of the Biden administration was to strategically place illegals in swing states and make their status legal, thereby turning swing states Democrat. The net result would have been permanent one-party rule of the USA, just like what they did in California,"" the South Africa-born billionaire alleged recently even though Trump acolytes have been unable to prove the charge despite strenuous efforts, ferreting out only a negligible number of bogus voting cases.While Trump embraced India's biometric push in terms of voter ID, when it come to counting though, he cited Germany and Canada's use of paper ballots, tallied in public by local officials, which he said ""substantially reduces the number of disputes as compared to the American patchwork of voting methods that can lead to basic chain-of-custody problems.""Further, while countries like Denmark and Sweden ""sensibly"" limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day, the EO says, while barring states from counting mail ballots received after Election Day. Currently, 18 states count mail ballots that arrive later so long as they are postmarked by Election Day.Trump pledged to withhold federal election funding from states that do not comply with the raft of directives included in his order, saying, “Election fraud — you’ve heard the term — we’ll end it, hopefully.""",US President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at reforming the election process in America.

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he might give a little relaxation on tariffs to China to secure Beijing's approval for TikTok's sale.While talking to reporters at the White House, Trump said, ""Maybe I give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done.""Trump said that he will have a form of deal on TikTok with China and added that if it weren't done in time, he would extend the deadline, which was scheduled for April 5. ""China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval and I think they'll do that.""The fate of TikTok turned black in US after the US law ordered the application to separate from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a ban, due to concerns that Beijing could utilise the platform for surveillance or influence operations targeting Americans.The legislation became effective on January 19, prior to Trump's inauguration, though he subsequently issued a postponement allowing continued operations.Trump previously attempted to prohibit TikTok's US operations during his first presidential term, citing national security risks.In January, TikTok briefly ceased US operations and was removed from application stores as the deadline approached, affecting millions of users.Following his second term commencement on January 20, Trump suspended the ban's implementation for 75 days whilst seeking resolution with Beijing.TikTok resumed US services and returned to Apple and Google platforms in February.AI company Perplexity has recently declared its interest in acquiring TikTok.The company outlined plans to combine its AI search technology with TikTok's video-sharing platform in a blog post.""Combining Perplexity's answer engine with TikTok's extensive video library would allow us to build the best search experience in the world,"" the San Francisco-based organisation explained.While TikTok appears hesitant about selling, potential buyers include ""The People's Bid for TikTok,"" initiated by Frank McCourt's Project Liberty.Additional interested parties include Microsoft, Oracle and a group featuring Internet content creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson).",US President Donald Trump said he might give a little relaxation on tariffs to China to secure Beijing's approval for TikTok's sale.

""They approach her and start grabbing her with their faces covered. They're covering their faces.

Ayanna Pressley called the arrest ""a horrifying violation of Rumeysa's constitutional rights to due process and free speech.""""She must be immediately released,"" Pressley said in a statement. ""We won't stand by while the Trump Administration continues to abduct students with legal status and attack our fundamental freedoms.""Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell called the video ""disturbing.""""Based on what we now know, it is alarming that the federal administration chose to ambush and detain her, apparently targeting a law-abiding individual because of her political views,"" she said. ""This isn't public safety, it's intimidation that will, and should, be closely scrutinized in court.""U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice.But as of Wednesday evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement's online detainee locater system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana.A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ozturk's detention and the termination of her visa.""DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security,"" the spokesperson told the AP.'She's never spoken badly to anyone' Ozturk was one of four students last March who co-authored an op-ed piece in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university's response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,"" disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.Friends said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the op-ed was published, her name, photograph and work history were featured by Canary Mission , a website that says it documents people who ""promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses."" The op-ed was the only cited example of ""anti-Israel activism"" by Ozturk.Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. President Donald Trump 's administration has cited a seldom-invoked legal statute that authorizes the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests.Hundreds of people rallied in a Somerville park to support Ozturk on Wednesday, with speaker after speaker demanding her release and accusing both major political parties of failing to protect immigrants and stand up for Palestinians.""Free Rumeysa Ozturk now,"" the crowd chanted, along with traditional protest slogans such as ""Free, free Palestine."" Many held Palestinian flags and homemade signs supporting her and opposing ICE.Before attending Tufts, Ozturk graduated with a master's degree from the Developmental Psychology program at Teachers College at Columbia University in New York, according to an alumni spotlight article in 2021.Reyyan Bilge , a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ozturk as a ""soft spoken, kind and gentle soul"" who is deeply focused on her research and not closely involved in the campus protests.The two first met at Istanbul Sehir University, where Bilge supervised her thesis, before working together on cognitive research and co-publishing papers.

Court split on ruling

Administration faces scrutiny

A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to lift an order barring US President Donald Trump's administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a rarely invoked wartime law.In a 2-1 decision, the US court of appeals for the district of Columbia circuit refused to overturn a March 15 order that temporarily blocks deportations under the controversial law. The administration had justified the expulsions by labeling the Tren de Aragua gang an ""invading force"" under a presidential proclamation.The justice department appealed after US district judge James Boasberg blocked further deportations and ordered that planeloads of Venezuelan migrants already removed be returned to the US. However, the administration did not comply with that order.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, arguing that the government's actions violated due process.The case has deepened tensions between the White House and the federal judiciary, particularly as Boasberg's decision challenges the administration’s broad use of executive authority in immigration enforcement.Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Patricia Millett sided against lifting the order, with each writing separate concurring opinions. Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, dissented.Millett, an Obama-era nominee, defended Boasberg's decision, emphasising that the ruling simply preserves the current situation while critical legal questions are examined in the upcoming hearing.""There is neither jurisdiction nor reason for this court to interfere at this very preliminary stage or to allow the government to singlehandedly moot the plaintiffs’ claims by immediately removing them beyond the reach of their lawyers or the court,"" Millett wrote.Henderson, a nominee of President George H W Bush, added that the ruling does not prevent the administration from detaining migrants but ensures they are not sent to a country they have no ties to.""Lifting the injunctions risks exiling plaintiffs to a land that is not their country of origin,"" she wrote. ""Indeed, at oral argument before this Court, the government in no uncertain terms conveyed that—were the injunction lifted—it would immediately begin deporting plaintiffs without notice.""In dissent, Walker argued that the lawsuit belongs in Texas, where the plaintiffs are detained, and warned that blocking deportations could harm sensitive foreign policy negotiations.""The government has also shown that the district court's orders threaten irreparable harm to delicate negotiations with foreign powers on matters concerning national security,"" he said.Judge Boasberg, chief of the federal district court in Washington, has indicated he will determine whether the administration defied his order by proceeding with deportations. The White House has cited ""state secrets privilege"" to withhold further details on the matter.Trump and his allies have intensified their attacks on Boasberg, with some calling for his impeachment. However, in a rare statement, chief justice John Roberts defended judicial independence , asserting that ""impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""The Alien Enemies Act, which allows for deportations without a court hearing, has not been used since World War II. Boasberg ruled that migrants must have an opportunity to challenge their alleged gang affiliations before being removed, arguing there is a ""strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.""The ruling marks a significant legal hurdle for the Trump administration's immigration policies, adding another layer of complexity to the debate over executive power and due process rights for noncitizens.","Appeals court won't lift order barring deportations under wartime law.

James Boasberg back in Donald Trump's crosshairs as he takes on Signal chat leak case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/james-boasberg-back-in-donald-trumps-crosshairs-as-he-takes-on-signal-chat-leak-case/articleshow/119556219.cms,"File photo of James Boasberg (Pic credit: AP)

A newly filed lawsuit targeting US President Donald Trump's administration over leaked Pentagon plans in a Signal chat has been assigned to Judge James Boasberg , the same judge who previously halted the administration's deportation policies.The watchdog group American Oversight filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, accusing defense secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials of violating federal records laws by discussing military plans concerning Houthi attacks in a Signal group chat. The case has been randomly assigned to Boasberg, a judge serving on the US district court for Washington, DC.Republican lawmakers have strongly criticised Boasberg's involvement in the case. Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo, condemned what he described as ""rogue judges"" like Boasberg, saying that he has introduced legislation aimed at preventing district-level judges from issuing nationwide injunctions similar to the one Boasberg previously used to block deportations.""These judges have shown they care more about obstructing President Trump's policies than applying the law correctly,"" Hawley said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Congress has the power to change that.""Representative Darrell Issa, R-Calif, also called for Boasberg to recuse himself, arguing that the judge's alleged bias against Trump is clear.""It is no coincidence that Judge Boasberg has been assigned this case,"" Issa said. ""While I do not expect him to step aside, doing so would be the best course of action to maintain the court’s integrity.""American Oversight argues that the lawsuit revolves around the Federal Records Act , which mandates that federal officials preserve communications related to official government business. The group highlighted that agencies typically ensure message retention from apps like Signal through policies requiring messages to be forwarded to official systems or archived appropriately.The lawsuit names several high-ranking officials as defendants, including Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe, treasury secretary Scott Bessent, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and the national archives and records administration. It also raises concerns that Signal's auto-delete feature may have resulted in the destruction of important records in violation of federal law.Former federal prosecutor Andrew Cherkasky warned that assigning the case to Boasberg is legally contentious and could damage the credibility of the DC district court for years.""With his past controversial rulings under appellate review, allowing him to handle another case involving Trump's policies could be problematic,"" Cherkasky told Fox News Digital.Former Trump attorney Alina Habba also criticised the lawsuit, calling it an example of political bias in the judiciary.""This is yet another attempt to weaponise the judicial system against Trump's administration,"" Habba said. ""Such tactics distract from the real achievements of this administration, especially in safeguarding national security.""The White House has pushed back against allegations that the Signal group chat was used for ""war planning,"" as some reports have suggested. Gabbard, during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday, maintained that no classified information was shared in the chat.“It was an error that a reporter was mistakenly added to a Signal chat involving senior national security officials discussing imminent strikes on the Houthis,” Gabbard said. “The National Security Advisor has taken full responsibility, and the National Security Council is conducting a thorough review to determine how this happened.”","Watchdog group American Oversight filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, accusing defense secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials of violating federal records laws.

Uncertain circumstances surrounding the incident

Four US army soldiers were found dead in Lithuania after disappearing during a training exercise near the border with Belarus, NATO secretary general Mark Rutte confirmed on Wednesday.The soldiers, assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, Georgia, were last seen on Tuesday operating an armored vehicle as part of a tactical exercise near Pabrade, an area approximately six miles from the Belarusian border.“This is tragic news, and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of these brave soldiers,” Rutte said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland. “At this stage, details remain unclear.”The US army has yet to issue an official statement regarding the circumstances of their deaths. However, prior to the tragic discovery, the Army had expressed gratitude to Lithuanian forces for their assistance in the search-and-rescue efforts.“I would like to personally thank the Lithuanian Armed Forces and first responders who quickly came to our aid,” Lt general Charles Costanza, V Corps commanding general, said in a statement. “This teamwork underscores the strength of our partnership, regardless of the flags we wear on our shoulders.”The missing soldiers were reportedly traveling in an M88A2 Armored Recovery Vehicle when they vanished around 7 pm local time on Tuesday, according to Lithuanian media. A large-scale search operation was launched, involving Lithuanian troops, Nato forces, Lithuanian Air Force helicopters, and the country’s State Border Guard Service.By Wednesday, Lithuanian officials had identified a probable location of the incident. “The possible location of the incident has been identified, and search and rescue is underway,” Lithuanian military spokesman Major Gintautas Ciunis said.While the exact cause of the soldiers’ deaths remains unknown, Lithuanian military officials have refrained from speculation. “Such incidents, while rare, do occur during large-scale military exercises,” said Giedrimas Jeglinskas, chairman of Lithuania’s National Security and Defense Committee. “Lessons will be learned, and safety measures will be reinforced.”","Four US army soldiers were found dead in Lithuania after disappearing during a training exercise near the border with Belarus.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws. The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119484911,imgsize-825613,width-400,resizemode-4/119484911.jpg"

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

A US bipartisan bill introduced on Monday urged the release of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan labeling him a "" political prisoner ,"" and proposed sanctions on the Army chief, General Asim Munir, over alleged ""persecution of political opponents.""According to The Hill, Representatives Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) and Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) introduced the "" Pakistan Democracy Act ,"" which advocates for targeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.""Khan is clearly a political prisoner,"" Rep.

He has also urged President Donald Trump, through a letter, to ""put pressure on Pakistan’s military leadership including through visa bans, to restore democracy and release Khan.""Khan, ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote, was arrested in August 2023 on corruption charges.His supporters claim the charges are politically motivated and backed by the military to block his return to power.

While Trump remains silent on Khan's situation, his ""envoy for special missions,"" Richard Grenell, has expressed support on social media.However, following his removal, Khan consistently blamed Washington for collaborating with Pakistan's opposition to remove him, citing his independent foreign policy and resistance to American influence.His public gatherings featured anti-American rhetoric, presenting his removal as an assault on Pakistani sovereignty. The Biden administration has rejected these allegations.Wilson acknowledged disagreeing with Khan's perspectives but added that such disputes require democratic resolution, stating, ""But political differences should be dealt with at the ballot box,"" he added.The bill requires the US government to identify those involved in political persecution in Pakistan within 180 days and impose penalties, including visa bans and entry restrictions.It specifically accuses General Asim Munir of ""knowingly engaging in the wrongful persecution and imprisonment of political opponents"" and calls for similar action against others.The bill allows for the removal of sanctions if Pakistan ends military rule, restores civilian democracy, and frees all detained political leaders.","Reps.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

SRINAGAR: The bodies of a young Kashmiri man and woman who jumped into the Jhelum near the LoC in Uri on March 5 were returned to their families Saturday after being retrieved from separate spots in the river in PoK. The handover took place at Kaman Post bridge, a crossing point originally built for trade and travel between the two sides of Kashmir.The bridge was opened for the first time since India suspended cross-LoC trade and travel in April 2019, citing concerns that the route was being misused by “Pakistan-based elements for funnelling weapons, narcotics, and fake money”.Though J&K police and disaster response teams had searched extensively, the bodies were found weeks later in PoK — 19-year-old Asiya Bano’s on March 19 and 22-year-old Yassir Hussain Shah’s on March 21. It wasn’t clear why the two natives of Uri in Baramulla district jumped into the Jhelum, which flows from J&K to Pakistan and joins the Chenub, a tributary of the Indus.Following a formal request from India, Pakistani authorities agreed to return the bodies. Senior civil and military officers from both countries, along with medical teams, facilitated the transfer at Kaman Post, about 115km east of Srinagar.“This was a humanitarian effort taken by both nations,” said NC legislator Sajjad Shafi from Uri. “The return of the bodies provides much-needed closure and relief to grieving loved ones.”","The bodies of a young Kashmiri man and woman who jumped into the Jhelum near the LoC in Uri on March 5 were returned to their families Saturday after being retrieved from separate spots in the river in PoK.
