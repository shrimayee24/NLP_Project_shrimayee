"Balasore sexual harassment case: She taught others to fight, but when she cried for help, no one turned up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/balasore-sexual-harassment-case-she-taught-others-to-fight-but-when-she-cried-for-help-no-one-turned-up/articleshow/122548875.cms,"File photo

BALASORE: She taught others to fight. She raised her voice. But when she cried for help, no one listened. The 20-year-old college student who set herself on fire after accusing her professor of sexual harassment was cremated Tuesday amid tears, anger and disbelief in her village in Odisha's Balasore district.Doctors at AIIMS Bhubaneswar declared her dead on Monday night, nearly 60 hours after the second-year student was admitted with critical burns.Her body arrived early Tuesday. Villagers gathered silently, some in shock, many in grief. Her mother wept beside the coffin: ""She had gone to college after Bahuda Yatra and said she would return soon. She promised. But she came back... like this.""The father, a clerk at a government-run women's college, stood frozen. ""My daughter was strong. If the investigation had been done properly from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened,"" he said.Wrapped in white, the woman who once taught self-defence, wrote poetry, excelled in stage acting and social work, and was taking disaster management classes, now lay still. Her elder brother, 24, choked through his sorrow. ""No matter how much politics is played now or how loudly people demand justice, what difference will it make?""The funeral procession passed through narrow lanes where she once played, studied and spoke up. ""Long live the brave daughter,"" mourners shouted as her body was taken to the cremation ground under heavy police deployment. Balasore MP Pratap Sarangi, Bhograi MLA Gautambuddha Das, Balasore Sadar MLA Manas Dutta, and Remuna MLA Gobinda Chandra Das attended the funeral. District officials also paid respects.At the cremation site, the grief broke into questions. ""Why did no one help her? Why was her voice ignored?"" asked neighbour Sunil Kar. ""She dared to speak. But her courage was met with silence."" Now, only silence remains.","20-year-old college student set herself on fire after accusing her professor of sexual harassment.

Odisha horror: Student sets self ablaze after HoD’s sexual harassment; says he threatened to lower marks if she didn’t give in; in critical condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/harassed-by-teacher-college-student-sets-herself-ablaze-is-critical/articleshow/122410179.cms,"Poll Should stricter laws be enforced against sexual harassment in educational institutions? Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.





BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back. ""She met me again on Saturday around 11 am and expressed severe distress. I summoned the teacher and spoke with both parties. Shortly after she left my office, we heard screams,"" the principal said, adding, ""Internal complaint committee did not find conclusive evidence of sexual harassment.""In the principal's suspension order, the higher education department stated that ""he has failed to perform his duties in the capacity of principal of the college"". It added that ""the matter has not been handled properly"".The principal has been barred from leaving Balsore without the district collector's permission. The accused teacher's suspension order said it was based on ""prima facie evidence"".DIG (eastern range), Satyajit Naik, said the accused faculty member has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide attempt and sexual harassment. A forensic team visited the site, and a detailed investigation is underway. ""Law and order is being strictly maintained on the college campus,"" Naik said.","A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises.

‘Carefully consider…’: Indian embassy in Iran issues fresh advisory; urges nationals to use available exit options,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/carefully-consider-indian-embassy-in-iran-issues-fresh-advisory-urges-nationals-to-use-available-exit-options/articleshow/122530597.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Iran issued a fresh advisory on late Tuesday, urging Indian nationals to avoid non-essential travel to the country, citing recent security-related developments.The advisory, posted late evening on the embassy's official handle on X, also asked those already in Iran to remain vigilant and consider returning using available commercial and ferry services.“In view of the security-related developments over the past several weeks, Indian nationals are advised to carefully consider the evolving situation before undertaking non-essential travel to Iran,” the embassy wrote.“They are also advised to continue to monitor the latest regional developments and follow updated advisories issued by the Indian authorities. Indian nationals already in Iran, and interested in leaving, may avail the commercial flight and ferry options which are available right now.”The warning comes amid heightened tensions in the region following a series of military escalations involving Israel, Iran, and the United States.Last month, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites including Natanz and Fordow. That was followed by Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, when the US struck multiple Iranian facilities.Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israel and a US base in Qatar. Later, US President Trump announced a ceasefire, ending the 12-day-long conflict.During the days of conflict, the Indian Embassy had cautioned Indian nationals in Iran to avoid unnecessary movement and follow safety protocols following the regional flare-up. That advisory had come in the wake of multiple explosions and reports of casualties at strategic Iranian locations.Adding to the concerns, the US state department last week launched a public awareness campaign warning Americans, especially those with Iranian heritage, against travel to Iran.US spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the Iranian regime routinely denies consular access to dual nationals and stressed that “it is not safe to travel to Iran,” despite the cessation of bombing.Meanwhile, Indian authorities are continuing to monitor the situation closely. The embassy has urged Indian citizens in Iran to stay connected via its social media platforms and to remain updated through official advisories.","The Indian Embassy in Iran issued a fresh advisory on late Tuesday, urging Indian nationals to avoid non-essential travel to the country.

"Pakistani drones back, pushing drugs & guns into India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistani-drones-back-pushing-drugs-guns-into-india/articleshow/122542427.cms,"Representative image

Pak drones fly at higher altitudes near border to avoid detection

AMRITSAR: Operation Sindoor put brakes on drone intrusions for a while but Pakistani smugglers have returned with upgraded tactics and are pushing drones deeper into Indian territory with alarming accuracy.""Post Op Sindoor, there was a temporary lull in cross-border drone intrusions. However, these activities have now resumed with greater precision as Pakistani smugglers are deploying drones that penetrate deeper into Indian territory to drop drugs, arms and ammunition,"" said BSF DIG AK Vidyarthi.According to sources, airdropping earlier was often close to the international border - around a kilometre in - but now Pakistani drones have been observed as far as 2km to 2.5km or even more inside Indian territory.A source said, “During Op Sindoor, priorities were broader — it wasn’t just about curbing cross-border smuggling but more about preventing drone and missile attacks. Smuggling activity from across the border significantly decreased since Pakistani smugglers lacked local operatives on the Indian side to retrieve dropped consignments.”But then, why have cross-border drone intrusions increased after Op Sindoor? As per sources, Pakistani smugglers have equipped themselves with more advanced Chinese drones, while the anti-drone technology deployed on the Indian border has not been as effective as it should be.Currently, drones are often detected only by their sound or spotted visually, after which information is relayed to the anti-drone team. The system is then activated to jam the drone or sever its connection with the operator in Pakistan. Such interceptors should ideally be placed every few kilometres along the international border in Punjab to instantly detect an incoming drone — its direction, speed, altitude and other details — so that it can be jammed and forced into the ground, said sources.Asked why Pakistani smugglers were trying to push drones deeper into Indian territory, sources pointed out BSF had intensified patrolling and tightened security and surveillance after Op Sindoor. By sending consignments deeper into Indian territory, smugglers seek to ensure receivers (collectors) are further away from the international border, minimising the chance of being detected by BSF patrols.Nowadays, Pakistani drone pilots tend to fly drones at higher altitudes near the border to avoid detection. Once the drones cross into Indian territory, they drop to a lower altitude and follow zigzag routes to dodge surveillance. Drones are also intentionally crashed once they reach the drop zone.","Pakistani smugglers are deploying drones that penetrate deeper into Indian territory to drop drugs, arms and ammunition.

Creating fear to stop people helping law is a terror act: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creating-fear-to-stop-people-helping-law-is-a-terror-act-supreme-court/articleshow/122540854.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Indicating that an offence cannot be said to be a terror act only if an accused is convicted under an anti-terror law, Supreme Court on Tuesday said creating an atmosphere of fear to prevent people from taking the side of law by killing an army informer is also a terrorist act despite anti-terror law not being invoked in the case.A bench comprising Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti did not agree that the killing of three civilians, including the army informer, in J&K with an AK-47 was not a terror act because the conviction was not secured under an anti-terror law, and expressed its reservation in entertaining a remission plea of a convict who has spent 27 years in jail in the case.Prisoner Ghulam Mohammad Bhat took the stand that he was not convicted under an anti-terror law, but only under the Indian Penal Code for murder, and therefore, his act cannot be termed a terrorist act. The J&K government told SC that a convict undergoing life imprisonment for a terror act was not entitled for remission under state policy.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the prisoner, said Bhat was convicted only under IPC section 302 (murder) and the Arms Act, and not under the then anti-terror legislation TADA. ""Nothing was proved in court to attract TADA provisions. The trial court or the HC never found it to be a terrorist act,"" he said.Additional solicitor general K M Natraj, appearing for the J&K government, submitted that explosive devices, including a weapon to launch grenades, were also reportedly recovered from the scene of incident and it was an act of terror, it was not a simple murder.Agreeing with Gonsalves, the bench said, ""If you want to create fear among people to ensure that no one approaches authorities against the illegal act then it is a terror act and we cannot close our eyes. ""This was done to create havoc to ensure that no one dares to side with the law, then it certainly carries the characteristics of a terrorist act and remission cannot be granted under the policy. You have to challenge the remission policy. ""SC, however, allowed Gonsalves's plea to be allowed to challenge the J&K remission policy within the ongoing proceedings.","Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti did not agree that the killing of three civilians, including the army informer, in J&K with an AK-47 was not a terror act.

NEW DELHI: India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, and four other social media influencers, appeared before the Supreme Court on Tuesday in a case concerning allegations of ridiculing people with disabilities, including those suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and blindness.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi recorded their presence and directed them to file their replies to the petition within two weeks, warning that no extensions would be granted. The court also instructed them to appear in person on the next date of hearing. An exception was made for influencer Sonali Thakkar, also known as Sonali Aditya Desai, who was permitted to appear virtually due to a physical condition.The bench, according to news agency PTI, observed the matter raised serious concerns and said that any absence by the influencers during the next hearing would be “viewed seriously.” The conduct of the influencers, the court said, was “damaging” and “demoralising,” and called for serious remedial and punitive action to ensure such incidents are not repeated.On the larger issue of social media content and accountability, the court asked Attorney General R Venkataramani to assist in framing guidelines that balance freedom of speech with the rights and dignity of others.Venkataramani sought time to deliberate, noting that enforceability would require detailed consideration.Justice Surya Kant remarked, “There are many free advisors in the market. Ignore them. The guidelines should be in conformity with constitutional principles balancing freedom and the rights and duties of a person. Then we will examine it. We will have open debate on such guidelines. Let all members of the bar and stakeholders including the so-called stakeholders also come and give their viewpoints.”Stressing the importance of dignity, Justice Kant added, “We need to understand that the right to dignity also emanates from the right which someone else is claiming. Article 19 of the Constitution,” he said, “can't overpower Article 21. Suppose a race takes place between Article 19 and 21, Article 21 has to trump Article 19.”He also underlined the need to frame guidelines with utmost caution. Speaking to senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who appeared for the NGO, Justice Kant said, “What we are doing is for posterity. You have to ensure that not a single word is misused by anyone. You have to ensure balance. We have to protect citizens' rights. A framework must be there that the dignity of anyone is not violated.”The top court had issued notices to Raina, Vipul Goyal, Balraj Paramjeet Singh Ghai, Sonali Thakkar, and Nishant Jagdish Tanwar, following a plea filed by NGO Cure SMA Foundation of India, which alleged that the influencers mocked persons with disabilities on a YouTube show.The Supreme Court had earlier, on May 5, warned the five influencers to appear before it or face coercive action. It had also directed the Mumbai Police Commissioner to serve notices to the individuals to ensure their attendance.Raina, along with podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, had been booked by police in Maharashtra and Assam over their comments made on the YouTube show India’s Got Latent. On February 18, the apex court granted interim protection to Allahbadia, but not before making scathing remarks on his conduct.The court had said his comments were “vulgar” and that he had a “dirty mind” which “put society to shame.”Others named in the case in Assam include comedians Ashish Chanchlani, Jaspreet Singh, and Apoorva Makhija. The court is also contemplating whether individual misconduct of this nature should be scrutinised more seriously under constitutional provisions, especially in light of the rights of people with rare disorders and disabilities.“No one,” the court said, “can be allowed to demean anybody under the garb of the right"".","India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, and four other social media influencers, appeared before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

Nimisha Priya death sentence case: How Blood Money payment works under Sharia Law?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nimisha-priya-death-sentence-case-how-blood-money-payment-works-under-sharia-law/articleshow/122546669.cms,"File photo: Nimisha Priya

Yemen has stayed the execution of nurse

Nimisha Priya

in a murder case, with hope resting on the kin of the deceased agreeing to settle for indemnity

What is Sharia?

What is Blood Money?

Do the guilty walk free after payment of Blood Money?

How many countries follow Sharia Law?

The Centre has told the Supreme Court that payment of blood money is the only option left for saving Kerala-origin nurse Nimisha Priya from the death row in Yemen. Such payments are permitted under Sharia law, the system of jurisprudence practised in many Islamic countries. Here's how it works:Sharia is an Arabic term meaning ""the way"" or ""the correct path"". It embodies rules and principles derived from the Quran, the Islamic holy book that is regarded as the direct word of God, and the Hadith, which represent the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Sharia, thus, is taken to lay down how Muslims should conduct themselves in their personal lives, social and commercial dealings, and spiritual pursuits.The legal dimension of Sharia is based on interpretations by Islamic jurists through a process known as 'fiqh'. These interpretations ensure the adaptability of precepts of the Sharia to evolving practical realities. So, while Sharia is not synonymous with Islamic law, the latter is derived from the Sharia based on fiqh. Given that interpretations stretch across time and geographies, there can be varying reckoning of Islamic laws based on the Sharia.The concept of retaliation is recognised in Sharia law based on 'qisas', or the principle of 'an eye for an eye'. In the case of murder, it means that the kin of the victim can demand death as punishment for the culprit. However, Sharia also allows for payment of 'diya', that is, compensation or indemnity, to the kin of the victim.Diya is permitted in cases where the kin of the victim waive their right to qisas and agree to settle for blood money. It is a right reserved for the victim's kin and can't be exercised by the state or govt on their behalf. That's why the campaign to save Nimisha Priya is appealing to the kin of the man she has been convicted of killing in Yemen. Their reported insistence on death for her is the hurdle to her being spared the death penalty. Different countries and jurisdictions can prescribe varying quanta of diya depending on the case and the victim.While it spares a culprit death as punishment for taking a life, it is debatable whether acceptance of diya by the victim's family amounts to an official pardon. Some experts say that Islamic jurisprudence has not clearly addressed this point. However, there are instances where a culprit has been taken off death row but kept in prison after the payment of diya. A notable example is the case of Abdul Rahim of Kerala.Convicted in Saudi Arabia for causing the death of his employer's son, Rahim obtained a pardon from the victim's family following the payment of a hefty ransom raised through a massive fundraising effort. However, the case was not closed after this and he was sentenced to 20 years in jail. The verdict took into account time spent in jail. So, while the crime occurred in 2006, and the pardon received in 2018, he is expected to be released only next year.There are about 50 Muslim-majority countries in the world and most are deemed to incorporate elements of Sharia law in their legal systems. Even when such a country has opted for a secular jurisprudence, there can be aspects - like family or personal laws - that are based on the Sharia.But the degree to which Sharia informs legal principles can vary widely. Further, not all Muslim-majority countries may carry out the form of extreme punishments, known as hudud, handed down for crimes such as adultery, rape, homosexuality, theft and murder.","The Centre has told the Supreme Court that payment of blood money is the only option left for saving Kerala-origin nurse Nimisha Priya from the death row in Yemen.

"In UK, tributes pour in for Fauja Singh after his death in Punjab",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-uk-tributes-pour-in-for-fauja-singh-after-his-death-in-punjab/articleshow/122544141.cms,"File photo: Fauja Singh (Picture credit: Sikhs in the city)

LONDON: Tributes are pouring in from across the UK for Fauja Singh, the oldest marathon runner in the world, who died on Monday after being hit by a car in his Punjab village at the age of 114.Writer and filmmaker Captain Jay Singh-Sohal told TOI: “I met him many times. He was a very inspiring figure who took great pride in doing what he was doing and in maintaining his Sikh identity with a turban and uncut beard, and in turn, he inspired many others. Not only did he inspire people of all ages to be physically active, but he also promoted the Sikh identity and took pride in doing so and showing young Sikhs, in particular, that their religious adherence was not a barrier to achieving great things. ”Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older. He quickly became a celebrity.“He was very down-to-earth and humble regardless of his fame. He ate very simply — just daal and rice. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me,” said MP Preet Kaur Gill.MP Tanmanjeet Singh said he would be “sorely missed.”“Despite his extraordinary and record-breaking achievements, he was completely down to earth and incredibly generous with his time,” recalled Hardeep Singh, deputy-director, Network of Sikh Organisations.Nick Bitel, London Marathon Group CEO, said: “Fauja Singh was an incredible, inspirational human being who epitomised the Spirit of the London Marathon. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Fauja Singh, now British, had been living back in Beas Pind, his birth village near Jalandhar, for the past five years, ever since the pandemic, when the accident happened.He was born in 1911 and had six children. One daughter died during childbirth in the 1980s and soon after that, his wife, Gian Kaur, died, and then his son, Kuldeep, died in an accident in front of him. That led to depression and so he came to the UK to stay with his son, Sukhjinder, and lived in Ilford. “He was a bit bored in an alien country where, at that time, there was not much Punjabi media. He went back to India to his family and then they sent him back to the UK. Then he started doing things for charity, like a 20km walk, and then he saw people running on TV and decided to do a marathon,” explained his British coach Harmander Singh, who met him in November 1999. Harmander trained him in just 11 weeks to run his first marathon, the London Marathon, in 2000, aged 89. Fauja Singh did nine marathons in total, his last one aged 101 in 2012 in London, which he completed in seven hours, 49 minutes.“He raised the profiles of charities and he always said it was the blessings of the beneficiaries of those charities that kept him going,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh liked his celebrity status as he got lots of attention, which kept him going, as many elderly people feel neglected.“He enjoyed the free socialising that came with his status and when he was invited by the former president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, to run the Lahore Marathon, he couldn’t believe that a poor illiterate farmer who had never gone to school was rubbing shoulders with a head of state,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh walked or jogged for 10 miles a day and ate a minimal diet, and was very light in weight. “Some medical students did bone density tests on him and found his left leg had the bone density of a 30-year-old and his right leg had one of a 20-year-old, and his response was, ‘I always knew my left leg was weak’,” Harmander added.His running group “Sikhs In The City”, is raising money for a clubhouse for the route he used to run along which will be named after him. The group is also appealing for anyone whose life he touched to send messages for a memorial book.","Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older.

Annabelle Handler Ghost Hunter Dead: Dan Rivera COLLAPSES During Chilling 'DEVILS ON THE RUN' Stop





Dan Rivera, a well-known paranormal investigator died on Sunday while touring with the infamous Annabelle doll in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, as confirmed by his tour organisers.Rivera was a US Army veteran and lead investigator with the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR). He was in the middle of his “Devils on the Run Tour” when emergency responders were called to his hotel. Despite efforts to revive him with CPR, he died at the scene. His exact cause of death remains unknown, New York post reported.Rivera was known for his appearances on paranormal television shows, including the Travel Channel’s “Most Haunted Places,” and for producing Netflix’s “28 Days Haunted.” He was touring with NESPR members to display Annabelle, a supposedly haunted doll made famous by paranormal legends.The tour had just completed a three-day sold-out stop in Gettysburg from Friday through Sunday, hosted at the Soldiers National Orphanage by Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours.Rivera often used social media, including popular TikTok videos, to promote the tour and share paranormal stories with a wide audience.Fellow paranormal investigator Ryan Buell paid tribute to Rivera.“I have so many amazing memories with this guy. Just as recently as two months ago, we traveled around the country and introduced a whole new generation to Ed and Lorraine Warren’s legacy,” Buell wrote on TikTok.Annabelle is linked to stories dating back to the 1970s. The Warrens claimed the doll was demonically possessed and responsible for disturbing activities, including moving on its own and causing harm. They moved it to the Connecticut museum for safekeeping.Ed and Lorraine Warren, who founded NESPR in 1952, gained fame investigating cases like the Amityville Horror. Their work inspired “The Conjuring” film series.After the deaths of Ed in 2006 and Lorraine in 2019, their daughter Judy and son-in-law Tony Spera took over the museum and NESPR. The museum closed to the public in 2019 due to local government regulations.","Dan Rivera, a well-known paranormal investigator died on Sunday while touring with the infamous Annabelle doll in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

Final journey to a place of meaning





NEW DELHI: Police in Punjab have arrested the suspected driver in the hit-and-run case that claimed the life of Fauja Singh, the world’s oldest marathon runner.The accused has been identified as Amritpal Dhillon.He was detained on Tuesday night from his home in a village in district Jalandhar.Dhillon told the police that he was returning from Bhogpur when the accident took place.The police FIR stated that the vehicle was speeding, and instead of taking Fauja Singh to the hospital after hitting him — which might have saved his life — the driver fled the scene.The 113-year-old athlete, widely celebrated for his long-distance running achievements well into his centenarian years, died on Monday after being struck by a white Toyota Fortuner on the Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway in Punjab.Officials said it took more than 24 hours to identify the vehicle involved, aided by broken headlight fragments recovered from the scene, CCTV footage from toll booths and fuel stations and eyewitness accounts.Singh was reportedly on his way to a roadside dhaba (eatery) run by his family in Beas Pind when the accident occurred.The eatery, named after his fifth son who died in an accident during its construction in 1994, held deep emotional significance for the former runner.“He visited us every few days, had a simple meal, and sat for tea. It was a kind of pilgrimage for him — to be near his son’s photo,” said Gurdeep Singh, who helps manage the dhaba.“People would often take selfies with him. We were proud to have him here,"" he added further.The accident reportedly occurred when Singh was crossing the highway.“He lay face down when we reached him,” said Gurpreet Singh, a resident who helped rush Singh to hospital.“We only realised it was him when we turned him over. It was devastating.”Though conscious and responsive at the time, Singh’s condition deteriorated rapidly. He passed away later that day.Alos read | Who was Fauja Singh?

BENGALURU: A physics lecturer from a private college in Dakshina Kannada and two of his friends have been arrested by Bengaluru police for allegedly blackmailing and raping a student.When the mental torture by the trio became intolerable, the girl narrated to her parents how she was being exploited. Subsequently, she went to Marathahalli police station along with her parents on July 5 and lodged a complaint seeking action against the perpetrators. Acting swiftly, the cops arrested the trio the following day.The accused are Narendra, a physics lecturer, Sandeep, a biology lecturer — both working in the coastal district — and their friend Anoop, a private firm employee based in Bengaluru.According to the police, prime accused Narendra came in contact with the girl while she was pursuing her second-year PU education. Narendra offered her academic support, including notes and study materials, and gradually established a rapport with her. He maintained regular communication with her via WhatsApp and other social media platforms.After she completed PU a few years ago, she moved back to Bengaluru. During a visit to the city, Narendra invited her to Anoop's room in the city on some false pretence and allegedly assaulted her sexually.That marked the beginning of the exploitation, police sources said.It is alleged that Sandeep, who was aware of the earlier incidents, began threatening her with the release of private photographs and videos, and subsequently sexually assaulted her as well. The third accused, Anoop, is alleged to have taken advantage of the situation by claiming he had installed CCTV cameras in the room and recorded footage of the girl with the other two men. Threatening to upload the videos on social media platforms, Anoop too allegedly assaulted her.When the harassment by the trio didn't show any signs of ending, the girl confided in her parents, following which they approached the Karnataka State Commission for Women. The commission provided counselling and supported the family in lodging a formal police complaint.Nagalakshmi Bai, chairperson of the commission, said: ""She (the survivor) explained how she was being blackmailed and subjected to the offence. After hearing her out, we wrote to the jurisdictional deputy commissioner of police, seeking action.Now, following the complaint, three men have been arrested. I request every girl subjected to blackmail or threats not to yield to pressure.Share the matter with your parents or family members, then approach us.

Ron MacLean claims Don Cherry used health scare to engineer his departure



Bobby Orr slams MacLean’s remarks and defends Cherry’s character

A legacy fractured by controversy and regret

In a fiery public statement, hockey icon Bobby Orr has come to the defense of his longtime friend Don Cherry, fiercely condemning comments made by broadcaster Ron MacLean about Cherry’s controversial 2019 exit from Hockey Night in Canada. The dispute, reignited by MacLean’s recent interview with the Kingston Whig Standard, has reopened old wounds over Cherry’s infamous “Poppygate” fallout and the end of one of hockey's most iconic broadcast partnerships.During the interview, Ron MacLean suggested that Cherry’s 2019 pneumonia scare was a turning point that prompted him to consider leaving Coach’s Corner. Referring to the infamous poppy controversy, MacLean alleged that Cherry used it as an “exit strategy” following serious health issues.“I think that pneumonia scare was it,” MacLean said via The Toronto Sun. “The pneumonia said to Don, ‘It’s time.’ He had to think, ‘Why is this grind suddenly so hard?’ He was ready to have an exit strategy. From that moment on, he was plotting a way out.""MacLean even claimed Cherry was hospitalized in Boston and required assistance at the time, a version of events that has been strongly disputed.Bobby Orr did not hold back in criticizing MacLean’s version of the story, describing the remarks as both inaccurate and deeply disrespectful to Cherry’s legacy.“Suggesting Don Cherry used encouraging people to wear poppies on Remembrance Day as an exit strategy from Coach’s Corner, revealing he had pneumonia in 2019 and that he doesn’t have many friends, I have only one thing to say to you Ron MacLean: Shame on you.”Orr’s statement has been echoed by Cherry’s family, including his son Tim, who flatly denied any hospitalization or planned exit, stating that Cherry never intended to leave the show prior to his dismissal.The MacLean-Cherry duo, once synonymous with Canadian hockey culture, has long since fractured under the weight of Cherry’s dismissal. While MacLean later apologized for not condemning Cherry’s poppy comments during the live broadcast, Cherry expressed deep disappointment, believing his co-host abandoned him in a moment of need.With Bobby Orr stepping into the fray, this decades-long relationship now appears irreparably damaged—one that once brought passion and color to Saturday night hockey but now symbolizes a cultural divide.Also Read: Stanley Cup shame sparks Oilers' panic move—goalie coach out as franchise refuses to face roster truth",Ron MacLean claims Don Cherry used health scare to engineer his departure from Hockey Night in Canada.

NEW DELHI: Protests broke out in Odisha’s Balasore district on Wednesday after a 20-year-old college student died following a self-immolation attempt, allegedly triggered by prolonged sexual harassment and institutional inaction.The student had accused her college Head of Department of harassment and had reportedly reached out to multiple authorities for help before setting herself on fire.Biju Janata Dal (BJD) workers led the protests, calling for a 'Balasore Bandh' from 6am to 2pm.Protestors burned tyres on roads and demanded the resignation of chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi and education minister Suryabanshi Suraj, blaming them for inaction in the case.""People in large numbers are joining our protest...The victim should get justice. The Chief Minister and the state health minister should resign.

EU backs Trump Ukraine U-turn but wants US to 'share burden',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-backs-trump-ukraine-u-turn-but-wants-us-to-share-burden/articleshow/122552662.cms,"Kaja kallas

Weapons deal details still under discussion



EU says US should 'share the burden'

Turning point or just one U-Turn?

Bye-bye to 'Buy European'?

EU fails to greenlight fresh round of Russia sanctions





The European Union's foreign affairs chief may be having something of an ""I told you so"" moment as US President Donald Trump reverses his past praise of Vladimir Putin and vows to ramp up pressure on Moscow.""We see from the United States that they have also realized that Russia does not really want peace,"" Kaja Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.The former Estonian prime minister made a name for herself as one of Ukraine's staunchest political backers, and warned at this week's EU talks that Russia's bombing campaign had ""reached record levels.""Kallas and many of her EU counterparts welcomed Washington's shift in rhetoric as they filed into a meeting. ""What we experienced yesterday with the new messages from Trump was very, very important,"" Denmark's Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.But some of the EU's top brass also had notes for the US on its latest announcements, including Washington's threat to slap 100% secondary tariffs on Russia and countries that trade with it unless a peace deal with Ukraine is reached by early September.""The 50 days that Mr. Trump has announced is rather long,"" Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said on the sidelines of Tuesday's talks.Trump also made headlines Monday with anannouncement that he'd be greenlighting sales of Patriot air defense systems and other arms to European countries to send on to Ukraine, just two weeks after Washington paused some arms shipments to Kyiv.The new plan should speed up and expand deliveries of US arms which Ukraine says it needs as it faces increased Russian aerial attacks.Some European countries have already been buying and sending US-made weapons to Kyiv, though the latest scheme could offer more certainty on the permissions needed to swiftly transfer the arms. A US commitment to sell replacements for American-made weapons sent to Ukraine could also encourage European states to ship more of their own military supplies.NATO chief Mark Rutte said the deal would ""work through NATO systems"" and that European countries including Germany, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands were all interested in taking part.But the US is yet to disclose more details of its new scheme and DW understands the technicalities of exactly how it will work are still being discussed.Trump was, however, quick to cast the new deal as a lucrative business opportunity for the US, stressing Europe would foot the bill. And that seems to be raising some eyebrows among his counterparts across the Atlantic.The EU's Kallas told reporters after Tuesday's meeting that she would like to see Europe and the US ""share the burden"" of arming Ukraine.""If we pay for these weapons, it's our support — so it's European support — and we are doing as much as we can to help Ukraine. And therefore the call is that everybody would do the same,"" she said.""If you promise to give the weapons then say that somebody else is going to pay for it, it's not really given by you, is it?"" Kallas added.Denmark's Rasmussen made a similarly veiled allusion. ""We are providing a lot of funding for Ukraine to buy whatever weapons and ammunition they need … But I mean, I would very much like to see all our partners actually also contributing if we want this war to stop,"" he said.While the US ranks as Ukraine's single largest donor since its full-scale invasion by Russia, the European Union as a whole has spent roughly the same amount as Washington over the same period, according to data from the Kiel Institute cited by Radio Free Europe. The EU outspends the US when the cost of hosting and assisting Ukrainian refugees is factored in.EU states may be breathing a sigh of relief after the US policy shift, but policy analyst Torrey Taussig says it's too soon to judge whether Trump's stance has changed for good.""There has been a seesaw approach to this relationship throughout the last several months of this administration, and I wouldn't be surprised if this relationship, the US-Ukrainian relationship, still has more turns that it can take,"" the former US government official turned Atlantic Council fellow told DW.""I'm very reluctant to call this a strategic shift in the US-Ukrainian relationship,"" she added, though added that the two sides' ties now seem far more ""positive.""With European countries racing to boost their own defenses amid pressure from the US and a broader rethink of the EU's geopolitical fragility, governments have been debating how much of a planned military spending splurge should go to US weapons.Arms purchases, especially those involving large weapons systems, tend to lock the buyer into a years-long relationship with the seller, from production to delivery to future repairs.Experts say ending Europe's dependency on the American-made weapons, logistics and intelligence capacities it lacks could take at least a decade — and with US foreign policy proving unpredictable, that leaves some worried.EU heavyweight France has pushed for more European-only purchases, frustrating some other states which argued this only serves to slow down the process of getting weapons into European and Ukrainian hands.The latest US-led plan may be seen by some as a blow to France's efforts, with the potential for more European money to flow toward US arms manufacturers.As Europe nudges the US to do more to support Ukraine and punish Russia, the bloc's own efforts are faltering. Kallas said she was ""really sad"" that ministers failed to adopt an 18th round of EU sanctions on Moscow on Tuesday due to a holdout by Slovakia.The landlocked central European state has been protesting planned EU laws to ban all sales of Russian gas, and Prime Minister Roberto Fico said in an online post on Tuesday that Slovakia had asked the EU to postpone the vote on sanctions while his government mulled its response to an exchange with the EU's executive aimed at ending the stalemate.Kallas said she was ""optimistic"" an agreement could be struck among EU states in the coming days.","EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas says she would like to see Europe and the US ""share the burden"" of arming Ukraine.

'He taught the Unabomber': Trump claims his uncle was longest serving MIT professor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-taught-the-unabomber-trump-claims-his-uncle-was-longest-serving-mit-professor-is-it-true/articleshow/122552943.cms,"The real story of the Unabomber





At a campaign-style event in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump made a characteristically meandering claim that his uncle, the late Dr John Trump, was the longest-serving professor in the history of MIT and had taught one of America’s most notorious domestic terrorists, the Unabomber. But while the anecdote grabbed attention, almost none of it appears to be true.“I have to brag just for a second,” Trump said at the Energy and Innovation event hosted by Senator Dave McCormick. “Although my uncle was at MIT, one of the great professors, 51 years, whatever. He was longest serving professor in the history of MIT… Kaczynski was one of his students.”Referring to the late Ted Kaczynski, who carried out a 17-year bombing spree that killed three and injured 23, Trump added: “I said, what kind of a student was he? Uncle John, Dr John Trump? He said seriously good. He said he’d go around correcting everybody. But it didn’t work out too well for him.”The problem? Kaczynski never attended MIT, and Trump’s uncle was not the longest-serving professor there.A spokesperson for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had earlier told Newsweek that while Dr John Trump had a long and respected academic career at the university, he was not its longest-serving professor. Based on MIT’s records, at least 10 professors have served 53 years or longer.Trump’s uncle worked at MIT in various capacities from 1933 until his death in 1985, with 37 years as a full professor and later roles as senior lecturer and professor emeritus.There’s also no evidence that Kaczynski who completed his undergraduate studies at Harvard and earned graduate degrees in mathematics at the University of Michigan, ever studied at MIT. In fact, by the time Trump’s uncle had already been working at MIT for decades, Kaczynski was still a child.Theodore “Ted” Kaczynski, later dubbed the “Unabomber” by the FBI, lived in a remote cabin in Montana where he built homemade bombs and conducted a campaign of terror against scientists and industrial targets between 1978 and 1995.

WASHINGTON: Supreme Court agreed Monday the Trump administration can proceed with dismantling the education department by firing more than 1,000 workers.The order is a significant victory for the administration and could ease Trump's efforts to sharply curtail the federal government's role in the nation's schools.The Trump administration has announced plans to fire over 1,300 workers, a move that would effectively gut the department, which manages federal loans for colleges and enforces civil rights laws in schools. The department began the year with more than 4,000 employees.

LONDON: Britain set up a secret scheme to relocate thousands of Afghans to the UK after a soldier accidentally disclosed the personal details of more than 33,000 people, putting them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban, court documents showed on Tuesday.A judge at London’s high court said in a May 2024 judgment first made public Tuesday that about 20,000 people may have to be offered relocation to Britain, a move that would likely cost “several billion pounds”.Britain’s current defence minister John Healey said that around 4,500 affected people “are in Britain or in transit ... at a cost of around 400 million pounds”.The government is also facing lawsuits from those affected by the breach. A ministry of defence-commissioned review of the breach, a summary of which was also published Tuesday, said more than 16,000 affected people had been relocated to the UK as of May this year.The government was forced to act after the breach revealed the names of Afghans who had helped British forces in Afghanistan before they withdrew from the country in chaotic circumstances in 2021.

Last walk to dhaba: Fauja Singh ran to heal after son's death; died on way to eatery built in his memory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/last-walk-to-dhaba-fauja-singh-ran-to-heal-after-sons-death-died-on-way-to-eatery-built-in-his-memory/articleshow/122550386.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Fauja Singh, the world’s oldest marathon runner, died in a tragic echo of his past - much like his fifth son, who lost his life in a road accident . On Monday, the 113-year-old was struck by a speeding vehicle near his home in Beas Pind, Jalandhar.He was walking across the Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway to visit Kuldeep Dhaba, the family eatery named in memory of his son Kuldeep, who had died in 1994 during the dhaba's construction at another location.That loss had once broken Fauja, later running became his way of healing and in a tragic twist, his final steps were toward the very place built to remember the son he never stopped mourning.“He would visit us every 4-5 days and have one chapati with a small bowl of vegetables or dal and a cup of tea. He would chat with us and those who were around. The last time he visited us was 4-5 days ago.When other visitors spotted him sitting here, he was always a great attraction, and they would take selfies with him. We always took pride in his presence and that his photo adorned the dhaba,” said Gurdeep Singh, who looks after the eatery.“I knew him for 40 years and sometimes accompanied him to events. I could not sleep last night.I believed we were earning our bread and butter with his blessings,” Gurdeep added, breaking down. “He was very alert and witty. Always unassuming in his interaction with people.”Beas Pind resident Gurpreet Singh was among the first to reach the spot. “We rushed towards him. He lay face down. It was only after we lifted him that we saw it was Fauja Singh, the pride of our village. It was a brutal shock. He was badly injured but conscious. We rushed him to a hospital on the same highway” he said.Police have since arrested the accused, identified as Amritpal Dhillon, who was detained on Tuesday night from a village in Jalandhar district. He told police he was returning from Bhogpur when the accident occurred. The FIR states that the vehicle was speeding and that the driver fled without offering any assistance—had he stopped and taken Fauja Singh to the hospital immediately, the legend might still be alive today.The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday paid heartfelt tributes to the global icon. Parliamentary affairs minister Dr Ravjot Singh, who moved a condolence motion, called Fauja Singh “the world’s oldest runner” and praised him for bringing immense pride to the Sikh community through his marathon achievements. Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan remembered him as a spirited soul who, despite his age, inspired generations with his strength, humility, and discipline.","Fauja Singh, the world’s oldest marathon runner, died in a tragic echo of his past - much like his fifth son, who lost his life in a road accident.

She Spent 7 Hours in Target to Steal THOUSANDS in Merchandise





An Indian tourist’s shopping trip to a Target store in the United States took a dramatic turn when she was caught allegedly shoplifting items worth nearly $1,000 (approx. Rs 1.1 lakh), leading to her arrest on the spot.A police bodycam video of the incident has now gone viral.The moment of her arrest was captured and shared by the independent YouTube channel @BodyCamEdition, which uploads raw police footage.In the video, Avlani is seen pleading with officers to let her pay for the items she allegedly tried to take. “Why can’t I just pay for it?” she asks, to which an officer replies, “We’re way, way, way past that. You committed a felony.”“But if I’m paying for it, what is the harm?” she says, only to be told: “It would have been fine if you didn’t leave, right? You would have had that opportunity to pay. But because you left the store at that point, you chose to not pay for it, and we can’t go back.”Legal experts say that such an incident can carry serious consequences, especially for foreign nationals. “Regardless, this is a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude, namely one that involves dishonesty and could have serious consequences,” said Alen Takhsh, a US-based immigration attorney.“If you are in the US on a student visa, an arrest for shoplifting, let alone a conviction, could result in your visa being revoked. If you are in the US on a visitor or work visa, it could lead to you not being allowed to re-enter the US in the future.”The video has amassed over 835,000 views and triggered heated discussions online. Some sympathise with Avlani, suggesting cultural misunderstanding, while others express embarrassment over how such actions reflect on the Indian community abroad.","An Indian tourist’s shopping trip to a Target store in the United States took a dramatic turn.

Donald Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskyy whether Ukraine could strike Moscow, an inquiry that the White House says was merely a question but one that came hours after he voiced frustration at Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to accept a ceasefire in the war.During a July 4 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Trump quizzed Zelenskyy about whether Ukraine could hit the Russian capital and St Petersburg if given US long-range weapons, according to a person briefed about the conversation. Zelenskyy replied that it could if the US provided the weapons, the person said.Asked about the details of the call, which were first reported by Financial Times, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: ""President Trump was merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing. He's working tirelessly to stop the killing and end this war."" The conversation took place a day after Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" by a phone call with Putin, in which the Russian leader insisted he wouldn't back down on his war aims.Ukraine has successfully targeted Moscow with drones in the past, but the long-range missiles provided by its allies so far have lacked the capabilities to reach the city.Details of the discussion emerged a day after Trump pledged fresh weapons supplies to Kyiv that would be paid for by Nato allies, mainly from Europe, and threatened harsh penalties targeting Russian oil sales if Putin doesn't end the war on Ukraine within 50 days.Oil declined for a second day as traders doubted Trump's plan would pose a meaningful obstacle to Moscow's energy exports. Trump's move to raise pressure on Putin came after months of unsuccessful diplomacy aimed at persuading Russia to halt the war and negotiate a peace deal. Instead, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks.Trump told BBC in an interview on Monday that he was ""disappointed"" in Putin, but not ""done with him"". The US president didn't explain how the proposed ""secondary tariffs"" would work, but he has used the term in the past to describe duties imposed on countries for trading with American adversaries. The threats echo punishment spelled out in a bipartisan bill in Congress that would impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas such as China and India.","Donald Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskyy whether Ukraine could strike Moscow.

Three months after shutting down Nvidia's AI intelligence chip sales to China, the Trump administration has reversed course.On Monday, the Silicon Valley company said the US government had approved sales of a China-specific AI chip known as H20. Nvidia will still need licencing approval from US government to fulfill those orders, but the Trump administration ""has assured Nvidia that licences will be granted,"" the company said.The decision came after Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, met last Thursday with President Trump. Huang has spent months lobbying politicians across Washington to keep China open for AI chip sales. China has the potential to deliver billions of dollars in sales for the world's most valuable public company, which last week became the first to reach a $4 trillion valuation. Huang has also visited China several times this year, including a trip to Beijing this week where he is scheduled to give a news conference on Wednesday.Commerce department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The reversal has major implications for the race between the US and China to develop AI. It will allow Chinese tech companies to restart purchases of Nvidia's chips, regarded as ideal for running some of the calculations that power AI.Nvidia was slated to collect as much as $15 billion from sales of the H20 chip during its current fiscal year.With the change, Trump government has also backed away from a signature effort to stay ahead of China in the AI race. US government had been concerned the Chinese military could use AI chips to coordinate attacks and develop weapons and had also wanted to preserve the US lead in developing AI systems. Huang pressed the administration to roll back its restrictions on shipments of AI chips to China, arguing that closing off the China market will only hurt US tech companies.","The US government has approved sales of a China-specific AI chip known as H20.

The 2005 conviction





MELBOURNE: Bradley John Murdoch, known as the ""Outback Killer"" and convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio who vanished in arid central Australia 24 years ago, has died, authorities said Wednesday. He was 67.Murdoch died Tuesday night in the palliative care unit of the Alice Springs Hospital, according to a statement from the northern territory department of corrections. He was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was recently transferred to the hospital from the Alice Springs prison.His death leaves the mystery of the whereabouts of Falconio's body unsolved. The northern territory police force said Murdoch had apparently taken that secret to his grave.""The Northern Territory Police Force remains committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation,"" a police statement said.""It is deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio's remains,"" police said. ""His silence has denied the Falconio family the closure they have so long deserved.""In 2005, Murdoch was convicted of the 2001 murder of 28-year-old Falconio, from Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and the attempted kidnapping of Falconio's girlfriend Joanne Lees.The crime captured global attention and was one of the inspirations for the 2005 Australian horror movie ""Wolf Creek,"" about a serial killer who preyed on backpackers and left a single witness who became a suspect.Lees, who wrote about her ordeal in her 2006 memoir ""No Turning Back,"" complained that police treated her as a suspect in the years before Murdoch was charged.A court order prevented the movie's release in the northern territory during Murdoch's trial, fearing it could influence jurors. Murdoch was not accused of any other killings.Maintaining his innocence Murdoch consistently maintained his innocence and did not help authorities search for Falconio's remains.At the time of the killing, Murdoch was an interstate drug runner, using amphetamines to stay awake for dayslong drives and cannabis to sleep.On the night of July 14, 2001, he tricked Falconio and Lees into stopping their campervan on a dark and remote highway north of Alice Springs.Lees watched her boyfriend leave the van to inspect a supposedly sparking exhaust pipe. She testified that she heard a gunshot and never saw her boyfriend again.Murdoch, an imposing 193 centimeters (6 foot, 4 inches) in height, bound her wrists with cable ties before she managed to escape and hid in the desert scrub for hours. She testified she watched Murdoch searching for her with a flashlight and his dog.Lees later waved down a truck and raised the alarm.Police doubled the reward for information last month, police doubled the reward for information leading to the location of Falconio's remains to 500,000 Australian dollars ($330,000), following news that Murdoch was in palliative care.""Police still hold out hope that someone may be able to provide some vital information to assist in this search,"" police commander Mark Grieve said.Colleen Gwynne, a former police officer who led the investigation at the time of Falconio's disappearance, said Murdoch might have panicked after Lees escaped and in his confusion forgot what he did with the body.A sentence to life in prison ""Once that panic set in ... he may have disposed of a body somewhere he's not entirely certain where that is,"" Gwynne told 10 Network News television earlier this month.Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for Falconio's murder and was ordered to serve at least 28 years before he could be considered for parole. He was also sentenced to six years for assaulting Lees.The earliest he could have applied for parole would have been 2032, but without providing information as to what he had done with Falconio's body, Murdoch was not likely to have been released. The territory passed laws in 2016 preventing prisoners convicted of murder from qualifying for parole unless they provide police with the location of their victims' bodies.Murdoch was born in the west coast town of Geraldton, the third child of an automobile mechanic and his wife, a hairdresser.As a teen, he became involved in biker gang crime and was first sentenced to prison in 1995 for shooting at a group of Indigenous people at Fitzroy crossing in western Australia. He served 15 months of a 21-month sentence.In sentencing Murdoch for Falconio's killing, Chief Justice Brian Martin said he doubted any words could express the trauma and terror Lees had suffered.""It must have been close to the worst nightmare imaginable,"" the judge said.",Bradley John Murdoch was convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio.

California Democrat rep Ro Khanna will file an amendment to an Act that would require Attorney General Pam Bondi to release Epstein's client list as the Donald Trump administration is already in a tough spot over the issue. Khanna said he will file an amendment to the GENIUS Act, a cryptocurrency bill slated to be marked up by the House Rules Committee on Tuesday. Axios reported that the amendment would require Bondi to ""retain, preserve and compile any records or evidence related to any investigation, prosecution or incarceration"" of Epstein.Bondi would then have to ""release and publish"" the records ""on a publicly available website"" within 30 days of the GENIUS Act being signed into law.But it's highly unlikely that Ro Khanna's amendment would make it to the House floor.“Why are the Epstein files still hidden? Who are the rich & powerful being protected?” Khanna wrote on social media Sunday while announcing his plans. A vote would “put every Congress member on record” about making the files public, he continued.Rep. Mark Veasey (D-Texas) also announced on social media that he’ll be introducing a resolution Monday demanding the release of the files.“Either [President Donald Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there!” he wrote, suggesting the possibility of a cover-up.The handling of the Epstein files created a major rift in the Donald Trump administration and FBI deputy director Dan Bongino was on the verge of resigning over his disagreement with Pam Bondi. Bondi overpromised for months about Epstein releases and then the administration announced that Epstein did not have any client list and hence, there would be no more investigation or prosecution in the case.“Dan Bongino is a very good guy.

Federal scrutiny and protest response



Legal challenges and local response







A major immigration raid at two marijuana farms in Southern California has resulted in more than 360 arrests, a death, and rising tensions between federal authorities and local officials.The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.It has been described as one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office, according to the department of homeland security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem.The DHS executed criminal search warrants at the two sites, with officers in tactical gear storming the greenhouses. The raids sparked confusion and fear among workers and nearby residents, many of whom gathered at the Camarillo location demanding information about their loved ones. One worker, 57-year-old Jaime Alanis, fell from a greenhouse roof while hiding and died two days later in hospital. His niece confirmed his death, noting that he had worked at the farm for a decade and was the sole provider for his wife and daughter in Mexico.Originally, federal officials said around 200 people had been arrested for alleged immigration violations. That number later increased to 361. Among those detained, four had prior convictions including rape and kidnapping.The federal government said it launched the raids to investigate suspected child labour, human trafficking , and abuse. DHS initially said 10 children were found on the property, later raising that number to 14. However, no charges have been filed, and the agency has not released details about the children, their ages, or their activities on site.Glass House Farms began in Carpinteria and later expanded to Camarillo, where it operates both cannabis and tomato greenhouses. State cannabis regulators said no minors were seen during a May inspection. Following a complaint, they reopened an investigation.The raids triggered protests, with tensions flaring between demonstrators and armed agents. Smoke filled the air as crowds clashed with authorities. Federal agents also arrested four US citizens accused of resisting or assaulting officers.The raids come amid growing backlash from immigrant advocates and local leaders. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt broad immigration stops in seven California counties. The justice department has appealed, calling the order vague and difficult to enforce.Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass responded by signing an executive order to support affected communities. The city will work with partners to distribute emergency cash assistance through immigrant rights groups. The funds aim to support residents too scared to go to work or access public services. The city also plans to train staff and establish a police working group to prepare for future immigration actions.Officials say the federal government has not shared the full search warrant or offered evidence to back its claims of trafficking or abuse.","The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.

Trump hails decision as ‘major victory’







The US Supreme Court has given the green light to President Donald Trump 's plan to dismantle the federal education department, allowing the administration to move forward with laying off nearly 1,400 employees.In a 6-3 decision on Monday, the justices paused a lower court ruling that had temporarily blocked the layoffs. The order, issued by US District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, had reversed the dismissals and raised doubts about Trump’s broader plan to shut down the department.The high court’s decision now allows the administration to resume one of Trump’s campaign pledges to dismantle the education department and shift its responsibilities back to individual states.The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the majority ruling, expressing concern over the impact of the layoffs and the wider implications for federal oversight of education.The Biden-appointed Judge Joun had previously granted a preliminary injunction against the move, saying it could cause “irreparable harm” to thousands of students and families who rely on federal education services. His ruling questioned the legality of bypassing Congress in shutting down a federal agency and freezing its operations.Trump responded to the ruling on social media, calling it a win for his education agenda. “This is a major victory for students and parents,” he wrote. “The failing Education Department will now go BACK TO THE STATES.”The administration has argued that states are better equipped to manage education without federal intervention and that local control would lead to more effective and tailored learning policies. Critics, however, say dismantling the department could leave millions of students without consistent oversight, especially in underserved communities.","The US Supreme Court has given the green light to President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the federal education department.

Mike Waltz Stammers When Questioned On Leaked Houthi Strikes In US Senate Hearing





Two suspects have been accused with helping Benjamin Hanil Song, a military veteran, avoid arrest after he tried to attack an ICE detention centre in Alvarado, Texas.John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp are among 14 people accused in connection with the July 4 attack at the Prairieland Detention Centre. According to a criminal complaint, both are charged with hindering the arrest of Benjamin Hanil Song, the alleged gunman, as reported by Fox News.Authorities say Thomas and Sharp did not participate directly in the shooting but helped Song avoid capture afterward. Investigators allege they coordinated using encrypted Signal group chats to plan the attack and manage Song’s movements. The complaint states that on July 7, Sharp planned to transfer Song from Thomas to another unidentified person.Sharp reportedly withdrew from the July 4 plan shortly before the incident, citing ""family problems,"" but continued to monitor chats and offered financial help. Thomas allegedly ran the chat groups and picked up Song after the shooting.Due to evidence that they knew about Song’s intentions and actions, both are accused of hindering an attempted murderer’s apprehension. Their criminal complaint was signed on Monday evening.Thomas was arrested on July 10 and is being held on a $5 million bond for a charge of smuggling people. Sharp was arrested on July 13 and is being held on a $2.5 million bond for hindering the prosecution of terrorism.The main suspect, Benjamin Hanil Song, is charged with six felonies related to the ambush. He is accused of firing at two correctional officers and one Alvarado Police Department officer. One officer was shot in the neck and is expected to recover.Song reportedly hid in the woods near the detention centre after the attack before being picked up and helped by Thomas and Sharp. Following his identification, a Blue Alert was issued on July 9, and he was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted list.On Tuesday evening, the department of justice announced that Song had been captured in Dallas. Previously, the FBI had announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song’s arrest.","John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp are among 14 people accused in connection with the July 4 attack at the Prairieland Detention Centre.

Bessent confirmed that “there’s a formal process that’s already starting” to find the next Federal Reserve chair, whose term expires in 2026.“There are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve,"" he was quoted as saying to Bloomberg.Bessent also suggested that Powell should consider stepping down from the Fed entirely once his chairmanship ends to avoid confusion and maintain market stability.“Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down as a governor,” Bessent said. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance of his or her nomination. And I can tell you, I think it’d be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also,"" he added.However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to push back against these ideas, stressing the importance of the Fed’s independence.After an earnings call, Dimon said, “I think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical.” As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Dimon warned, “Playing around with the Fed can have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.”The Trump administration has been vocal in its desire for a Fed leader who favours lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. US President Donald Trump has publicly called for Powell to “resign immediately,” blaming him for not cutting interest rates aggressively enough and branding him “very bad for the country.” Trump argued, '“Every point [of interest] costs us $360 billion,” insisting rates should fall below 1%.Beyond verbal criticism, the White House, through Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, has accused Powell of “gross mismanagement” and extravagance over a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Letters from the White House questioned the necessity and legality of the project, suggesting these concerns could be grounds for removal. Other officials, such as Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have publicly stated that Powell’s resignation “would be the right decision for America. ”Despite all this, Bessent emphasised that Trump has “numerous times” said he is not going to fire Powell. Powell himself has requested an inspector general review of the renovation project and reaffirmed his commitment to complete his term.As for who might succeed Powell, Bessent denied speculation about his own candidacy, saying he is “part of the decision-making process” but pointing out there are “a lot of good, strong candidates” both inside and outside the Federal Reserve.The Trump administration is reportedly aiming to announce a nominee as early as October or November.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the search for Powell's replacement is now officially underway.

"'It's a delicate subject, but...': Trump aide Mike Johnson on release of Epstein files; demands Pam Bondi to 'come forward'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-a-delicate-subject-but-trump-aide-mike-johnson-on-release-of-epstein-files-demands-pam-bondi-to-come-forward/articleshow/122543931.cms,"Mike Johnson (AP image)





US House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on the Justice Department to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein , the disgraced financier who died in federal custody in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges.In an interview on Tuesday with podcaster Benny Johnson, Mike said: “It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.”Johnson’s remarks marked a rare public disagreement with US President Donald Trump , his close ally in Congress, over an issue that has angered many in Trump’s conservative base, as reported by The Guardian.Trump has faced criticism from his supporters for failing to make public all information about Epstein, who allegedly had ties to many powerful figures. Last week, the justice department concluded that Epstein’s death was a suicide and announced that no list of clients would be released, rejecting conspiracy theories.Conservative allies of Trump have accused him and US attorney general Pam Bondi of handling the case poorly.During the interview, Speaker John also referred to Bondi’s earlier claim on Fox News that she had Epstein’s client list on her desk to review: “She needs to come forward and explain that to everybody.We need the DOJ focusing on major priorities. So let’s get this thing resolved.”Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans voted down a proposal from Democrats. The proposal would have added a rule to a new law that would require the justice department to release Epstein-related files.Despite this setback, Democrats say they will keep pushing the issue. Members of the House Judiciary Committee have called on its Republican chair, Representative Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, to hold hearings with Bondi, her deputy and FBI leaders to answer questions about Epstein.Speaking to reporters before leaving the White House for Pittsburgh on Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi but suggested she could choose to release more documents: “She’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her. Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.”When NBC News asked Bondi about Trump's MAGA allies' frustration with how she has handled the case, she shifted the focus to other issues: “We’re going to fight to keep America safe again. We’ve got a war on drugs. We’ve got a war on human trafficking. We’ve got cartels in this country … we have foreign adversaries around this world as well, and we’re all going to work together as a team.”","US House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on the Justice Department to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

'Pretty boring stuff': Donald Trump downplays 'fascination' surrounding Epstein files; blames ‘bad people’ for keeping it alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pretty-boring-stuff-donald-trump-downplays-fascination-surrounding-epstein-files-blames-bad-people-for-keeping-it-alive/articleshow/122542816.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed renewed interest in the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling it “pretty boring stuff” and saying he didn’t understand why many of his own supporters were so focused on it.Speaking to reporters in Pennsylvania after an event, Trump reacted to questions about ongoing uproar within his base following the release of a Justice department and FBI memo last week. The memo said Epstein had no client list and confirmed he died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019.“I don’t understand it, why they would be so interested. He’s been dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don’t understand what the interest and what the fascination is. I really don’t. And the credible information has been given,” Trump said.He added, “I don’t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It’s pretty boring stuff. It’s sordid, but it’s boring. And I don’t understand why it keeps going. I think really only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going.”Despite Trump's remarks, many within the MAGA movement remain unsatisfied with the government’s findings. The absence of a ""client list"" in the memo has fuelled speculation among conspiracy theorists, who have long believed that high-profile Democrats and celebrities were connected to pedophile Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking network.Anger has also been directed at US attorney general Pam Bondi, with people for her removal over what they claim is a lack of transparency around the Epstein files. Bondi had previously said in a February interview that an Epstein client list was “sitting on” her “desk” for review. She has since clarified that she was referring more broadly to files connected to the case.On Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi but said she should move forward with any disclosures that can be verified.“But she’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her whatever she thinks is credible, she should release,” Trump said.In early June, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Trump's former right-hand man reignited controversy by suggesting that the MAGA chief's name appears in the unreleased Epstein files, claiming this was the real reason they had not been made public.Musk first made the allegation on X, saying ,“Time to drop the really big bomb… @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” before later deleting the post. He has since called on the White House to release all related documents, demanding full transparency.Epstein had faced multiple accusations of trafficking underage girls and was known to associate with powerful figures such as Trump, former US President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain, and several wealthy elites. His long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the abuse. His death is still debated by many, with conspiracy theories claiming he was murdered to protect high-profile individuals. Despite official rulings that he died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019, questions around security failures and missing footage have fuelled public suspicion and kept the controversy alive.",President Donald Trump said he didn't understand renewed interest in the Jeffrey Epstein case.

"Trump eases immigration crackdown? 2,000 National Guard troops to leave Los Angeles; Newsom calls them ‘political pawns of president’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-eases-immigration-crackdown-2000-national-guard-troops-to-leave-los-angeles-newsom-calls-them-political-pawns-of-president/articleshow/122541881.cms,"4000 guards had been stationed in Los Angeles





The Pentagon has ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to leave Los Angeles, scaling down a deployment that began in response to protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The decision to withdraw nearly half of the soldiers stationed in the city was made on Tuesday amid ongoing tensions.About 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines had been stationed across LA since early June.Officials did not provide a clear reason for the sudden move, but it appeared to be a step back from the heavy military presence that had previously drawn criticism from LA mayor Karen Bass and California governor Gavin Newsom.The Trump administration’s decision to deploy troops had sparked widespread protests. On June 8, demonstrators flooded city streets, blocked a major freeway, and clashed with police using rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash bangs. In the chaos, several Waymo driverless cars were set on fire.The unrest continued the following day, as officers pushed protesters using flash bangs and projectiles. Bystanders, including restaurant workers, rushed to get out of the way.In response, mayor Karen Bass imposed a week-long curfew.By Tuesday afternoon, there was no sign of military presence at the downtown federal complex, which had been the centre of early protests. National Guard troops had first secured the area before Marines were assigned to protect federal buildings. Some soldiers had also helped with immigration operations in the city.Newsom had strongly opposed the deployment and sued the federal government, arguing it violated both state rights and the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military from performing law enforcement duties on American soil.Although a federal judge first ruled in favour of Newsom, a higher court later overturned the decision, letting the federal government keep control of the Guard. The court is expected to hear more arguments next month.In a statement following the Pentagon’s decision, Newsom criticised the ongoing mission. “The National Guard’s deployment to Los Angeles County has pulled troops away from their families and civilian work to serve as political pawns for the President,” he said.He added, “We call on Trump and the Department of Defense to end this theatre and send everyone home now.”The withdrawal of troops follows last week’s heavily criticised federal operation at MacArthur Park, where troops and agents arrived with guns and horses. Department of homeland security (DHS) declined to explain the mission or confirm any arrests, with locals accusing the move of being a show of intimidation.","About 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines had been stationed across LA since early June.

White House security breach: ‘Phone’ was thrown over the fence; lockdown imposed briefly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-security-breach-phone-was-thrown-over-the-fence-lockdown-imposed-briefly/articleshow/122537329.cms,"ANI file photo





The White House was temporarily put under lockdown on Tuesday after a “phone” was thrown over the security fence. ""Somebody threw their phone over the fence"", confirmed the press secretary Karoline Leavitt.This immediately prompted security measures by Secret Service agents as they responded to reports of an object being thrown which appeared to be a “phone”, over the North Lawn fence around midday, reported ANI.Members of the press corps awaiting education secretary Linda McMahon’s appearance on Fox News were swiftly escorted into the James S. Brady Briefing Room as agents secured the area, prohibiting access.The Secret Service imposed a full lockdown of the White House grounds and temporarily shut down Pennsylvania Avenue to traffic. By 11.56 am (local time), the security measures were lifted, and journalists were allowed back onto the North Lawn.Reporters had reassembled in the Palm Room by 12.20 pm (local time) before the US President Donald Trump’s scheduled departure for an event in Pennsylvania.The White House has not issued an official statement regarding the security breach as of yet.This is not the first instance of a security breach in the White House. Earlier this year a child had crawled his way through the fence of north lawn and tried to enter the White House. “Officers quickly reunited the child with their parents without incident,” said Anthony Guglielmi a Secret Service spokesperson, through a social media post.","The White House was temporarily put under lockdown on Tuesday after a “phone” was thrown over the security fence.

‘Could Spark World War III’: NATO Member Slams EU's Anti-Russia Sanctions As ‘Dangerous’





US President Donald Trump has said that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible” on Tuesday regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files as pressure from his MAGA supporters mount.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House, Trump said he received a briefing on the justice department and FBI review of the Epstein files. The briefing occurred prior to the release of the DOJ and FBI memo last week.The review found no evidence that Epstein maintained a “client list” of associates, and no additional charges are expected. As part of the investigation, the department also released several hours of footage, which officials say further supports the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide while in custody in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019.A journalist from ABC news, Katherine Faulders had asked Trump regarding what Bondi informed him about the review ""specifically, did she tell you at all that your name appeared in the files?"" To which Trump responded ""No, no, she's -- she's given us just a very quick briefing.”""And in terms of the credibility of the different things that they've seen, and I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden -- and you know, we and we went through years of that with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, with all of the different things that we had to go through,"" he added.""We've gone through years of it, but she's handled it very well, and it's going to be up to her,"" Trump said, referring to Bondi. ""Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.""Trump is facing backlash from his MAGA base over how his administration has managed the release of the Epstein files. There have been calls for Bondi’s resignation to which she responded on Tuesday, ""I'm going to be here for as long as the president wants me here, and I believe he's made that crystal clear.""“Let Pam Bondi do her job-she’s great!” Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier urging for unity within the MAGA movement amid reignition of controversy over the Epstein files. “We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he wrote.""I was with [FBI] Director [Kash] Patel all morning and we are committed to keeping America safe, making America safe, working with our incredible partners at DEA, FBI, ATF, US Marshals to do everything we can to make America safe and that's what we're focused on,"" said Bondi addressing an event at the Drug Enforcement Administration, reports ABC.Earlier reports also suggested that Kash Patel, the director of FBI was frustrated with Bondi for not releasing more information related to the Epstein files and reportedly told associates he wanted her removed from her position.For years, Patel and Dan Bongino, the deputy director of FBI have suggested that more information ought to be revealed regarding the Epstein case.The FBI and DOJ had issued a joint memo earlier stating that Epstein had died by suicide and there was no “client list.”","President Donald Trump has said that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible” on Tuesday regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Pakistan to create new paramilitary force ahead of protests by Imran Khan’s party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-create-new-paramilitary-force-ahead-of-protests-by-imran-khans-party/articleshow/122480047.cms,"The announcement came after PTI party said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of Imran Khan’s arrest

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.
