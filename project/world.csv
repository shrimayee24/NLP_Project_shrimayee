General who rubbished Pakistan's N-sabre rattling passes away at 83,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/general-who-rubbished-pakistans-n-sabre-rattling-passes-away-at-83/articleshow/112635506.cms,"NEW DELHI: General Sundararajan Padmanabhan, who was the Army chief during the massive forward troop deployment on the western front with Pakistan under Operation Parakram , passed away in Chennai on Sunday night. He was 83.Widely regarded as a straight-talking cerebral officer, affectionately called ""Paddy"" in defence circles , Gen Padmanabhan had publicly rubbished Pakistan's nuclear sabre-rattling during Operation Parakram, which was launched after the terror attack on Parliament in December 2001.Asked how India would respond to a nuclear attack during the customary Army Day press conference in Jan 2002, General Padmanabhan said perpetrator would be punished so severely that its continuation thereafter in any form would be in doubt. To another question, he said, ""Yes, we are ready for a second strike"", adding that India had sufficient nuclear weapons.This led to a major flutter, both in South Block and across the globe. Though the 10-month-long Operation Parakram was later interpreted as an exercise in ""coercive diplomacy"" by the then Vajpayee govt to get Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism, it is also a fact that the two countries came close to war two times during that period.Gen Padmanabhan, who served as the 20th Army chief from October 2000 to Dec 2002, largely shunned the limelight after superannuation, refusing post-retirement sinecures.""He leaves behind a legacy of exemplary leadership to the nation. His legacy is marked by his commitment to the welfare of soldiers,"" the Army said on Monday. Commissioned into the Regiment of Artillery in December 1959, Gen Padmanabhan held key command, staff and instructional appointments during his career, which included the posts of director-general of military intelligence and the 15 Corps commander in Srinagar.","General Sundararajan Padmanabhan, who was the Army chief during the massive forward troop deployment on the western front with Pakistan under Operation Parakram, passed away in Chennai on Sunday night.

"Ties with Russia, Ukraine not a zero-sum game: India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-will-travel-to-ukraine-meet-zelenskyy-on-friday/articleshow/112635477.cms,"Modi in Kyiv but shift unlikely in Indian position

NEW DELHI: Ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s ""landmark and historic"" visit to Ukraine, the Indian government indicated Monday its position on the Russia-Ukraine war – that ensuring peace is possible only through dialogue and diplomacy and the involvement of both parties in any peace initiative – remains unchanged.Modi will undertake a 10-hour journey from Przemysl in Poland, on the border with Ukraine, to arrive in Kyiv on Friday for an 8-hour visit that will see him holding bilateral talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and also interacting with Indian students in Ukraine.Modi is likely to reiterate India’s position before Zelenskyy, who had described the Indian PM’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month as a devastating blow to peace efforts, that it’s ready to offer any assistance within its means for restoration of peace. The ""clear and consistent"" Indian position has seen it backing peace efforts with the caveat that these must involve Moscow too, but without coming up, unlike China, with any proposal of its own for political settlement or mediation.As foreign minister S Jaishankar said earlier this year, India is open to the role of a mediator if it’s approached, but it doesn’t want to initiate anything on its own. India has so far not condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine and has also not endorsed Zelenskyy’s 10-point peace plan.Asked about Modi’s ""balancing act"" and the apparent pressure from the West under which the visit is happening, MEA secretary (west) Tanmaya Lal said India has broad, substantive and independent ties with both Russia and Ukraine. ""This not a zero-sum game,"" he said. On Ukraine’s invasion of Russia’s Kursk region, the official reiterated India’s position for a solution through dialogue and diplomacy saying the same was shared by a vast majority of countries.""Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties and it can only be a negotiated settlement. India continues to engage with all stakeholders,"" he said, adding India is also ready to assist reconstruction efforts in Ukraine.The visit will also look at steps to expand bilateral cooperation, including through restoration of trade to the level it had reached before the war. Lal listed defence cooperation along with agriculture, health and education among the issues both sides will discuss but without sharing any detail about it. Zelenskyy’s office said a number of documents will be signed during the visit, the first by an Indian PM in the history of India-Ukraine relations.""Prime Minister’s engagements in Kyiv will touch a range of aspects of bilateral ties including political, trade, economic, investments, education, cultural, people-to-people exchanges, humanitarian assistance and others. PM will also interact with the Indian community, including students during the visit. PM’s landmark visit to Ukraine will help further consolidation and expansion of bilateral ties,"" said the Indian government in an official statement.On his way to Kyiv, Modi will also be in Poland on August 21-22 for what will be the first visit by an Indian PM to that country in 45 years. He will call on President Andrzej Sebastian Duda and hold bilateral talks with PM Donald Tusk, while also interacting with the Indian community in Poland.",PM Narendra Modi will arrive in Kyiv on Friday for an 8-hour visit that will see him holding bilateral talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"Narendra Modi to visit Ukraine on August 23, first visit by an Indian PM since bilateral ties began",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-visit-ukraine-for-the-first-time-since-war-with-russia/articleshow/112622815.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Ukraine on August 23, his first visit since the country's war with Russia. Modi's visit to Kyiv will be the first by an Indian PM since bilateral relations began over 30 years ago.Before Kyiv, PM Modi will be in Poland on August 21-22. He is expected to take a train from Poland to Kyiv. The PM's trip to Poland is also historic as it is the first such trip by an Indian PM to the country in 45 years.Tanmaya Lal, secretary west of ministry of external affairs (MEA), said: ""PM Narendra Modi will undertake an official visit to Ukraine later this week on Friday, August 23, on the invitation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy .This is also a landmark and a historic visit since this will be the first time an Indian PM will be visiting Ukraine in more than 30 years since we established our diplomatic relations. This visit will build upon the recent high-level interactions between the leaders.""The MEA further said that India has always been advocating diplomacy and dialogue to resolve conflict in Ukraine. ""India has maintained a very clear and consistent position that diplomacy and dialogue can resolve this conflict and which can lead to enduring peace, so dialogue is absolutely essential. Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties and it can only be a negotiated settlement. on our part, India continues to engage with all stakeholders,"" he said.""Prime Minister Modi has had conversations with leaders of both Russia and Ukraine as you know and the PM also visited Russia, recently. India is willing to provide all possible support and contribution required to help find peaceful solutions to this complex issue and at this stage, it is not for us to anticipate or prejudge what the outcome of these discussions will be between the leaders of India and Ukraine,"" Lal added.The Office of the Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also issued a statement: ""On August 23, the National Flag Day of Ukraine, PM Modi will pay an official visit to Ukraine. This is the first visit of an Indian PM to Ukraine in the history of our bilateral relations. During the visit, in particular, the talks with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be held to discuss issues of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. It is also expected that a number of documents between Ukraine and India will be signed.""The visit comes following criticism from Kyiv over PM Modi's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a recent visit. The visit to Poland and Ukraine signals PM Modi's attempt to navigate India's longstanding ties with Moscow alongside cultivating closer relations with Western nations.The trip also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned PM Modi for hugging Putin during his visit to Moscow in July, which happened just after a Russian attack on several Ukrainian cities caused significant casualties and damage.Modi's government has consistently called for peaceful dialogue to resolve the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, avoiding direct condemnation of Russia's actions. India and Russia share historical ties dating back to the Cold War, a period during which the Kremlin emerged as a major arms supplier to India.Since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict , Russia has emerged as a critical supplier of discounted crude oil to India. This has bolstered economic ties, helping India save billions of dollars while also aiding Russia economically despite Western sanctions.Western countries have encouraged India to distance itself from Russia while seeking to strengthen their own relations with New Delhi. India is part of the Quad grouping with the United States, Japan, and Australia, which serves as a counterbalance to China's increasing influence in the Asia-Pacific region.On the significance of PM Modi's visit to Poland, Chargé d’affaires of Poland to India Sebastian Domżalski said: ""I am very happy about PM Modi's visit to Poland. This is the first visit of the Indian PM to our country since 1979...This is a very significant visit of PM Modi and we are celebrating 70 years of India-Poland diplomatic relations...We will be looking forward to finding new avenues of cooperation...There will be three priority areas. Technology will be a very important priority area. Both countries are looking forward to upgrading their economies...Poland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union...Security will also be high on the agenda, given the situation in Europe and the global tensions that we are observing...The defence will also be discussed""","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Ukraine on August 23, his first visit since the country's war with Russia.

'Will she step down?': BJP hits out at Mamata after TMC neta's 'we will not save' doctors from public wrath remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-she-step-down-bjp-hits-out-at-mamata-after-tmc-netas-we-will-not-save-doctors-from-public-wrath-remark-kolkata-rape-murder/articleshow/112628788.cms,"'This is real fascism'



'Mamata Banerjee wants to destroy evidence'

NEW DELHI: As politics over the Kolkata rape-murder go up multiple notches with war of words erupting between the BJP and TMC, a statement by TMC MP warning doctors that “we will not save you” from public wrath, has added to the recent spate of tensions between the two parties.The BJP on Tuesday took strong exception to controversial statements made by TMC netas in support of Mamata Banerjee , who after the brutal rape-murder of the trainee doctor at a state run hospital, has come under fire from various quarters for handling of law and order situation in the state.“In the name of the movement, you may go home or go about with your boyfriend. If a patient dies because of your strike and public anger falls on you, we will not save you,” TMC MP Arup Chakraborthy was quoted as saying in a rally in West Bengal by media reports.The BJP was quick to pounce on the loose statement, with BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla likening ""TMC"" to ""Talibani Mindset & Culture"".""Any more evidence needed that Mamta Govt stands with the rapists not with the doctors, those crusading for justice or with the victim’s family. Will she step down? Will the MP be sacked?,"" he added.However, this is not the first time in recent week, a TMC politician's remark has drawn similar ire from the saffron party. Earlier on Sunday, TMC state minister Udayan set off a similar political storm by threatening to to ""break the fingers"" of those calling for chief minister Mamata Banerjee to step down amid protests over the PG trainee doctor's rape-murder in a state run hospital.The saffron party's spokesperson in an apparent reference to opposition attacking BJP over ""fascism"", chose to accuse the TMC of the same. ""This is real fascism,"" he said in the post on X.""Dictator Didi minister Udayan Guha who insulted & mocked Women’s 14th August midnight march now gives chilling warning 'If you point finger at CM, fingers will be broken', "" he added.Poonawala then went on to refer the recent developments in the state such as cancelling of the football match, violence against protesters by state police, the recent sacking of TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen for ""speaking on Sandip Ghosh"". This, he suggested are all elements of ""real fascism"". """"Kolkata police issues threat notices to citizens, summons doctors -football match cancelled to avoid protests - Shantanu Sen sacked as spokesperson for speaking on Sandip Ghosh, Sukhendu Roy summoned -Talibani order to transfer 43 doctors which was halted"", he listed his post.The saffron party's spokesperson then went ahead to refer the recent ""break your finger"" threat by the minister and said, ""Now open threats!""The BJP spokesperson also referred to the parents of the deceased, who have cried ""betrayal"" by the TMC government and have accused the state government of trying to protect the accused. ""Parents of victim have also spoken on how Mamata is suppressing the truth,"" the saffron party's spokesperson said.Earlier in the day, BJP's Gaurav Bhatia also held a press conference, where the spokesperson accused the West Bengal government of being ""hell bent"" to muddy the evidence and save the accused in the rape-murder case.Addressing the media, BJP's national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia demanded Mamata's resignation and said, ""Mamata Banerjee is the chief minister of West Bengal who also holds the Home Ministry and the Health Ministry.The main purpose of today's press conference is to demand her resignation and justice for our sister, who was brutally raped and murdered. Mamata Banerjee should resign.""""A chief minister, through her deeds or inactions acts of commission or omission, destroyed the evidence which is vital to ensure that the accused get the punishment they deserve and as per the new criminal law. destroyer is hell-bent on destroying the evidence"" he added.Kolkata Police summoned TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy on Sunday, hours after he demanded that the CBI interrogate Kolkata Police commissioner and former principal of Kar Medical College and Hospital.Kolkata Police also issued summonses to former BJP MP Locket Chatterjee and two well known doctors for allegedly spreading rumours and disclosing the identity of the woman doctor who was raped and murdered at R G Kar Medical College.","The BJP on Tuesday took strong exception to controversial statements made by TMC netas in support of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

Kolkata doctor death: Who is Sanjay Roy? Civic volunteer arrested in RG Kar Hospital rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-doctor-death-who-is-sanjay-roy-civic-volunteer-arrested-in-rg-kar-hospital-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112440685.cms,"Sanjay Roy (In middle) was taken into custody on Saturday

Who is Sanjay Roy?

Roy joined Kolkata Police’s Disaster Management Group as a civic volunteer in 2019 but used “the right channels” to shift to Kolkata Police’s Welfare Cell.

He reportedly used “connections” to live on the premises of KP’s 4th Battalion. This association helped him get posted at RG Kar Hospital.

Hospital. Roy had been assigned to the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital on several occasions, sometimes for extended periods, granting him easy access to all hospital departments.

What are his position and entitlements?

It has come to light that Roy is a member of the Police Welfare Board’s 14-member central committee, and his 'disapproval' could lead to the transfer of police officers.

Roy received 5 liters of free fuel daily to use a police motorcycle for personal purposes. The motorcycle, which had a police sticker, was seized on Monday.

The bike Sanjay Roy used to ride had a police sticker on it

What are the allegations against him?

A police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women.

He was found guilty on at least two occasions—first for assaulting his pregnant wife in 2022, and later for misbehaving with a female doctor a few weeks ago—but he was never censured. He managed to evade capture even after assaulting his pregnant wife.

On Monday, a woman went to Lalbazar to report that Roy had been harassing her by phone for the past three months. He first approached her at RG Kar Hospital under the pretext of buying medicine, obtained her number from the prescription, and has since pressured and threatened her to meet.

Another complaint against Roy concerns police transfers. An officer suspects that his significant “influence” may have played an active role in at least six transfers from the Tala police station and Shyambazar police outpost in recent weeks.

A torn earphone discovered in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building, where the young doctor's body was found on Friday, led to his identification.

discovered in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building, where the young doctor's body was found on Friday, led to his identification. CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.

What happened at RG Kar on Friday?

Post-midnight, deceased doctor and four colleagues ordered food and had dinner in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver.

After the meal, her colleagues departed, and she remained in the room to continue her studies. She handed over her duties to colleagues, and went to the seminar hall to study. At around 2 am, someone from the hospital visited her in the seminar hall to discuss a patient’s treatment.

Police said that around the same time, she had received a message from her cousin and replied at 2.35 am, saying everything was ""normal"" till then. Before 3 am, a hospital staff member found her lying under a red blanket in the seminar hall. It is assumed that the accused, Sanjay, entered the seminar hall after that.

At 3am, she was seen sleeping in the room.

Around 4am, the accused entered the seminar room, sexually assaulted her. When she attempted to resist, the perpetrator throttled her.

The woman's broken glasses were found next to her laptop, suggesting that she fought her attacker for a considerable time, trying to defend herself.

Her eyes had blood clots from being throttled. Reports indicate that the accused covered her mouth forcefully and slammed her head against the wall, causing injuries to her face. While her thyroid cartilage was not fractured, it did have a blood clot, suggesting the attacker pressed hard to prevent her from escaping. Nail marks on her face indicate she tried to scream but was silenced.

The next morning, when her body was found at 7.30am, her mask was discovered a short distance away. A closed laptop was found near her head, with a diary and her mobile phone placed on top of it. A plastic water bottle was found overturned next to her head.

What is the sequence of events?

9.30 am: The Assistant Superintendent calls the victim’s parents and reports the incident as a suicide.

10.10 am: The Inspector-in-Charge of the R.G. Kar police outpost is alerted.

10.30 am: Tala Police Station sends an alert to CP, DCP, JCP, and addl CP.

11.30 am: Police officers up to the rank of additional CP arrive at the scene.

1.00 pm: The victim’s parents arrive, and a forensic team examines the seminar room, the crime scene. The parents claim they are initially denied access.

1.10 pm: The parents are granted access to the seminar room. Students identify the body, and a cloth partition is put up.

3.55 pm: The victim’s father requests an inquest by a judicial magistrate.

4.20 pm: The judicial magistrate arrives, conducts a videographed inquest, and the woman’s mother signs the inquest report.

5.30 pm: The body is taken out for an autopsy.

6.10 pm to 7.10 pm: The autopsy is completed.

What does the autopsy say?

The official postmortem report late on Friday also confirmed sexual assault on the 31-year-old doctor.

on the 31-year-old doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

What are recent developments in CBI investigation into Sanjay Roy?

Hours after the CBI registered an FIR in the RG Kar rape-murder case in New Delhi, the agency took custody of the prime accused, Sanjay Roy. He was subjected to a medical examination and began questioning at the CBI's CGO Complex office.

The process was marked by considerable drama. When CBI officials attempted to transport Roy for his medical check-up at ESI Joka in the afternoon, they encountered difficulties. The prison van had to turn back midway due to ongoing protests by doctors at ESI Joka, which posed a safety concern. Roy was initially taken to Command Hospital, but they were unable to conduct the examination there. The examination was eventually completed at BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah.

On Thursday, the victim’s parents informed the CBI that they suspected Sanjay Roy was not the primary perpetrator but was acting under the influence of others. They expressed their belief that the case involved gang rape and alleged a deliberate attempt to cover up the crime by hospital authorities.

On Monday, the CBI received approval to conduct a polygraph test on the arrested civic volunteer , Sanjay Roy.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

MEERUT: The Allahabad high court has acquitted a man convicted of the attempted rape and murder of a 100-year-old woman seven years ago, overturning the trial court's life imprisonment sentence due to the ""lack of independent witnesses and the absence of confirmation of rape and murder in the medical report "". The incident took place in Meerut on Oct 29, 2017, and the high court's verdict came on Aug 13 this year.Ankit Punia, who was 24 years old at the time of the crime, had been sentenced to life imprisonment by a special court on Nov 20, 2020.The charges against him included trespassing, attempted rape, and murder, with the prosecution alleging that the woman, too frail to resist, was assaulted and later died in the hospital. A case was filed under several sections, including those under the SC/ST Act . Justices Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Gautam Chaudhary heard Punia's appeal, which argued that the case was fabricated. Punia's lawyer, Arun Deshwal, told the court that the woman's grandson had falsely implicated Punia to avoid repaying a loan and gain financial assistance from govt.""The plaintiff has admitted in his statements that he was living in Ghaziabad with his wife at the time of the incident, and he cannot be an eyewitness, and consequently, his statements cannot be believed,"" Deshwal argued.

"Obama, Clinton and... Deja Foxx? Influencers pitch Kamala Harris at DNC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obama-clinton-and-deja-foxx-influencers-pitch-kamala-harris-at-dnc/articleshow/112640480.cms,"Chartreuse green. Coconut trees. Venn diagrams. They’re motifs of a “brat” summer that has memed Kamala Harris into a narrow but perceptible lead against the master of social media — Donald Trump.Now, as she prepares to be coronated as her party’s nominee in a presidential campaign dominated more by vibes than policy, Harris needs to keep the momentum going.So she is turning to about 200 social-media influencers, who for the first time ever have received privileges such as access to delegates and studio space at the Democratic National Convention.It’s a reflection of the campaign’s belief that social media creators are at least as important as traditional media organizations for getting its message to voters. What’s more, some of them — not bound by journalistic doctrine against the appearance of bias — will even make speeches at the DNC in Chicago to rally support for Harris.Monday night will feature Deja Foxx , a Columbia University graduate whose website describes her as an activist “leading thought at the intersection of social justice and social media.” She is focused on reproductive rights, an issue that has given Democrats ammunition against the Republicans after a conservative majority in the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion protections.“I will be the first creator to speak at the DNC tonight,” Foxx, who has almost 140,000 followers on TikTok and about 52,000 followers on Instagram, said in a video posted on Monday. “This is a dream, realized.” On Sunday, after arriving in Chicago for the convention, she posted two “outfit check” videos in which she sported a Stella McCartney dress that she said she’d bought secondhand and a “vintage 2020 primaries Kamala tee” featuring a childhood picture of Harris in pigtails.Foxx, who worked on Harris’ failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is now based in Arizona, where polls show a tight presidential race. Republicans are pushing border security where they sense Harris could be vulnerable, but face their own challenges on reproductive rights. An amendment to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s constitution will be on the ballot in November, which could fuel Democratic turnout.Apart from Foxx, four other influencers — Olivia Julianna, Carlos Eduardo Espina, Nabela Noor and John Russell — will speak at the DNC this week, according to a person familiar with the matter. They’ll share the same stage reserved for Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, as well as the most powerful Democrats, including Barack Obama , Nancy Pelosi and Bill and Hillary Clinton.Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar celebrated the Democratic party ’s recent success on social media, particularly compared with former president Trump's past dominance. “One of the frustrations for us and our party is that these guys just captured the Internet,” she told a group of New York delegates at the DNC on Monday morning. “Not this time.”Klobuchar highlighted the surfacing of controversial comments made by Trump running mate JD Vance disparaging “childless cat ladies,'' sparking blowback not just from Democrats but also some Republicans.“When we found that video on cat ladies, the cat ladies of the country united,” she said. “When they go after Kamala for coconut trees, there’s coconut memes, there’s brat summer, there’s her laugh set to Zoom music. We have taken this back.”Though Vance clarified that he was criticizing the Democratic Party for “becoming anti-family and anti-child,” rather than targeting people who couldn’t have kids, his original remarks have contributed to a view that the GOP ticket is adversarial to women. The influencer Noor, set to speak on Tuesday at the DNC and whose social media feeds feature everything from recipes to makeup tips and travelogues, has spoken passionately on her YouTube channel, where she has over 1 million followers, about the challenges she and her husband faced in conceiving a child.While that’s likely to resonate with Democratic diehards at the DNC, a pinned video on her TikTok account also provides a window into a challenge the Democrats are contending with among the Gen Z crowd. Noor speaks about why she deleted an earlier post expressing “compassion for the innocent civilians” affected by the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, a militant group designated a terrorist organization by the US and European Union.“I just assumed that all of my followers knew of my past posts and support for the Palestinian cause in the past year,” she said in the video, while simultaneously applying makeup. “If I could do one thing differently, it would be to be even clearer about my support for the Palestinian movement for peace and freedom while still sharing my sympathy of course for Israeli civilians.”The elevation of influencers like Noor is the party’s attempt to capture the attention of young voters, a core component of the Democratic base that was unenthusiastic about Biden’s bid for reelection. Since his exit from the race, they’ve warmed to Harris, but some of them are still skeptical of the vice president's response to the Israel-Hamas war.Noor’s video clarifying her views on the conflict shows how the turmoil in Gaza continues to be the biggest and most divisive issue driving many young Democrats to turn on the party. Harris has adopted a more sympathetic tone than Biden toward the plight of Palestinians, but her refusal to disavow Israel — which has been bombarding Gaza as part of its stated goal of eliminating Hamas — has angered the activists.Chicago has been bracing for protests over the conflict after pro-Palestinian groups planned mass demonstrations urging followers to “Shut Down the DNC for Gaza!”. Through Monday afternoon, thousands of demonstrators have marched the city’s streets.Harris has also faced off against protesters during her campaign. “Kamala, Kamala you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide,” a group of them yelled at a rally in Detroit earlier this month. The visibly annoyed vice president responded: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”Among the other influencers scheduled to speak at the convention, Espina is the most popular on TikTok, with over 10 million followers on the platform. His focus is immigration, among the top concerns for voters in this election cycle and a cudgel that Trump and the GOP frequently pick up to attack Democrats.It’s a vulnerability for Harris in particular. Republicans have seized on the vice president’s portfolio that included addressing the root causes of migration.Espina, 25, makes videos targeted toward uplifting the immigrant community. Earlier in the summer, he filmed a video with Biden after the president announced a policy that looks to expand options for certain undocumented individuals and some spouses of US citizens. In a more recent video, he filmed himself in Chicago, saying he was “in the middle of the action” to keep his audience informed.“There should be no wrong door for engaging with voters,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at an event on Monday. “We’re speaking to them about the issues that matter most, and I’ve been really impressed, starting with brat summer to the work that’s going on now online. It's been very, very impressive. I’m someone who really enjoys communicating with my fellow Pennsylvanians on Tiktok, Instagram, wherever. It is really important to meet people where they are.”","Kamala Harris is turning to about 200 social-media influencers.

Al-Jabri, a former Saudi intelligence official who lives in exile in Canada, has been a yearslong dispute with the kingdom as his two children have been imprisoned in case he describes as trying to lure him back to Saudi Arabia.The allegation comes as Prince Mohammed now serves as the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, often meeting leaders in place of his father, the 88-year-old King Salman. His assertive behavior, particularly at the start of his ascension to power around the beginning of the Yemen war in 2015, extended to a wider crackdown on any perceived dissent or power base that could challenge his rule.In al-Jabri's remarks to the BBC, he said a ""credible, reliable"" official linked to the Saudi Interior Ministry confirmed to him that Prince Mohammed signed the royal decree declaring war in place of his father.""We were surprised that there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions,"" al-Jabri told the BBC. ""He forged the signature of his dad for that royal decree. The king's mental capacity was deteriorating.""A US-based lawyer for al-Jabri did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Yemen war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, launched with promises by the prince it would quickly be over, has ground on for nearly a decade. The war has killed more than 150,000 people and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. Prince Mohammed was the defense minister at the time.The Houthis also since the start the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip have launched attacks on shipping that have disrupted traffic through the Red Sea - and led to the most intense combat faced by the U.S. Navy since World War II.Al-Jabri once worked for former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a trusted confidant of the U.S. in the battle against al-Qaida militants in the kingdom after the September 11, 2001, attacks. King Salman replaced the crown prince for his son in 2017 and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef is believed to have been held under house arrest after.Al-Jabri had sued Prince Mohammed bin Salman in US federal court, alleging the crown prince sought to have him killed after he fled abroad.Speaking to the BBC, al-Jabri again alleged Prince Mohammed considered assassinating former King Abdullah with a poison ring from Russia - something he claimed in a 2021 interview with CBS News. He also described his fears that the crown prince still wanted him killed as his children remain imprisoned in the kingdom.""He planned for my assassination,"" al-Jabri told the BBC. ""He will not rest until he sees me dead. I have no doubt about that.""","Saad al-Jabri claims Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman forged his father's signature.

Republicans launch Biden impeachment report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republicans-launch-biden-impeachment-report-without-proof/articleshow/112639508.cms,"WASHINGTON: Congressional Republicans lodged a formal case Monday for the impeachment of US President Joe Biden , using the opening day of the Democratic National Convention to launch a political assault unlikely to gain serious traction.The report from three powerful committees in the Republican-led House of Representatives accuses Biden of corruption linked to his son Hunter 's foreign business affairs.Jim Jordan, head of the Judiciary committee, said the probe showed ""conclusively"" that Biden had ""abused his public office for the private financial benefit of the Biden family and Biden business associates.""""President Biden's legacy is marked by abuse of public office, corruption and obstruction. The evidence produced by our impeachment inquiry is the strongest case for impeachment of a sitting president the House of Representatives has ever investigated,"" said James Comer, head of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.However, there is no proof that Biden ever used his office to benefit his son or was involved in Hunter's businesses. There was no smoking gun in a document built around inferences and innuendo about connections between father and son.Biden -- set to deliver a swan song speech at the Democratic convention and pass the political torch to his vice president Kamala Harris -- has repeatedly denied helping his son's business ventures, including in Ukraine and China.Republicans have for years used Hunter Biden's foreign links and chaotic personal life as a recovering drug addict to try and embarrass the president.However, marathon attempts to build an impeachment case against Biden -- seen by many as a bid for revenge over the two impeachments of Republican Donald Trump when he was president -- have never come close to an actual vote by the House.Republicans hold only a razor-thin majority and would likely fail to remain unanimous on impeaching Biden, risking severe embarrassment.",Congressional Republicans lodged a formal case for the impeachment of US President Joe Biden.

Blinken: Bibi has agreed to mediators’ truce proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/blinken-bibi-has-agreed-to-mediators-truce-proposal/articleshow/112639476.cms,"JERUSALEM: Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel had accepted a Biden administration proposal to bridge some remaining differences with Hamas on a cease-fire deal, as he pushed what he called ""probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity"" to secure a truce and free the remaining hostages in the Gaza Strip.Blinken made the declaration after a nearly three-hour meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem.""In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal -- that he supports it,"" Blinken told reporters. ""It's now incumbent on Hamas to do the same.""The statement put new pressure on Hamas, whose officials have called the proposal fundamentally slanted toward Israel, although the details have not been publicized.Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, said in a televised interview Monday with Al Jazeera that Hamas had broadly accepted a framework for a cease-fire outlined by President Joe Biden in late May. But he accused Netanyahu of introducing new conditions to that proposal and said Israeli officials had conceded nothing on key issues during a round of talks in Doha, Qatar , last week.""If the US administration was serious, we wouldn't need more negotiations -- only to implement Biden's proposal,"" Hamdan said.Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the meeting with Blinken had been ""positive"" and that the prime minister had ""reiterated Israel's commitment to the current American proposal on the release of our hostages, which takes into account Israel's security needs, which he strongly insists on.""But Netanyahu, in his own videotaped remarks, focused mostly on Iran and its allied militias.""I greatly appreciate the efforts that the US is making in regional defense against the Iranian axis,"" he said. ""This is important, of course, for the state of Israel."" He added, ""I also greatly appreciate the understanding that the US has shown for our vital security interests as part of our joint efforts to bring about the release of our hostages.""Despite the upbeat tone, some Israeli officials privately expressed skepticism that the US proposal would result in a breakthrough with Hamas.Negotiations intended to finalize a deal were expected to resume in Egypt this week, after two days of high-level talks in Qatar ended on Friday without an immediate breakthrough. During last week's talks, the United States, with the support of Egypt and Qatar, offered the bridging proposal to resolve some of the remaining differences between Hamas and Israel and avert a wider regional war.Blinken called it ""a decisive moment"" in the monthslong push for a cease-fire in Gaza.The talks have taken on added significance since an explosion on July 31 in Tehran, widely attributed to Israel, killed Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, after he attended the inauguration of Iran's new president. Hours earlier, an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut killed Fouad Shukur, a senior commander of Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese militia that, like Hamas, is backed by Iran.Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to retaliate for the killings, and Israel has said it will respond powerfully to any attack on its territory, raising the specter of an escalating regional conflict.Blinken and other mediators have not described what is contained in the bridging proposal. But US officials have said it aligns with a cease-fire framework that Biden outlined May 31 and that was later endorsed by the UN Security Council.Under that three-phase plan, Hamas and its allies would free the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The deal would eventually lead to the ""cessation of hostilities permanently"" and the rebuilding of Gaza.It remained unclear how Israel and Hamas would resolve their remaining differences. Among other points of contention, Netanyahu has sought to have Israeli troops patrol the Gaza side of the territory's border with Egypt to prevent Hamas from rearming during a cease-fire. Hamas has said it will not agree to any deal that does not involve the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.Hamas did not participate directly in last week's cease-fire talks in Qatar and has expressed deep frustration with the negotiations. On Sunday, the group said it had been briefed on the talks by mediators and ""we once again came to the conclusion that Netanyahu is still putting obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement, and is setting new conditions and demands with the aim of undermining the mediators' efforts and prolonging the war.""Blinken acknowledged Monday that the deal had not been finalized. He said, ""The next important step is for Hamas to say yes, and then in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together"" to work on ways to carry out the agreement.""These are still complex issues, and they're going to require hard decisions by the leaders,"" Blinken added. ""Ultimately, it comes down to those decisions. But there is, I think, a real sense of urgency here across the region on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible.""Blinken also met with Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, and its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as with relatives of the hostages in Gaza. The families have been pressuring Netanyahu to agree to a deal that would free those who were kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.""We continue to urge all parties involved to sign an agreement as soon as possible,"" the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement after its members met with Blinken. ""We cannot afford to waste this critical opportunity, which may be the last opportunity; time is running out for the hostages.""As diplomats hoped a cease-fire in Gaza, or even the prospect of one, might persuade Iran to hold off or blunt its anticipated attack on Israel, Blinken offered an indirect warning to Tehran and Hezbollah.""It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process,"" he said. ""And so we're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line -- or for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places and to greater intensity.""Hostilities between Israel and Hamas, meanwhile, have continued.Hamas' military wing and its ally, Islamic Jihad, took responsibility Monday for what they said was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on Sunday night. The Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency said that a ""powerful explosive"" had detonated on a road in southern Tel Aviv. One passerby was injured, they said.On Sunday, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian journalist, Ibrahim Muhareb, bringing the total number of Palestinian journalists and news media workers killed since Oct. 7 to at least 123, according to the International Federation of Journalists.The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate said that Israeli tank fire had struck Muhareb and a group of his colleagues while they were wearing gear identifying them as press near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.At least 25 people have been killed by Israeli fire in central and southern Gaza since Sunday, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense.

Harris super PAC founder says public polls are too optimistic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-super-pac-founder-says-public-polls-are-too-optimistic/articleshow/112639146.cms,"CHICAGO: The founder of the main outside spending group backing Kamala Harris ' presidential bid says their own opinion polling is less ""rosy"" than public polls suggest and warned that Democrats face much closer races in key states.Chauncey McLean , president of Future Forward , a super political action committee, or super PAC, that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to back Harris in the November 5 election, spoke on Monday during an event hosted by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.""Our numbers are much less rosy than what you're seeing in the public,"" said McLean, who rarely talks publicly.Harris enters the Democratic National Convention in Chicago riding a wave of public polls that show she has already reshaped a race that strongly favored Republican Donald Trump in the final weeks of President Joe Biden's candidacy. Harris is leading in a compilation of national polls by FiveThirtyEight 46.6% to 43.8% for Republican Donald Trump, and has pulled ahead in several public battleground state polls.Future Forward has created a massive polling operation that created and tested some 500 digital and television ads for Biden and some 200 for Harris. They have talked to some 375,000 Americans in the weeks after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee on July 22.McLean said the group has at least $250 million left to spend, planning a wave of advertising from digital to television between Labor Day on September 2 and Election Day on November 5.Super PACs can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited amounts to overtly advocate for or against political candidates.McLean said the majority of Harris' momentum in the immediate aftermath of Biden dropping out was from young voters of color, and that has opened up Sunbelt states such as Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, states which Democrats had largely written off in the final days of the Biden campaign.""She has multiple paths,"" with seven states in play, a complete turnaround from when Biden was on the ticket, he said. The other states include Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.McLean said Pennsylvania remains the most consequential state in the group's analysis and he called the race a ""coin flip"" based on its polls. He says Harris must win one of three states - Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Georgia - to win the White House.He warned that Harris has yet to fully rebuild the Biden coalition of Blacks, Hispanics and young voters that brought him the White House in 2020.McLean said polling shows the public wants more detailed policy positions from Harris.He says they don't want ""white papers,"" but they also don't want platitudes. He says they need more concrete examples of how she may differ from Biden and make their lives easier economically. Trump allies have called on Harris to do the same in recent days, hoping to pin her down on controversial issues.The race is as tight as ever, McLean said.""We have it tight as a tick, and pretty much across the board,"" he said.","Chauncey McLean is president of Future Forward, a super political action committee, or super PAC, that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to back Kamala Harris.

China claims Philippine ship ignored warnings and 'intentionally collided' in South China Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-claims-philippine-ship-ignored-warnings-and-intentionally-collided-in-south-china-sea/articleshow/112616086.cms,"Philippines says South China Sea actions not provocative

China's Coast Guard accused a Philippine vessel of "" deliberately colliding "" with a Chinese vessel in a "" dangerous and unprofessional "" manner in the disputed South China Sea . The clash occurred around 3:24 am local time on Monday, with a short video posted by the China Coast Guard on social media capturing the incident.According to China's maritime security statements, the Philippine vessel, which had previously been warned, entered waters near Second Thomas Shoal after being blocked from Sabina Shoal.Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, claimed that two Philippine Coast Guard vessels ""illegally intruded"" into the area around Sabina Shoal early Monday.Gan criticized the Philippines for ""provoking and causing trouble,"" and for violating agreements related to supply missions to a vessel grounded at Second Thomas Shoal. He warned that the Philippines should ""immediately stop infringement and provocation"" or face ""all consequences.""The Philippines' actions to assert its rights in the South China Sea are not provocative, Jonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the country's security council, said on Monday.The incident follows a provisional agreement reached in July between China and the Philippines to address repeated altercations near Second Thomas Shoal.China's aggressive stance, including blocking Philippine resupply efforts to a navy ship intentionally grounded 25 years ago, has faced sharp criticism from Western nations. Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, including both Sabina and Second Thomas Shoals, and rejects a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that deemed its expansive claims invalid under international law.","China's Coast Guard accused a Philippine vessel of "" deliberately colliding "" with a Chinese vessel in the disputed South China Sea.

"Iran responsible for hacks targeting Trump, Biden-Harris campaigns: US intel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iran-responsible-for-hacks-targeting-trump-biden-harris-campaigns-us-intel/articleshow/112639220.cms,"US intelligence officials attributed the hacking of Donald Trump 's presidential campaign to Iran , describing this intrusion as part of Tehran 's broader effort to interfere in American politics.This marks the first time the US government has blamed Iran specifically for election-related hacking.The FBI and other federal agencies revealed that besides breaching the Trump campaign, Iran is believed to have attempted to hack into Kamala Harris 's presidential campaign, according to reports by Associated Press.The federal officials indicated Iran's goal was to sow discord, undermine faith in democratic institutions, and influence the outcome of the election, especially those perceived by Iran as significant to its national security interests. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” said the statement released by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.Iran’s mission to the United Nations has denied the allegations, asserting that Iran had neither the motive nor intention to interfere with the election and challenged the US to provide evidence.This statement comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, particularly regarding the US's efforts to prevent a retaliatory strike on Israel over the assassination of Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh. An Israeli operation in southern Beirut last month resulted in the death of Hezbollah's top commander. Although Tehran and Iran-backed Hezbollah have vowed retaliation, no strikes have occurred as diplomatic efforts and Gaza cease-fire talks continue in Qatar.The US did not detail its methods for concluding that Iran was responsible for the hacks or describe the specific nature of any information obtained from the Trump campaign. However, the statement indicated that the intelligence community is confident that Iran has sought access to individuals with direct involvement in both political parties' presidential campaigns through social engineering and other means.At least three staffers from the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, though investigators have found no evidence of a successful breach, as reported by The Associated Press last week.“Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world,” the statement continued.The Trump campaign, on August 10, disclosed that it had been hacked, noting that Iranian operatives had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. Confidential material, including a report vetting JD Vance as a vice-presidential candidate, ended up being leaked to news outlets such as Politico, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. So far, these outlets have refused to reveal specific details of what they received. The incident allegedly encompassed the unauthorized acquisition of confidential files, which included documents pertaining to the assessment of Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance which were later disseminated to members of the press.Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign disclosed last week that the FBI had informed them last month of attempted hackings ""In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation,"" a Harris campaign official told AFP. However, the campaign added, ""We have robust cybersecurity measures in place and are not aware of any security breaches from these efforts.""In early October, Microsoft issued a report outlining foreign agents' attempts to meddle in this year's election. It mentioned an instance where an Iranian military intelligence unit sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign through a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.Additionally, Google reported that an Iranian group linked to the country's Revolutionary Guard has attempted to infiltrate the personal email accounts of approximately a dozen individuals associated with President Joe Biden and Trump since May.","The FBI and other federal agencies revealed that besides breaching the Trump campaign, Iran is believed to have attempted to hack into Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.

We are forever grateful to you.""""Let us fight for the ideals we hold dear, and let us always remember, when we fight, we win!,"" Harris said.Biden stepped aside from the presidential race last month, a move influenced by concerns of fellow party leaders about the 81-year-old incumbent’s age and ability to serve another term.In his address, President Biden is set to discuss the achievements of his administration and endorse Kamala's run against Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump.Traditionally, the convention features a roll call vote to officially nominate the presidential and vice-presidential candidates.

Thousands marched to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza, with some demonstrators causing minor disturbances.As the main group of protesters marched, a few dozen broke away, tearing down pieces of the security fence near the United Center, where the convention is being held, AP reported.Several protesters, dressed in black with their faces covered, dragged portions of the fence back to a nearby park. Police detained and handcuffed several protesters who managed to get through the fence. Authorities confirmed that the inner security perimeter surrounding the convention site was not breached, assuring no threat to the attendees.Chants of “End the occupation now” and “The whole world is watching!” were heard, which notably resonated with echoes of the 1968 anti-Vietnam War protests in Chicago. During those protests, police clashed with demonstrators on live television.On Monday, officers prepared by putting on gas masks while some protesters attempted to bring down a second fence set up in front of the police.The march occurred as President Joe Biden conducted a walk-through of the largely empty United Center. Biden, who has faced intense criticism from pro-Palestinian groups, was scheduled to address the party in the evening.“Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide,” chanted the marchers amid drum beats. They also referred to him as “Genocide Joe” and directed similar chants atVice President Kamala Harris .Protesters maintained that their plans remained unchanged since Biden left the race, with the party quickly rallying behind Harris, who is set to accept the Democratic nomination this week. Activists expressed their intent to amplify their progressive message before the nation’s top Democratic leaders.“We have to play our part in the belly of the beast to stop the genocide, to end US aid to Israel and stand with Palestine,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC , which includes hundreds of organisations.The march saw a heavy police presence, including Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling, who walked with a group of officers ahead of the protesters. Mayor Brandon Johnson stated that authorities were well-prepared for the event.“The city of Chicago is really good at things like this,” Johnson said at a news conference. “We are ready.”Organisers had hoped for at least 20,000 participants in Monday’s rally and march but only a few thousand appeared to be present at the march’s start. Although the city officials declined to provide a crowd estimate.","Protesters broke through a police-secured fence near the site of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.
