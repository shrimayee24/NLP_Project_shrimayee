Jammu pilgrim bus attack suggests new areas on terrorists’ radar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/pilgrims-killed-injured-as-bus-falls-into-gorge-after-terrorist-attack-in-jks-reasi/articleshow/110853516.cms,"JAMMU: At least ten pilgrims were killed and over 30 others injured when their bus plunged into a gorge following a terrorist ambush near Teryath village in Reasi district of J&K around 6pm Sunday, police reported.“The identities of the dead and injured have not yet been confirmed, but it is believed that the pilgrims are from Uttar Pradesh,” Reasi SSP Mohita Sharma said. A survivor named Santosh from UP confirmed that many of the passengers were from his state.The bus was returning from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Katra, a town known for the Vaishno Devi temple. It was travelling on a link road of NH144A, winding through thick forests and mountainous terrain.“Prima facie, it appears terrorists were waiting for the bus,” SSP Sharma said. “The driver was hit by gunfire and lost control of the vehicle,” the officer said, noting that bullet shells were found at the scene. The injured have been taken to hospitals in Teryath, Reasi, and Jammu.Local residents and authorities participated in the rescue operations, while a security sweep involving police, Army, and CRPF personnel was initiated to catch the attackers. The area, located 100km northwest of Jammu, has been cordoned off.Initial reports indicate that two masked terrorists opened fire on the bus, hitting the driver.According to 30-year-old Santosh, currently undergoing treatment in Reasi, a masked terrorist in military-style combat fatigue stood in the middle of the road and fired indiscriminately. “I could hear intermittent gunshots when the bus was rolling down the mountainside,” he said.Union minister Amit Shah condemned the attack and expressed his condolences, tweeting: “Deeply pained by the incident of the attack on pilgrims in Reasi, J&K. Spoke to the Lieutenant Governor and the DGP, J&K, and inquired about the incident. The culprits of this dastardly attack will not be spared and will face the wrath of the law.”Union minister Rajnath Singh called the attack on pilgrims “extremely reprehensible”. “My heart goes out to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in this heinous act against pilgrims. I also pray for the speedy recovery of the injured,” he tweeted.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi also expressed his condolences to the bereaved families. “This shameful incident is the true picture of the worrying security situation in Jammu and Kashmir,” he tweeted.Sunday’s ambush suggests a spread of terrorist violence to new areas, as Reasi had remained unaffected by the recent spate of attacks in neighbouring Rajouri and Poonch districts. The Pir Panjal route, known for its arduous terrain, is frequently used by terrorists to infiltrate Jammu from the LoC in Poonch and Rajouri before moving towards Kashmir.Sources suspect the involvement of former Pakistani army SSG commando-turned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative Illiyas Fauji and two other terrorists from Pakistan, who have been on the run since the fatal attack on an IAF convoy in Poonch district on May 4.According to Union home ministry data, eight civilians were killed in J&K in the first five months of this year up to May 31.The last terrorist attack in Reasi was on May 13, 2022, when terrorists used “sticky bombs” on a bus carrying pilgrims from Katra to Jammu, resulting in four deaths and injuries to 13 others.Sunday’s attack is reminiscent of the July 10, 2017, assault on a bus carrying Amarnath pilgrims, in which seven were killed and 19 injured. On that occasion, the driver managed to save 52 passengers despite heavy gunfire.","The bus was returning from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Katra, a town known for the Vaishno Devi temple.

New government to decide on Army's integrated battle group plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-government-to-decide-on-armys-integrated-battle-group-plan/articleshow/110854869.cms,"NEW DELHI: Apart from the impending move to create unified tri-Service theatre commands , the new govt will also take a call on the long-pending restructuring of some Army formations into self-contained integrated battle groups (IBGs) that can mobilise fast and hit hard, sources said.The 12-lakh strong Army has already carved out two IBGs under the 9 'Pivot' Corps (headquarters in Yol) on western front with Pakistan under Phase-1 of the 'pilot project'. Five IBGs, in turn, have been created in 17 'Mountain Strike' Corps (Panagarh) in eastern one with China in Phase-2.""These integrated all-arms IBGs have been successfully war-gamed and validated in multiple exercises. Army HQ had earlier submitted the report on Phase-1 of 'IBG-isation' to defence ministry. But MoD has also asked for Phase-2 report before official GSL (government sanction letter) can be issued,"" a source told TOI.Army remains all gung-ho about the role of IBGs, which it believes will ensure a greater and swifter offensive punch. But it remains to be seen how exactly the IBG model dovetails into the three proposed theatre commands to be constituted for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean region.""Theatre commands constitute a strategic-level reform involving Army, IAF and Navy. IBG model is a tactical re-organisation within Army, which has already been delayed quite a bit. But since IBG-isation has some financial implications, a GSL is required,"" another source said.As reported by TOI earlier, a composite IBG will have 5,000-6,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units permanently deployed together. As of now, these units come together only during exercises or actual combat.In effect, much more agile IBGs will be larger than brigades (3,000 soldiers each) but smaller than divisions (12,000 soldiers each) and will be headed by Major-Generals. Each IBG is to be configured as per the threat perception, the type of terrain involved and the operational task to be executed.So, IBGs meant for China will revolve more around infantry, light artillery and light mechanised forces geared for mountain warfare, while those for Pakistan will be focused on main-battle tanks and heavy artillery due to the plains involved.The original plan was to first carve out 8-10 IBGs, then wait for them to settle down, and finally create more over the years. Overall, the Army has 14 corps (40,000 to 70,000 troops in each), with four of them being 'strike' or offensive formations.While the 17 Corps was raised with China in mind, the 1 Corps (Mathura) was also ""reoriented and equipped"" for the northern borders after the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh erupted in May 2020. The two Pakistan-specific strike corps are 2 Corps (Ambala) and 21 Corps (Bhopal).","The 12-lakh strong Army has already carved out two IBGs under the 9 'Pivot' Corps on western front with Pakistan under Phase-1 of the 'pilot project' Five IBGs, in turn, have been created in 17 'Mountain Strike' Corps (Panagarh) in eastern one with China in Phase-2.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110855018,imgsize-1770674,width-400,resizemode-4/110855018.jpg"

The five attacked were identified as Saurabh Sidh, Bablu alias Sandip Shankar Chavan, Pratik alias Pilya Patil, Ruturaj alias Deja Inamdar and Dipak Netaji Khot. They had battered Munna with a concrete and iron cover of a drainage hole.The prison department has initiated an internal inquiry and has decided to step up security, especially for the other four convicts of the 1993 Bombay serial bomb blast case.The police had requested custody of the five accused against whom various cases are under hearing in different courts. After getting permission from the courts, police took the inmates from the jail and produced them before a local court. The cops wanted permission to interrogate them for Munna's murder. The court agreed and granted eight days of police custody.A senior officer said while witness statements have already been recorded, the real motive of the murder will be known once the five accused are interrogated.

Security Plans: Modi 3.0: G20-like security plans in place for swearing-in ceremony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/modi-30-g20-like-security-plans-in-place-for-swearing-in-ceremony/articleshow/110777990.cms,"NEW DELHI: A security apparatus exactly like the G20 summit will be in place for the swearing-in ceremony likely to be held on June 9 , sources said on Thursday. A ground-to-air surveillance is being set up in coordination with the intelligence agencies and the armed forces to secure central Delhi. From using advance intrusion alert systems and posture detection mechanism to covert snipers — security forces are learnt to be using every resource possible to tackle what they said was another security nightmare.South Asian heads of govt have been invited to the oath ceremony and Bangladesh and Sri Lankan leaders have already confirmed their presence. There are three primary challenges for Delhi Police — security of hotels where heads of state and dignitaries will be staying being the prime concern. Four hotels — Taj, Maurya, Leela and Oberoi — are being brought under heavy security cover.Two other key security issues are the movement of their carcade and the security of the route between the hotel and the venue. Each dignitary will be given a call sign that will be disclosed on the morning of ceremony. This will be used for coordinating the movement of the carcade and their route to the Rashtrapati Bhawan and Kartavya Path.An elaborate brainstorming session was held at the Delhi Police headquarters on Thursday afternoon to discuss the nitty-gritty of the arrangements. According to a DCP-rank officer privy to the discussions, a decision to replicate the measures adopted during G20 was taken during the meeting. “This means that there will be venue commanders of DCP rank at each hotel where the foreign heads of state will stay. They will report to the zonal/vertical commanders of special commissioner ranks,” said the officer.While the intelligence sleuths are coordinating with their foreign counterparts — who will form the immediate security cordon of their respective dignitary — Delhi Police is working on the inputs conveyed to it in making the venues and routes foolproof. The threat perception of each foreign leader is being studied individually.The intrusion alert system and the posture detection will help cops filter out suspicious movements. “The advance AI-based cameras and software will raise alarm and alert security if a man or a woman is caught scaling the wall or shows unusual bodily movement like crawling or limp walking with a bent back,” explained an officer.The vetting and background check of hotel staffers is being undertaken by special branch and security unit and the verification reports prepared during G20 is also being studied again. There would be separate set of staffers for each floor and their movement will be contained to that floor of the hotel itself at all times.The cops and security personnel will have at least two rooms to themselves which will function as control rooms. While state borders will remain sealed during the ceremony, there will be extra vigil at malls, markets, monuments and places of worship by quick response teams, commando units, and strike forces with special vehicles.","South Asian heads of govt have been invited to the oath ceremony.

'New counteraction': North Korea sends 300 more trash balloons south,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/new-counteraction-north-korea-sends-300-more-trash-balloons-south/articleshow/110858851.cms,"Image credit: Agencies

NEW DELHI: North Korea sent over 310 more balloons filled with trash including scrap paper and plastic to south across the border overnight on Sunday following Kim Jong's sister warned of ""new counteraction "", news agency Yonhap reported quoting Seoul's military.

""The latest batch of waste-loaded balloons sent late Sunday contained scrap paper and plastic, with no toxic material detected so far,"" the joint chiefs of staff said adding that, as of early Monday morning, no more balloons had been seen floating in the sky.

The move came in retaliation to South Korea playing loudspeaker broadcasts as a form of 'psychological warfare' against North Korea.

""If the ROK simultaneously carries out the leaflet scattering and loudspeaker broadcasting provocation over the border, it will undoubtedly witness the new counteraction of the DPRK,"" Kim Jong Yo said as reported by news agency KCNA.

Terming it a ""psychological warfare"", Kim's sister said that South Korea would have to ""suffer a bitter embarrassment of picking up waste paper without rest and it will be its daily work"".

North Korea has been sending hundreds of balloons into the South in recent weeks, carrying trash like toilet paper and cigarette butts. The move come in retaliation to South floating balloons bearing pro-Pyongyang propaganda northward, which Seoul is legally unable to halt.

NEW DELHI: An Indian-origin man from Punjab's Ludhiana was shot dead in Surrey, Canada, in what authorities suspect to be a 'targeted shooting'. The victim, Yuvraj Goyal , 28, arrived in Canada in 2019 on a student visa and recently acquired Canadian Permanent Resident (PR) status. Goyal, who worked as a sales executive, was found dead after police responded to a shooting in the 900-block of 164 Street at 8:46 am on June 7.

Goyal's father, Rajesh Goyal, runs a firewood business, and his mother, Shakun Goyal, is a homemaker. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Yuvraj had no known criminal record. The motive behind his murder remains under investigation.

Four suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the incident. Manvir Basram, 23, Sahib Basra, 20, Harkirat Jhutty, 23, all from Surrey, and Keilon Francois, 20, from Ontario, have been charged with first-degree murder.

""Although initial evidence suggests this was a targeted shooting, investigators are working to determine the reason that Mr. Goyal, a 28-year old community member with no history of police contact, was killed,"" Sergeant Timothy Pierotti said.

In the official release Sgt. Timothy Pierotti said that, on June 8, 23-year old Manvir Basram of Surrey, 20-year old Sahib Basra of Surrey, 23-year old Harkirat Jhutty of Surrey, and 20-year old Keilon Francois of Ontario, were charged with first degree murder, in relation to the shooting of Yuvraj Goyal.

Sgt. Pierotti of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) praised the efforts of the Surrey RCMP and other emergency response teams, stating, ""We are thankful for the hard work of the Surrey RCMP, Air 1, and Lower Mainland Integrated Emergency Response Team (IERT), but there is still more work to be done. IHIT investigators remain dedicated to determining why Mr. Goyal was the victim of this homicide.""

US calls on Security Council to vote on backing Gaza ceasefire plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-calls-on-security-council-to-vote-on-backing-gaza-ceasefire-plan/articleshow/110858932.cms,"UNITED NATIONS : The United States announced Sunday it has requested a UN Security Council vote on its draft resolution backing a plan for an ""immediate ceasefire with the release of hostages "" between Israel and Hamas .Diplomatic sources said the vote is planned for Monday, but has not yet been confirmed by South Korea, which holds the Security Council presidency for the month of June.""Today, the United States called for the Security Council to move towards a vote... supporting the proposal on the table,"" said Nate Evans, spokesman for the US delegation, without specifying a vote date.""Council members should not let this opportunity pass by and must speak with one voice in support of this deal,"" Evans said.The United States, a staunch ally of Israel, has been widely criticized for having blocked several UN draft resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.US President Joe Biden on May 31 launched a new push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, separate from the United Nations.Under the proposal, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centers and Hamas would free hostages. The ceasefire would last an initial six weeks, with it extended as negotiators seek a permanent end to hostilities.The United States is placing primary responsibility for accepting the proposal on Hamas, specifically calling on the Palestinian militant group to accept the document in the latest version of the draft text.That version, which was distributed to member states on Sunday and was seen by AFP, ""welcomes"" the new ceasefire proposal while stating, unlike in previous versions, that Israel has already accepted.The draft resolution ""calls upon Hamas to also accept it, and urges both parties to fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.""In response to requests from several member states, the latest text clearly lays out the proposal.This includes a first phase with an ""immediate, full, and complete ceasefire,"" release of hostages taken by Hamas, and ""exchange of Palestinian prisoners"" plus ""withdrawal of Israeli forces from the populated areas in Gaza.""This also includes the ""safe and effective distribution of humanitarian assistance at scale throughout the Gaza Strip to all Palestinian civilians who need it.""- Member state disagreements -According to diplomatic sources, several Security Council members indicated their reservations on two previous versions of the text, in particular Algeria which is the Arab representative on the UN Security Council, and Russia which wields a veto.Since the unprecedented attack by Hamas on October 7 against Israel and Israel's subsequent counterattack, the Security Council has struggled to speak with one voice.Following two resolutions mainly focused on humanitarian aid, the Security Council finally at the end of March successfully demanded an ""immediate ceasefire"" for the duration of Ramadan, which was achieved with the United States abstaining from the vote.Following the International Court of Justice's decision at the end of May ordering Israel to stop its offensive in Rafah, Algeria circulated a draft resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire and, more specifically, a halt to the Rafah offensive.The United States, however, said such a text was not helpful, stating that it instead favored negotiations on the ground to achieve a ceasefire.The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,084 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.","U.S. has requested a UN Security Council vote on its draft resolution backing a plan for an ""immediate ceasefire with the release of hostages "" Under the proposal, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centers and Hamas would free hostages.

"UN food agency pauses its aid work at US pier in Gaza over security concerns, in latest setback",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/un-food-agency-pauses-its-aid-work-at-us-pier-in-gaza-over-security-concerns-in-latest-setback/articleshow/110858628.cms,"WASHINGTON : The director of the UN World Food Program said Sunday the programme has ""paused"" its distribution of humanitarian aid from an American-built pier off Gaza, saying she was ""concerned about the safety of our people"" after what had been one of the deadliest days of the war there. Saturday saw both an Israeli military assault that freed four hostages but left 274 Palestinians and one Israeli commando dead, and, Cindy McCain said, two of WFP's warehouses in Gaza had been ""rocketed"" and a staffer injured.Sunday's UN announcement of the pause appears the latest setback for the US sea route, set up to try to bring more aid to Gaza's starving people.The US Agency for International Development described the pause as a step to allow for a security review by the humanitarian community in Gaza. USAID works with the World Food Program and their humanitarian partners in Gaza to distribute food and other aid coming from the US-operated pier.Completed in mid-May, the US pier was operational for only about a week before being knocked offline by storm damage for two weeks. After repairs, it returned to operation again Saturday, bringing in 1.1 million pounds (492 metric tons) of food and other aid, before McCain said her agency was pausing its humanitarian work there.The UN agency gave no further details, including how long the pause would last. WFP spokespeople did not respond to requests for further details.Asked about the pier operation during an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" McCain said: ""Right now we're paused.""""I'm concerned about the safety of our people after the incident yesterday,"" McCain said, without elaboration. ""We also, two of our warehouses, the warehouse complex were rocketed yesterday.""""We've stepped back for the moment,"" she said, and want ""to make sure that we're on safe terms and on safe ground before we'll restart. But the rest of the country is operational. We're doing ... everything we can in the north and the south.""USAID said in a statement to The Associated Press that it was working with other US government officials and with humanitarian groups in Gaza ""to ensure that aid can safely and effectively resume movement following completion of the security review that the humanitarian community is currently undertaking.""President Joe Biden in March announced in his State of the Union address that he had directed the US military to set up the temporary pier. The US project was meant to bring in a limited amount of aid into Gaza, where Israeli restrictions on land crossings, and fighting, have brought more than 1 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people near the point of famine.Saturday's return to operation for the US pier project came the same day that Israel mounted a heavy air and ground assault that rescued four hostages, who had been taken by Hamas during the October 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza.Pushing back against social media claims after the Israeli military operation, US Central Command said in a tweet Saturday that neither the pier nor any of its equipment, personnel or other assets were used in the Israeli operation. It noted that Israel used an area south of the pier ""to safely return hostages.""A core principle of humanitarian groups holds that their work must be independent of the mission of combatants in a conflict zone, so as to keep aid operations and aid workers from becoming targets.USAID said in a separate statement Saturday that no humanitarian workers were involved in the Israeli operation.Speaking of the ""rocketing"" of the WFP warehouses, McCain said Sunday that one staffer was injured but ""everybody else is fine.""""That's why a cease-fire is necessary. That's why we need to stop this,"" so that aid from her program and other organizations can flow into Gaza ""at scale"".","UN World Food Program says it has ""paused"" aid distribution from US-built pier off Gaza.

Iran helicopter crash shows Tehran's reliance on an aging fleet as well as its challenges at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-helicopter-crash-shows-tehrans-reliance-on-an-aging-fleet-as-well-as-its-challenges-at-home/articleshow/110813054.cms,"DUBAI, By the time Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi boarded his window seat on a helicopter ferrying him, the foreign minister and six others, thick clouds already had begun forming around the mountaintops along the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Despite the worsening weather, the helicopter lifted off for a trip about 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest to a new oil pipeline near Tabriz.Within an hour, the Bell 212 helicopter had crashed into a cloud-covered mountainside.While the cause of the May 19 crash remains unknown, the sudden death of the hard-line protege of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei exposed the contradictions and challenges facing the country's Shiite theocracy.The Iranian military investigators probing the crash have previously faced international criticism over their report on troops shooting down a Ukrainian airliner in 2020. The hourslong desperate rescue attempt after the helicopter crash saw Tehran even reach out to the United States for help, just weeks after launching an unprecedented attack on Israel and as it enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. Even the type of helicopter that crashed links back to Iranian history, both before and after the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.""Iran is a culture of dualities,"" said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy who studies Iran's military. ""Some aspects, they seem so good and well-managed, well-oiled and very capable. ... In many levels, it's quite lacking.""Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash, largely ruling out possibilities rather than offering a suspected cause. They've rejected the possibility of an onboard ""explosion caused by sabotage"" or a ""cyberattack"" targeting the Bell 212, a two-blade, twin-engine helicopter more widely known as the Huey for its use by the US military in the Vietnam War.""The recorded conversations between the flight crew show that the last contact with the pilots up to the time of the incident and when they stopped responding lasted 69 seconds,"" the investigators said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. ""No emergency declaration was recorded during that time.""In conspiracy-minded Iran, some officials still insist foul play could have caused the crash. However, some other officials have begun to ask why the helicopter took off from the site of the new Giz Galasi Dam when the weather had started to turn.Mostafa Mirsalim, a member of the country's Expediency Council, wrote on the social platform X that he had asked prosecutors to ""address the mistakes that led to the loss of the president and his delegation,"" without elaborating.Abbas Abdi, a prominent journalist, also wrote on X that the flight path taken by Raisi's helicopter suggested the pilot didn't follow a standard Iranian practice of shadowing main roads in rural areas. That can both help navigation and provide a safe landing area in an emergency. Former Iranian Presidents Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abolhassan Banisadr both survived helicopter crashes while in office.The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant in Montreal, Canada, to the Iranian air force, according to data from the firm Cirium. It counts 12 Bell 212 aircraft registered in Iran that are still in service.Bell Textron Inc. , based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it ""does not conduct any business in Iran or support their helicopter fleet, and we do not have knowledge about the active state of the helicopter involved in this accident.""But despite being decades old, the Bell 212 and its military counterpart the Huey still are flown around the world. In the United States, Hueys still fly as part of America's nuclear forces to support its silos and for some VIP missions, said Roger D. Connor, an aeronautics curator at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Over 440 still fly worldwide, according to Cirium.""It's a simple aircraft to fly by medium helicopter standards. It doesn't typically have much automation which can have both positive and negative implications for operators,"" Connor said. ""More automation means more opportunities for pilot confusion in certain circumstances, but also better capabilities in low-visibility conditions.""Iran's use of the Bell 212 remains pervasive, in part due to the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who struck deals to purchase hundreds of the helicopters and had plans to build a local variant, Nadimi said. Those already in the country at the time of the Islamic Revolution ended up being a key component of Iran's bloody war against Iraq in the 1980s.But as Western sanctions dried up the supply of parts, fewer of the aircraft were airworthy, despite efforts to locally overhaul them. That saw Iran engage in covert means to secure parts, sparking several U.S. criminal cases for those involved, who sought everything from safety equipment to full engines and night-vision goggles for the aircraft.Former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sought to blame sanctions for the crash. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded by saying America was ""not going to apologize for our sanctions regime at all"" as Iran has used aircraft to ""transport equipment to support terrorism.""""Ultimately, it's the Iranian government that is responsible for the decision to fly a ... helicopter in what was described as poor weather conditions, not any other actor,"" Miller said.Meanwhile, questions remain over why Iran couldn't find the helicopter for hours, even though one of the victims reportedly talked by cellphone with officials. Such calls, in theory, can be triangulated by security services. Also, it remains unclear if the helicopter had any emergency trackers, which are common on aircraft.While the investigation continues, Nadimi said he believed that the Bell 212 that flew Raisi did not have advanced avionics that could have been useful for low-visibility flight. However, he stressed that the major issue in the crash likely involves who allowed the flight to take off as the weather turned poor and whether the pilot faced pressure from his VIP passengers to make the journey no matter what.""Pilot error, human error might be to blame, but there was a chain of events that caused this crash, not just pilot error,"" Nadimi said. ""That helicopter should have been able to clear that terrain and fly safely to its destination. They should not have been dispatched for flying.""","Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash. They've rejected the possibility of an onboard ""explosion caused by sabotage"" or a ""cyberattack"" The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110813717,imgsize-52934,width-400,resizemode-4/110813717.jpg"

Pakistan's Punjab Assembly allows lawmakers to use of Punjabi language in house,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-punjab-assembly-allows-lawmakers-to-use-of-punjabi-language-in-house/articleshow/110783754.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in Pakistan 's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages , including Punjabi, in the house apart from English and Urdu after an amendment was made. A special committee of the Punjab Assembly, led by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan , approved on Thursday amendments allowing lawmakers to address the House in Punjabi, Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati in addition to English and Urdu, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.

Previously a member needed permission from the Speaker to use any language other than English and Urdu, which was not always granted.

The amendment in the assembly rules aimed to enhance accessibility for constituents who speak these languages, fostering a more representative and responsive legislative body, while the change reflects the multilingual nature of the province, enabling legislators to communicate and fully participate in legislative discussions effectively.

The Speaker stated that recognising and incorporating regional languages into official proceedings also demonstrates cultural respect and acknowledgement of the linguistic heritage of Punjab, thereby strengthening the connection between the Assembly and the people.

There is a controversy over whether Saraiki, Potohari, and Mewati are just dialects of Punjabi and separate languages. Those using them consider that these were separate languages but hardcore Punjabi brand them as dialects.","Lawmakers in Pakistan's Punjab Assembly would now be able to speak in at least four indigenous languages.

Putin issues dire warning to countries aiding Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-issues-dire-warning-to-countries-aiding-ukraine/articleshow/110775363.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning to countries assisting Ukraine, signaling severe consequences for those who continue to support Kyiv in its ongoing conflict with Moscow. In a public address on Friday, Putin cautioned, ""Anyone who tries to intervene in the Ukraine war will be met with 'lightning-fast' retaliation."" This statement underscores the escalating tensions in the region as international support for Ukraine remains strong.Speaking from the Kremlin , Putin emphasized Russia 's readiness to respond decisively to any foreign involvement. ""We have all the instruments for this, ones that no one can boast of now,"" he stated. ""We will use them if we have to. I want everyone to know that."" The Russian leader's remarks were broadcast during a meeting with lawmakers in St. Petersburg, reflecting his unwavering stance on the Ukraine conflict.Putin's comments come as Ukraine continues to receive significant military and economic aid from Western nations, particularly the United States and European Union countries. This support has been crucial for Ukraine's defense efforts against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2022. Despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, Russia's military actions have persisted, leading to widespread devastation and loss of life.The Russian president's address included a veiled reference to Russia's nuclear capabilities, although he did not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The warning aligns with previous threats made by Russian officials, who have suggested that any significant interference could escalate to a nuclear confrontation.In response to Putin's warning, NATO and allied countries have reiterated their commitment to supporting Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated, ""Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast. We will not be deterred by threats, and we continue to stand united in defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty.""The international community remains divided on how best to address the conflict. While Western nations continue to supply arms and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Russia has condemned these actions as provocations and escalations. Putin's recent rhetoric suggests that any further support for Ukraine could trigger a severe and unpredictable reaction from Russia.The conflict in Ukraine has drawn global attention, with numerous calls for peace negotiations and ceasefires. However, diplomatic efforts have so far failed to produce a lasting resolution. The war has caused a significant humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and creating widespread instability in the region.As the situation continues to evolve, the risk of further escalation looms large. Analysts warn that Putin's latest comments could signal a new phase in the conflict, with potentially far-reaching implications for global security.""We are at a critical juncture,"" said military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. ""The stakes are incredibly high, and any misstep could lead to a wider confrontation.""With tensions running high, the international community is watching closely for any signs of escalation or attempts at de-escalation.

Blinken returns to Mideast as Israel politics scramble push for truce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-returns-to-mideast-as-israel-politics-scramble-push-for-truce/articleshow/110858490.cms,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was heading back to the Middle East on Monday to push a ceasefire plan , but Israeli politics and silence from Hamas raised further questions on whether he can succeed.The top US diplomat, paying his eighth visit to the region since war broke out, was set to start the trip in Egypt and head later Monday to Israel Blinken is scheduled to hold closed-door talks first in Cairo with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a key US partner in peace efforts, and later in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Blinken planned the visit to push forward a proposal announced on May 31 by President Joe Biden, who has stepped up efforts to end a war that has taken a mounting toll on civilians and alienated parts of his base ahead of November elections.But Hamas, which opened the war with a massive October 7 attack on Israel that triggered a relentless retaliatory campaign, has not formally responded.And while Biden has described his plan as coming from Israel, the resignation on Sunday of a key centrist, Benny Gantz, from Netanyahu's war cabinet throws a new wild card on US diplomatic efforts.Gantz, a former general who leads in polls to replace Netanyahu if new elections are called, protested that the prime minister had not made the hard decisions to enable ""real victory"", including by thinking out a post-war plan for Gaza.Gantz has cast himself as a smoother partner for the United States than Netanyahu, a veteran of political squabbles with Israel's vital ally. Biden in recent weeks suspended a shipment of weapons to Israel and accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to stay in power, an assertion on which he backtracked.Gantz defied Netanyahu by visiting Washington on his own in March and has regularly met in Israel with Blinken, although a meeting on the latest trip was not immediately announced.- Border crossing dilemma -The short-term effect of Gantz leaving the war cabinet could be removing a counter-balance to Netanyahu's far-right allies, who abhor any compromise and have threatened to quit if Israel accepts the ceasefire plan.Israel also showed Saturday it has more tools than diplomacy to free hostages -- its key priority -- with an operation that freed four Israeli captives and which Palestinian officials say killed 274 other people.Overall Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,084 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, also mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Under the plan laid out by Biden, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centres and Hamas would free hostages. The ceasefire would last an initial six weeks, with the ceasefire extended as negotiators seek a permanent end to hostilities.Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, said Sunday it was difficult to say how the rescue operation would affect negotiations on a ceasefire.""If Hamas came and said yes to the deal on the table, there would be an end to the need for these kinds of operations, because the hostages would be coming out peacefully and not through military actions,"" Sullivan told ABC News.In Egypt, Blinken is also expected to speak to Sisi about solutions to open the key crossing into Gaza at Rafah.The month-long closure has worsened the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, sending prices of scarce goods skyrocketing and worsening fears voiced by the United Nations of famine in the blockaded territory.Israel seized the crossing from Hamas and has blamed Egypt for the closure.Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, has hit back and said that drivers feel unsafe going through what is now an Israeli checkpoint.Blinken was heading to the region from France, where he joined Biden on a state visit that marked the 80th anniversary of Allied troops' D-Day landing in German-occupied Normandy.Blinken will also visit two more key Arab partners, Jordan and Qatar, before returning Wednesday to join Biden at the Group of Seven summit in Italy.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading back to the Middle East to push a ceasefire plan.

Donald Trump floats tax-free tips in pitch to win Las Vegas workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-floats-tax-free-tips-in-pitch-to-win-las-vegas-workers/articleshow/110858451.cms,"Donald Trump said he’d scrap taxes on tipped earnings for hospitality workers if he wins the White House , calibrating his message for swing-state voters in Nevada as he fights back after his felony conviction.“We’re going to do that right away first thing in office because it’s been a point of contention for years and you do a great job of service — you take care of people,” the former president said at a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, his first since he was found guilty at his criminal trial in Manhattan.Trump’s latest tax-cut pledge signaled a bid to appeal to Nevada’s booming service industry dominated by young workers and people of color, two voter groups he’s courting as he heads toward the Republican National Convention in mid-July.The rally took Trump to a crucial state that President Joe Biden won in 2020, but where the president’s softening support among Black and Hispanic voters threatens to create an opening for Trump.“For those hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re going to be very happy,” he told the crowd. “Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on people making tips.”A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May found support for Trump and Biden tied at 47% in Nevada. Trump led Biden by 48% to 44% among voters across seven swing states, including Nevada, that are likely to determine the outcome of the election.The Culinary Union, which represents workers in the hospitality industry, derided Trump’s pledge. While relief is needed for tip earners, there’s a “difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement.The presumptive Republican nominee has stepped up campaigning after the New York trial largely kept him tied up in court, holding a town hall in battleground Arizona on Thursday and doing televised interviews. That follows a scaled-back campaign stretch with fewer rallies to preserve a war chest hit hard by legal fees.As a convicted felon running for president, Trump has thrust US politics into uncharted waters after a jury found him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. He still faces three other criminal trials, but those are unlikely to take place before the general election in November.","Donald Trump said he'd scrap taxes on tipped earnings for hospitality workers if he wins the White House.

US says Russia offensive against Kharkiv 'stalled',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-russia-offensive-against-kharkiv-stalled/articleshow/110857657.cms,"Representative Image/NYT

PARIS: US President Joe Biden's national security adviser said on Sunday that Russia's advance on Ukraine's Kharkiv ""has stalled"", after Washington partially lifted restrictions on using US-donated weapons to strike inside Russia.

""The momentum of that operation in Kharkiv has stalled out,"" Jake Sullivan told the CBS broadcaster.

""Kharkiv is still under threat but Russians have not been able to make material progress on the ground in recent days in that area.""

Washington has given the green light for Ukraine to use US weapons to defend its Kharkiv region, on the border with Russia, overcoming previous concerns that authorising such strikes could drag the Nato military alliance into a direct conflict with Russia.

""From the president's perspective, this was common sense,"" Sullivan said.

""It simply didn't make sense not to allow the Ukrainians to fire across that border, to hit Russian guns and emplacements that were firing at the Ukrainians.""

Biden, who is on a visit to France, met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris on Friday, reiterating his support for the war-torn country.

Speaking on Saturday, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""not stop"" at Ukraine.

""All of Europe will be threatened. We are not going to let that happen,"" Biden told journalists alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks at the Elysee Palace.

Russian forces made their most significant territorial gains in 18 months during a major ground assault on the Kharkiv region last month, capturing several Ukrainian border villages and forcing thousands from their homes.

NEW DELHI: Hours after the Hamas health ministry said that Israeli strikes killed over 210 at a refugee camp , thousands of Gaza war protestors held a rally near the White House on Saturday criticising US president Joe Biden's stance towards the war.

The White House, in response to questions about a possible invasion of the southern Gazan city, had said last monththat a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah did not cross a ""red line"" that Biden haddrawn two months earlier.

""I no longer believe any of the words that Joe Biden says,"" Zaid, a protestor whose parents are Palestinian, told AFP.

""This 'red line' in his rhetoric is rubbish... it shows his hypocrisy and his cowardice,"" Zaid added.

' Bombing children is not self-defense'

Holding Palestinian flags and chanting ""From DC to Palestine, we are the red line,"" the protestors demonstrated placards and banners with names of Palestinians killed during Israeli offensive during the last nine months.

The protestors expressed distrust with the Biden administration and their response to the Israel-Hamas war.

""Biden's red line was a lie"", said a poster while, ""Bombing children is not self-defense,"" read another.

Prior to the protest, which saw charter buses bring in attendees from as far afield as Maine and Florida, the White House increased security with the installation of an additional anti-scale perimeter fence.

Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion.But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defence, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Elysees leading to the Elysee Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements. Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.""Proud to be here,"" Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. ""A great honour.""Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the Covid-19 pandemic receded.Jill Biden flew back to Paris aboard a US government plane after spending Friday in Delaware to support their son, Hunter Biden, who is standing trial on federal gun charges.As the president's trip draws to a close, the far right is likely to emerge as one of the biggest winners in Sunday's European Parliament election while Macron's pro-European Union movement is flagging.A top French official said Macron and Biden have a friendly and warm relationship and stressed that the US president is spending five days in France, reflecting the importance he attaches to the visit. The official spoke anonymously, in line with customary practices for Macron's office.The official said the US presidential campaign was not a factor in the discussion.Macron hosted then-President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee this year, for Bastille Day in 2017, and he came to Washington for a state visit in 2018 before their relationship soured.US and French officials said Ukraine would be at the top of Saturday's agenda, but the centrepiece of the weekend event would be the strength of the alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago, but with roots far deeper.""It's probably a good thing for us to remember that we didn't win our independence either without some foreign help or foreign assistance, specifically from France,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday.Max Bergmann, a former US State Department official who leads Europe research at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the US-French relationship is strong despite occasional disagreements.""There's always tension in Franco-American relations because the French try to do stuff,"" he said. ""They're bold, they throw up proposals, and that leads to some friction when we push back.""For example, he said, France proposed putting Western trainers on the ground in Ukraine, leading to questions of whether this is ""really giving Ukraine a major, tangible benefit"" or has the ""potential to be escalatory and dangerous.""Regarding Macron, Bergmann said, ""he's the one that pushes the boundaries and throws up ideas.""Kirby said the two leaders would have an announcement Saturday on deepening maritime law enforcement cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. They also were to discuss economic and climate challenges.While praising the Biden administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine, Macron said earlier this year that Europe must become ""capable of defending its interests, with its allies by our side whenever they are willing, and alone if necessary,"" arguing the continent should rely less on the US for its own defence.He also warned Western powers against showing any signs of weakness to Russia as he repeatedly said that sending Western troops into Ukraine to shore up its defence should not be ruled out.The leaders were also set to discuss their efforts to bring about a cease-fire to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, as the US and Israel await Hamas' response to a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory.Macron is expected to raise US trade practices that he has often criticised, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favours American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the US, like China, has ""decided not to respect the rules of global trade"" by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe's industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation.The French official said Europe has to defend European interests, after watching the US do the same with its own, but said Macron hopes to find a mutually acceptable outcome.Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said trade with China is a sticking point between the US and Europe, particularly France. The US has been more eager to restrict trade, particularly regarding technology.Biden is also moving toward tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries, which could affect European cars that include Chinese parts.Overall, Hufbauer said, ""Europe wants to maintain much more trade with China than the US wants.""",President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit.

We will not, I say it again, walk away,"" he added.Biden, 81, is set to face his Republican rival and predecessor Trump later this year in presidential elections that commentators predict will subject US democracy to a severe test.Trump has also signalled his lack of interest in international organisations including Nato and previously boasted he could solve the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours if elected.Macron, 46, emphasised the unity with the United States under Biden and expressed gratitude for his counterpart's approach to Europe.""I thank you, Mr President, for being the president of the world's number one power but doing it with the loyalty of a partner who likes and respects the Europeans,"" he said.He said Paris and Washington also shared the same views on Iran, accusing Tehran of pursuing a ""strategy of escalation at all levels"".""Our two countries are determined to exert the necessary pressure to stop this trend,"" he said.Biden has been in France since Wednesday and took part in this week's commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in northern France involving US, British, Canadian and other foreign troops that changed the course of World War II.Also invited to the ceremonies was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who told Biden in a bilateral meeting Friday that Kyiv was counting on ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" support.Expressing regret over how an aid package for Ukraine was held up in the US legislature, Biden said: ""I wish we could have done it when we wanted to six months earlier but we got it done.""The United States and France are two of Kyiv's main Western backers since Russia unleashed its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.The US leader met Macron for talks at the Elysee Palace, with the two men seen talking one-to-one at a table in the Elysee gardens under a sunshade on a warm Paris June afternoon.""France was our first friend,"" Biden said, referring to French support in the War of Independence against British colonial rule. ""And remains one of our best ones,"" he added.During a welcome ceremony in Paris, Macron and Biden laid a wreath and rekindled the flame on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe.They then drove down the Champs-Elysees, decked out in the colours of the two nations, flanked by 140 horses and 38 motorcyclists.The US president and his wife Jill were later to return to the Elysee Palace for a state banquet given in Biden's honour.The week of high-profile events has provided both Biden and Macron an opportunity to burnish their image with voters.Macron's camp has faced an uphill struggle to narrow a gap with the far right ahead of European Parliament elections on Sunday.After his own talks with Zelenskyy in Paris on Friday evening, Macron said he wanted to ""finalise"" the creation of a coalition of military instructors to train Ukrainian troops in the coming days.Macron also lashed out at what he called a ""camp of pacifists"" and the ""spirit of defeat"" over Ukraine's fight against Russia, vowing Ukrainian resistance would not end with capitulation.","US President Joe Biden on Saturday vowed Washington was ""standing strong"" with Ukraine.

Two members of Ahmadi community shot dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-members-of-ahmadi-community-shot-dead/articleshow/110826007.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Two members of the minority Ahmadi community were shot dead in Pakistan ’s central Punjab province on Saturday, days after a vicious campaign was launched against the Supreme Court order releasing a person from the persecuted sect in a 2022 case.

The incident occurred in Sadullapur area of Mandi Bahauddin district.

The victims, a 50-year-old man and another 25 years old, were targeted by an unknown assailant when they were en route to a nearby market.

District police officer Ahmad Mohiuddin said the suspected attacker has been arrested from the same locality and the murder weapon seized. “He was involved in both shootings,” he claimed.

Following the incident, a large police force was deployed in the area.

Police said they first took both bodies into custody and moved them to a local government-run hospital for post-mortem analyses, after which the bodies would be handed over to the victims’ relatives.

There are an estimated four million Ahmadis in Pakistan, a country of over 220 million people. They live in fear in a Muslim majority country due to intimidation and threats of death. A sustained hate campaign has been on against them for decades. The community’s members avoid revealing or speaking about their faith in public.

Over the last few decades, Pakistan’s minority communities have borne the brunt of mob brutality, bomb attacks, arsons, lynchings and other forms of violence. Last month, a district president of the Ahmadi community was killed by unknown assailants.
