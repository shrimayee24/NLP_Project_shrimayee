NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Monday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of resorting to the constant ""India-shaming & India-bashing"" statements, saying ""we are worried"" about his remarks abroad.Rijiju said he didn't want to comment on the Congress scion's personal visits, but his remarks abroad ""against India's interest"" as the Lok Sabha leader of opposition are ""worrying"".""Tell me one Leader of Opposition who spoke against India's interest in a foreign country. I don't want to comment about Rahul Gandhi Ji's regular personal trip abroad. But as leader of opposition, we are worried due to his constant India-shaming & India-bashing!"" he told news agency ANI.The remarks come after Rahul, while speaking at an event at EIA University in Colombia on Thursday, said, “India has strong capabilities in areas like engineering and healthcare, so I am very optimistic about the country. But at the same time, there are also flaws in the structure that India has to correct. The biggest challenge is the attack on democracy taking place in India.”Speaking on the Gen-Z (Generation-Z: born between 1997-2012), which has come to the spotlight after violent protests in the neighbouring Nepal that overthrew the Oil-led communist government, Rijiju said: ""India's Gen-Z are sensible, sincere, sharp, smart and steadfast in their mission to make India a great nation.""Rijiju, in a piercing attack at the Congress party, said ""the Gen Zs would not tolerate the party and the family who kept India poor for 6 decades"".""They will reject corrupt and inefficient politicians who only care for one family!"" he said.After his presser claiming deletion of voters from Karnataka's Aland constituency last month, Rahul Gandhi had written in a post on X, ""The youth of the nation The students of the nation The Gen Z of the nation Will protect the Constitution, defend democracy, and prevent vote theft. I will always stand with them. Hail India!""His shoutout to Gen Z to “stop vote theft” sparked a sharp retort from the BJP , with Nishikant Dubey quipping: “They are against corruption, why wouldn’t they drive you out?”Dubey claimed that Gen Z wants ""an Islamic state in Bangladesh and a Hindu state in Nepal, why wouldn’t they make India a Hindu state?""""Gen Z is against family rule. Why would they tolerate Rahul Ji after Nehru Ji, Indira Ji, Rajiv Ji, Sonia Ji? They are against corruption, why wouldn’t they drive you out?

NEW DELHI: Odisha 's Cuttack witnessed fresh communal tensions and violent clashes on Sunday after police denied permission for a bike rally organised by a group.The confrontation escalated, leading to stone pelting, arson, and a police crackdown that left at least 25 people, including eight police personnel, injured. Authorities have imposed a 36-hour curfew and suspended internet services to prevent further unrest as rioters set fire to eight to ten locations on Sunday.As the atmosphere in Cuttack remains highly tense, demonstrators occupied major streets on Sunday, culminating in a call for a Cuttack Bandh on Monday. During the rally, protesters were heard raising provocative slogans demanding an “exclusive Hindu-only identity” for the city.Chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi expressed sorrow over the group clash and urged all citizens to maintain peace and order.""Cuttack, with its rich thousand-year history, stands as a testament to unity and brotherhood. However, in recent days, the peace in the city was disrupted by some miscreants, affecting the daily lives of ordinary people. The govt is keeping an eye on these miscreants and will take strict action against them,"" the CM's statement read.The violent confrontation in Cuttack stemmed from a series of incidents that began during the Durga idol immersion procession late Friday night and escalated further on Sunday.Tension first broke out around 2 am on the intervening night of Friday-Saturday when the Jhanjirimangala Bhagabat Puja Committee’s procession was heading to Debigada for the immersion of Goddess Durga.Local residents reportedly objected to the loud music accompanying the procession, sparking a heated argument between the two groups. The situation quickly spiralled out of control as stones and glass bottles were hurled near Dargah Bazar Jail Road, turning the area into a conflict zone.Police were forced to resort to a lathi-charge to disperse the mob. Several people were injured in the melee, including Deputy Commissioner of Police Rishikesh Khilari, who sustained a forehead injury after being hit by a stone.After this incident, police heightened security across the city amid fears of communal tension. On Sunday, an organisation sought permission to conduct a bike rally, but authorities denied it, citing the fragile situation after the earlier clash. Despite the denial, some members of the group attempted to go ahead with the rally, resulting in a fresh confrontation with the police.As the rally participants clashed with security forces, stone pelting resumed, injuring several police personnel. The unrest spread to nearby areas, with reports of fires being set at multiple locations. Authorities eventually used force to disperse the mob, imposed a 36-hour curfew, and suspended internet services to restore order in the city.""Today, an organisation in Cuttack requested permission to hold a bike rally, but it was denied. This led to a clash with the police. When the police enforced that they would not be allowed to pass through the road, as it could lead to communal tensions. Eight policemen were injured in the stone pelting. These individuals were later dispersed using force,"" Police Commissioner Suresh Debadutta Singh told news agency ANI.After the clashes, authorities imposed a 36-hour curfew in affected areas and suspended internet services for 24 hours.Cuttack District Magistrate Dattatraya Bhausaheb Shinde confirmed the measures, said: ""Right now, the situation is under control. Unfortunately, some issues arose during the evening. Unfortunately, the crowd went out of control, and there were some injuries on the police side, so we have immediately stopped internet services for 24 hours in the city. The curfew will be imposed immediately. Additional forces have been requisitioned, and we already have around ten companies in place. But we will also be getting around three platoons of force from the Central Armed Forces.""He appealed for peace, emphasising the city’s communal harmony.""We request everybody, and we appeal to everybody that Cuttack has always been the city of brotherhood, and let us continue that way. We have also been engaging with the community leaders of various communities over the last two to three days. We have been engaging with them, and we are continuing this engagement, and they have all assured us that this will not happen again,"" Shinde said.He assured that within the next 24 hours the situation will be under control.""DGP has already ensured that whoever has tried to breach this peace in this peaceful city will not be spared. The internet has been banned for 24 hours, and we think that within 24 hours, we will be able to bring that under control. If not, we are ready to ban it for the next 24 hours also,"" the Cuttack DM said.Police officials dismissed rumours circulating on social media about a death linked to a prior incident during Durga idol immersion.""We have also learned that rumours were being spread that one of the four individuals who were injured in the stone-pelting incident during Durga idol immersion has died. Those who spread these rumours will be arrested. Of the four injured that day, all had minor injuries. Three were discharged the same day. One is being treated. A curfew will be imposed to maintain peace,"" Commissioner Singh clarified to news agency ANI.The state government suspended internet and social media services in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the 42 Mauza Region until 7 PM on Monday.According to a government circular, a prohibition has been imposed ""on the use and access of social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and X, until 7 PM on Monday in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the 42 Mauza Region.”The order was issued under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Rule 2(1) of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency/Public Safety) Rules, 2017.Even as security forces conducted flag marches to maintain order, rioters set fire to multiple locations in the Gouri Shankar Park area.Assistant Fire Officer Sanjeeb Kumar Behera said: ""We received information that near the Gouri Shankar Park, rioters have set fire to 8-10 places. We have extinguished the fire. The rioters are pelting stones at us. Police have been deployed to control the situation.""According to reports, stone pelting continued in parts of the city as police reinforcements were deployed.Odisha Director-General of Police Yogesh Bahadur Khurania assured that the situation was under control.""The police are closely monitoring the situation. Action will be taken against all anti-social elements involved in the violence. I would like to inform all residents of Cuttack not to trust any rumour. They should immediately check the police website, the Commissionerate's website, and their Twitter handle.""Former Odisha chief minister and leader of opposition Naveen Patnaik appealed for calm and harmony, expressing deep concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the city.Local leaders have condemned the incident. MLA Sofia Firdous and former MLA Md. Moquim described the situation as ""very unfortunate"" and urged citizens to work towards restoring peace. Both leaders emphasised the importance of maintaining Cuttack's long-standing tradition of unity and cooperation among communities.""We must remain patient and committed to making everything normal again. The city has always been a symbol of unity, and it is crucial that we all work together to ensure this doesn't divide us,"" said MLA Sofia Firdous.Echoing similar sentiments, former MLA Md. Moquim emphasised that the authorities would ensure the accused would face strict punishment. ""Justice will be served, and the rule of law will prevail,"" he assured.","Cuttack witnessed fresh communal tensions and violent clashes on Sunday after police denied permission for a bike rally organised by a group.

LUCKNOW/BAHRAICH: Uttar Pradesh's forest department issued Sunday ""shoot on sight"" orders for wolves following a spate of attacks in Bahraich district that have left six people, including four children, dead in the past two months. The order coincided with fresh attacks that left three villagers injured.""Given the repeated attacks by wolves on villagers, state government has authorised our teams to take strict action to neutralise any aggressive wolves posing a direct threat to human life,"" district forest officer (DFO) Ram Singh Yadav said.Officials emphasised that the measure was intended as a last-resort safety step, targeting only wolves that exhibit violent behaviour towards humans, while regular wildlife in the forest remains protected under state laws. Authorities said Bahraich's Kaiserganj and Mahsi areas were the worst affected.The latest attacks on Sunday left two villagers in Tediya Kotia in Ramganj area and one in Bahorwa Naubasta seriously wounded. Following this, enraged villagers reportedly cornered and killed the animal. DFO Yadav directed a team to visit the spot. ""We examined the animal and found it to be a jackal. The attacks were carried out by the jackal,"" he said.According to reports, Sushila (21) was attacked when she stepped out of home for routine chores. The animal, hiding in the bushes, leapt on her. Hearing her screams, villagers rushed to the scene. During the commotion, it entered the house of Ram Kumar (40) and attacked him. Both were rushed to hospital, where their condition was said to be stable.In Bahorwa Naubasta village, Barsati Lal Shukla, 62, was attacked by a wolf on his farm. He suffered leg injuries but fended off the animal by charging at it with a sickle.State minister Arun Kumar, meanwhile, conducted a survey of Kaiserganj along with DM Akshay Tripathi and other senior officials. He met the families of some of the villagers who died or were injured in wolf attacks and pledged aid. Officials briefed him on efforts to contain the menace. tnn","Six people, including four children, have been killed by wolves in the past two months.

Bengal floods: Trajectory change of low-pressure system led to havoc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-floods-trajectory-change-of-low-pressure-system-led-to-havoc/articleshow/124328070.cms,"A portion of a road connecting Siliguri and Darjeeling, damaged after landslide on Sunday

KOLKATA: Devastating rain that flooded the plains and hills of north Bengal was brought by an unexpected change in the trajectory of a low-pressure system triggered by the retreating monsoon, meteorologists have said.The system, which formed over the Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, made landfall in Odisha as a depression and was moving north-northwest towards Chhattisgarh when it suddenly recurved towards north Bihar, coming dangerously close to north Bengal.“Even though not very intense, such systems cover a wide region. North Bengal fell within the periphery of this one, which explains the heavy rain. In fact, Kolkata, too, continues to be impacted by the same system,” a meteorologist said.Sourish Bandopadhyay, a scientist at the regional meteorological centre, said, “Clouds kept floating into the hills and over Dooars. Extremely heavy rain, over 200mm in around 24 hours, occurred in some parts of Darjeeling, Alipurduar, Kalimpong, and Jalpaiguri on Friday and Saturday. Its intensity reduced Sunday.”Darjeeling recorded 261mm of rain in 24 hours till 8 am on Sunday, followed by Cooch Behar (192mm), Jalpaiguri (172mm), and Bagdogra-Siliguri (134mm).Excess water flowing through rivers entering Bengal from Sikkim and Bhutan only worsened the devastation.“Since monsoon is now retreating from north India, strong westerly winds diverted the system towards north Bihar, bringing it closer to north Bengal. It was prevented from advancing into central India, which is the usual path for such systems... The ‘recurve’ was unexpected but not unusual,” said a meteorologist. In its current state as a cyclonic circulation, the system still covers a wide area — across north Bihar, hills of Bengal, and eastern Nepal.“Rain will continue in these areas. The system is likely to move towards Bangladesh, though it may lose steam over the next 48 hours,” the meteorologist added.","The system, which formed over the Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, made landfall in Odisha as a depression.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

SRINAGAR/JAIPUR: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the September 24 firing in Leh, which left four people dead and over 70 wounded, and said he was prepared to remain in prison until the probe is conducted.In his first message from Jodhpur central jail, Wangchuk appealed to the people of Ladakh to maintain peace and unity while continuing their fight for statehood and Sixth Schedule status “in the true Gandhian way of non-violence”.“I stand firmly with Apex Body Leh, Kargil Democratic Alliance, and the people of Ladakh in our genuine constitutional demand for Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Wangchuk said in the message relayed by Mustafa Haji, legal advisor to the apex body. “Whatever actions Apex Body Leh takes in the interest of Ladakh, I am with them wholeheartedly.”Haji and Wangchuk’s elder brother Ka Tsetan Dorjey Ley met him at Jodhpur jail Saturday. Haji posted Sunday the activist’s message on X and Facebook, quoting Wangchuk as saying he was “doing well, both physically and mentally” and thanking supporters for their concern and prayers. He expressed condolences to the families of those killed and said his “prayers are with those wounded and arrested”.Wangchuk was taken into custody on September 26 under NSA, two days after protests in Leh turned violent. Police and paramilitary forces fired at demonstrators demanding Ladakh’s inclusion under Sixth Schedule and restoration of statehood. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Monday a petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali J Angmo challenging his arrest under NSA and seeking his immediate release.The unrest came amid Wangchuk’s hunger strike, launched on Sept 10 to press for those demands. The clashes and fatal firing on Sept 24 prompted Wangchuk to call off his fast.Union home ministry had earlier announced that the next round of talks with Ladakh representatives would be held on October 6, but both ABL and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) withdrew after the killings, insisting that dialogue could resume only after a judicial probe into the firing and the release of those arrested, including Wangchuk.While the UT administration in Ladakh has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the Leh violence, ABL and KDA have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge before returning to talks.",Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the September 24 firing in Leh.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Key details have emerged following the investigation of Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, who was arrested for his role in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Officials said on Sunday that Katari met the three terrorists behind the attack—Sulieman alias Asif, Jibran, and Hamza Afghani, four times and provided them logistical support, including an Android phone charger, which became a key piece of evidence leading to his capture, reported PTI.Katari, a resident of South Kashmir’s Kulgam district, reportedly told investigators that he had met the attackers in the Zabarwan hills outside Srinagar. He had also guided them through the difficult terrain.His arrest followed weeks of investigation, including forensic analysis of items recovered during Operation Mahadev in July, which killed the three terrorists linked to the Pahalgam massacre. Security agencies tracked the partially destroyed phone charger to Katari, confirming his connection to the attackers.Authorities indicated that Katari’s interrogation may uncover further links in the terror support network in the Kashmir Valley. The case could be transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is already probing the broader conspiracy behind the Pahalgam attack.The NIA has arrested two individuals so far in connection with the April 22 terror attack for allegedly offering logistical support and shelter to the terrorists.The April 22 attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot often called “mini Switzerland,” marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since the 2019 Pulwama attack. TRF, a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), had claimed responsibility.","Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, was arrested for his role in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.

NEW DELHI: Cuttack remained tense on Sunday following new incidents of violence linked to a group clash during a Durga idol immersion procession two days ago.Due to the tense law and order situation, the state government suspended internet services from 7 pm on Sunday to 7 pm on Monday in areas under Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the nearby 42 Mauza region to curb the spread of misinformation.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had organised a motorcycle rally on Sunday evening despite orders from the district administration. Officials said CCTV cameras along the route were damaged and shops in the Gourishankar Park area were set on fire after police tried to stop the procession.According to PTI, the rally began at Bidyadharpur on the city’s eastern outskirts and moved through key areas, including the Dargah Bazar locality where the previous violence occurred, before ending at Sector 11 of CDA. Participants were heard chanting “Jai Shri Ram” as they moved through the city.Odisha's CM Mohan Charan Majhi, in a statement issued by the chief minister’s office, expressed sorrow over the disturbances. “Cuttack is a thousand-year-old city known for its brotherhood. Due to the actions of some miscreants, the peace of the city has been disturbed in recent days,” he said. He added that the government was monitoring troublemakers closely and strict action would be taken against them as per the law.BJD chief Naveen Patnaik also expressed concern over the situation, saying Odisha has a reputation as a peace-loving state.Meanwhile, the VHP has announced a 12-hour bandh in Cuttack on Monday to protest the clash during the Durga immersion procession.The original clashes broke out around 1.30 am to 2 am on Saturday near Haathi Pokhari in Dargah Bazar as the immersion procession moved towards Debigara on the Kathajodi river banks. Officials said the violence started after locals objected to high-decibel music. The confrontation escalated when a mob began pelting stones and glass bottles from rooftops, injuring several revellers, including Cuttack DCP Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo.

"Manipur ambush: Intel hints at ‘contract killing’ to undermine President’s rule; PLA denies role, 15 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-ambush-intel-hints-at-contract-killing-to-undermine-presidents-rule-pla-denies-role-15-arrested/articleshow/124321150.cms,"Assam Rifles vehicle after an ambush in Nambol Sabal area last month

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies suspect that last month’s attack on an Assam Rifles convoy in Nambol, Manipur, may have been a politically motivated “contract killing.” Officials, quoted by PTI, say it could have been aimed at destabilising the state’s fragile situation, undermining President’s rule.Officials alleged that certain vested interests could be seeking to weaken President’s rule, which has helped curb severe ethnic violence in the state. According to them, these groups are promoting the view that the present administration is ineffective and pushing for the immediate reinstatement of the suspended state assembly.The attack, which killed two Assam Rifles personnel on September 19, was unusual as the PLA, a banned valley-based insurgent group, did not claim responsibility—breaking its 48-year tradition of owning operations. PTI Sources indicate the PLA leadership may have been unaware of or had not sanctioned the assault.In a major crackdown following the attack, security forces arrested 15 PLA members, including key suspects Thoungram Sadananda Singh alias Purakpa (18) and Khomdram Ojit Singh alias Keilal (47), within 72 hours of the incident. Authorities recovered six weapons likely stolen from a police armoury during earlier ethnic clashes and a van believed to have been used in the ambush.The Nambol attack, carried out in Sabal Leikai where the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is not in force, marked the first assault on central forces since the outbreak of ethnic clashes between Meiteis and Kuki-Zos in May 2023. Naib Subedar Shyam Gurung and Rifleman Ranjit Singh Kashyap were killed when their vehicle was attacked en route from Patsoi to the Nambol base.Officials are also probing potential political support for the PLA, particularly following the UNLF’s recent announcement to cease hostilities and join the Union Home Ministry’s Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement. Analysts warn that disaffected members of PLA, UNLF, KYKL, and PREPAK could exploit the ceasefire to target civilians.Thoungram Sadananda Singh had previously been with the UNLF before transferring to the PLA. The PLA, originally known as ‘Polei’, seeks Manipur’s independence and a separate Meitei homeland in the Imphal Valley. Other insurgent groups, including KYKL, PREPAK, and KCP, maintain significant presence in the valley and along the India-Myanmar border.Manipur has witnessed sustained ethnic tensions since May 2023, resulting in over 260 deaths and nearly 50,000 displaced, driven by disputes over land rights and political representation.","Intelligence agencies suspect that last month’s attack on an Assam Rifles convoy in Nambol, Manipur, may have been a politically motivated “contract killing” Officials say it could have been aimed at destabilising the state’S fragile situation.

'Failure Of Personalised Diplomacy’: Congress Hits Out At PM Modi Over Russia-Pakistan Arms Deal

NEW DELHI: A political spat broke out over the weekend after Congress , citing a media report, accused Modi government of allowing ally Russia to proceed with supply of advanced RD-93MA engines to Pakistan for its Chinese-made JF-17 fighter jets.

NEW DELHI: The West Bengal BJP on Sunday criticised chief minister Mamata Banerjee for attending the state-organised Durga Puja carnival in Kolkata while at least 20 people were reported dead in landslide-hit Darjeeling following relentless rainfall.BJP leaders accused Banerjee of being indifferent to the crisis unfolding in north Bengal, alleging that her participation in the carnival sent the wrong message at a time when parts of the state were grappling with a natural disaster.""What she has done shows the step-motherly attitude of her government towards north Bengal. It is akin to the burning of Rome while Emperor Nero was fiddling with violin,"" said BJP state president and Rajya Sabha MP Samik Bhattacharya, as quoted by PTI.Leader of opposition in state assembly Suvendu Adhikari also hit out at the CM, accusing her of prioritising festivities over governance. “The CM is only obsessed with ‘utsav and mela’ (festivals and fairs), turning a deaf ear to the sufferings of people,” he told reporters, demanding immediate deployment of NDRF and paramilitary forces across affected areas.At least 20 people, including children, were killed in landslides triggered by continuous downpours across Mirik and nearby areas.Villages have been cut off, homes swept away, and hundreds of tourists left stranded. Fatalities were reported from multiple locations including Sarsaly, Jasbirgaon, Mirik Basti, Dhar Gaon, Nagrakata, and near Mirik Lake, according to NDRF and district administration data.BJP MLA and chief whip Shankar Ghosh said, ""The CM is busy with the carnival, while north Bengal is reeling under excessive rain and landslides.""In response, Trinamool Congress defended the chief minister’s schedule, stating that the carnival had been announced in advance and attended by dignitaries, including international guests. “The chief minister has been continuously monitoring the situation since midnight, and taking every possible step. Once the carnival gets over, she will visit the affected areas on Monday,” TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said.Banerjee has described the situation in the hills as “grave” and announced compensation for the victims, though the amount has not yet been specified.

NEW DELHI: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said it doesn’t “befit” the Lok Sabha’s leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi , to speak of Gen Z, saying that it was the young generation which ousted the Congress from power.Rijiju added that the youth support Prime Minister Narendra Modi .""It doesn't befit Rahul Gandhi to speak of Gen Z. The young generation has ousted them (Congress) from power. Gen Z means the new mindset of a new generation – it stands with PM Modi. India's Gen Z is against the control of this country in the hands of one party, one family. It is against corruption... Gen Z's anger is directed towards those who are not capable but want to run the Government, against the family that has captured the party. Our government is dedicated to people. Gen Z is against the Congress,"" the parliamentary affairs minister told ANI.The phrase “Gen Z” entered India’s political lexicon after youth-led protests led to a change of government in neighbouring Nepal.On September 18, just after his second round of presentation on alleged poll fraud, Gandhi had called on India’s Gen Z to “protect the Constitution” and pledged his support to them in stopping “vote chori (vote theft).”Responding to this, Rijiju said, ""Now, when they can't win elections, they abuse the Election Commission, put allegations of 'vote chori'. Youth are connected with Modi ji, the country stands with Modi ji.""In his first press conference in August, Gandhi had alleged electoral malpractice in the Mahadevapura assembly segment in Bengaluru, in Congress-ruled Karnataka. In the second, he focused on the Aland assembly seat, also in Karnataka.The Election Commission, which Gandhi has accused of indulging in ""vote chori"" to benefit the ruling BJP, has dismissed his allegations.Meanwhile, Gandhi has been teasing a “hydrogen bomb” after his “atom bomb” claims in the first press conference.","Kiren Rijiju: It doesn't befit Rahul Gandhi to speak of Gen Z.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his recent remarks made during a visit to Colombia, claiming that he is the first leader of opposition (LoP) to speak against India on foreign soil.In an interview to ANI, the parliamentary affairs minister said, “Even Indira Gandhi ji was LoP after losing elections, but she never spoke about the country outside. All other LoPs after her - whether it is Lal Krishna Advani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sushma Swaraj, Sharad Pawar - never did that.”“Show me one LoP who has ever gone outside India and made statements against the country or the Government. Rahul Gandhi is the first LoP who goes abroad and speaks against the country, our system and our democracy,” Rijiju added.The remarks come after Rahul, while speaking at an event at EIA University in Colombia on Thursday, said, “India has strong capabilities in areas like engineering and healthcare, so I am very optimistic about the country. But at the same time, there are also flaws in the structure that India has to correct. The biggest challenge is the attack on democracy taking place in India.”Rijiju alleged that Rahul's comments misrepresent India and could harm its global image.“Our LoP went abroad and said that India cannot be a global leader. The problem is that if people abroad get the impression that everyone in India is like Rahul Gandhi, it would tarnish the country's reputation,” he said.“There are intelligent people in our country, we have good leaders and people with good ideology. But if Rahul Gandhi speaks like this, people would think that such people are higher in number in India. This is not right,” Rijiju added.The Union minister also rejected Congress’s allegations of curbs on free speech, saying that the party was misusing the idea of freedom of expression for political purposes. “From morning to evening, they keep on abusing PM Modi and say there is no freedom to speak. They want to misuse this freedom of expression to such an extent that they want to split the nation,” he said.Rijiju further claimed that some leaders advocating for free speech are those who, according to him, have supported divisive causes. “Those who talk about freedom of speech are the people who want to separate Jammu and Kashmir and the North East from the nation,” he said.He emphasised that the BJP’s response to Rahul’s remarks is not personal. “We have nothing to do with him personally. He is LoP... If he speaks irresponsibly, we will not like it,” Rijiju said.","Kiren Rijiju claims that Rahul Gandhi is the first leader of opposition to speak against India on foreign soil.

Kyren Lacy’s attorney Matthew Ory challenges crash claims

Kyren Lacy’s death in Houston and reactions from family and teammates

“They slander your name, your character, and painted you as the bad guy. But we your family, teammates, and friends know the real you LLK2.”

“Young parents, start talking to your kids … Mental health is real, and for the most part it’s invisible. Don’t ignore the signs, even if they may seem small,”

Kyren Lacy, 24-year-old former LSU wide receiver, is back in the headlines after his attorney shared new evidence about his case. On October 3, 2025, attorney Matthew Ory spoke to HTV10 and said video footage shows that Lacy was far behind the cars involved in a fatal crash in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, on December 17, 2024. That accident killed Herman Hall, 78, and injured two people. Authorities had accused Lacy of causing the crash. Ory now says those claims were wrong.Matthew Ory showed a video from a nearby gas station that he says changes the story. The clip shows Lacy’s car was about 72.6 yards behind the vehicles that collided with Hall’s car. Ory admitted that Lacy did pass four cars earlier, but said he was already back in his lane at the time of the crash.Ory told HTV10, “He was back in his lane … 72.6 yards behind the vehicles at the time of impact. That is not how this story was ever painted, never.”Louisiana State Police have a different view. They still say Lacy’s passing maneuvers forced another driver to swerve, leading to the deadly accident. A police statement said, “His swerving, passing cars, and reckless operation caused the series of crash events.”After the crash, Kyren Lacy was charged with negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run, and reckless operation of a vehicle.He turned himself in on January 12, 2025, and was released after posting $151,000 bail.Months later, in April 2025, Lacy’s life ended in Houston, Texas. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office said he refused to stop for police, leading to a chase that lasted several miles. After his car crashed, deputies found that Lacy had shot himself. His death came just one day before he was scheduled to appear before a grand jury in Houston.Former LSU teammate Sai’Vion Jones, now with the Denver Broncos, wrote on X,Also Read: “I Don’t Consider Him”: Stephen A.

A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning, leaving her ex-senator husband, Arnold Goodstein, and two other family members hospitalized.Goodstein's four-bedroom, four-bath $1,155,200 home, stretching up a three-story property on Edisto Beach, was engulfed in flames around 11.30 am as stunned neighbors looked on. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause, while dramatic drone footage captured the inferno consuming the residence.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is investigating the fire, a spokesperson confirmed. Although Goodstein was not present at the time, multiple family members, including her ex-senator husband Arnold Goodstein, were at home. South Carolina Chief Justice John Kittredge stated that the fire resulted from an ""apparent explosion,"" Daily Mail reported""Judge Goodstein was walking on the beach when the fire started. Her husband, Arnie, was in the house with children and perhaps grandchildren. The family had to escape by jumping from a window or balcony. I’m told there were injuries from the fall, such as broken legs,"" Kittredge said.Of the three family members hospitalised, Arnold Goodstein is reported to have leaped from the burning building after assisting other family members to escape.""Arnie’s injuries may have been the most serious, for he was airlifted to the hospital,"" Kittredge added.He sustained multiple broken bones in his hips, legs and feet, according to reports. Another hospitalised individual is reported to be Goodstein's son, Arnold Goodstein II.Their current condition remains unclear.Kittredge mentioned that SLED chief Mark Keel stated he would stay in touch and inform if there is any evidence of arson. ""At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Chief Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security,"" he added.Goodstein had reportedly been receiving death threats in recent weeks. ""She's had multiple death threats over the years,"" a judge close to Goodstein told the outlet. In early September, she was involved in a controversial case regarding whether voters' personal information in South Carolina could be handed over to the government.Goodstein issued a temporary restraining order in early September, stemming from a lawsuit challenging the South Carolina Election Commission's ability to provide voters’ data to the Department of Justice, The Gazette reported.However, the order was later overturned after a six-page opinion from the Supreme Court criticised Goodstein's process in barring the state from complying. The Supreme Court, signed by all five justices, criticised Goodstein for not detailing the damage that would occur from the release of voters' personal information, specifically that of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the suit to prevent her information from being disclosed to the federal govt.","A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning.

Trump 'Drops In' At Defence Meet, Stuns Pete Hegseth, Top Generals; Power Move On Camera





US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday dismissed Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, a powerful aide who had overseen a major reshaping of the service’s bureaucracy. The abrupt removal came shortly after the Senate confirmed Navy Undersecretary Hung Cao earlier this week.“He will no longer serve as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Navy,” the Pentagon said in a statement, confirming Harrison’s departure. “We are grateful for his service to the Department.”Harrison, working closely with Navy Secretary John Phelan, spearheaded sweeping changes to the service’s policy and budgeting offices while seeking to curb the undersecretary’s influence.Traditionally, the Navy secretary’s chief of staff operates as a behind-the-scenes aide, ensuring the office runs smoothly. But Harrison, a Trump appointee who joined in January, wielded an unusual degree of authority.Phelan and Harrison earlier reassigned aides who were meant to support Cao after his confirmation and planned to screen all future military assistants to keep control in the secretary’s office, as cited by Politico. Cao, a well-known Navy veteran and former Republican Senate candidate from Virginia, was nominated by Trump.The move comes after Hegseth dismissed several senior aides and replaced the chair of the Joint Chiefs, along with the uniformed leaders of the Navy, Air Force , and Coast Guard earlier this year.Trump has pledged to revitalize US shipbuilding, but the Navy’s largest programs remain years behind schedule, while both allies and adversaries are outpacing American shipyards.US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would dismiss senior military leaders if they failed to meet his expectations, telling reporters ahead of a rare meeting with top officers in Quantico, Virginia.“If I don't like somebody, I'm going to fire them right on the spot,” he said.Hegseth also criticized what he called “woke” policies in the US military, ordering leaders to address “decades of decay.” He also issued directives for service members, instructing them to get fit, cut their hair, and shave their beards.",US defence secretary Pete Hegseth dismissed Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison.

The agency confirmed the earthquake occurred at a depth of 50 km.While no casualties have been reported, this is a developing story.Japan lies in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire, one of the most seismically active regions in the world. The country regularly experiences low-intensity tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Powerful earthquakes, often followed by tsunamis, strike several times each century. Major recent quakes include the 2024 Noto earthquake, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2004 Chuetsu earthquake, and the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995.The nation has the densest seismic network in the world, enabling experts to monitor and analyze a large number of earthquakes with high precision.Unlike many countries, Japan uses the Shindo scale to measure seismic intensity instead of magnitude. While the Richter scale records the energy released at the epicenter, the Shindo scale measures the degree of shaking at different locations. Comparable systems include the Modified Mercalli scale in the United States, the Liedu scale in China, and the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS), reported ANI.","Powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.0 strikes near east coast of Honshu, Japan.

Bihar Polls Heat Up As RJD Slams PM Modi Over ‘Crippling Education’ Remark

Poll Should the Bihar assembly elections be conducted in one phase? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Bihar assembly polls expected by late October, the election commission (EC) on Saturday held a meeting with all recognised political parties to discuss key aspects of the upcoming polls, including election dates and phases.The meeting was chaired by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and attended by election commissioners Dr Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Dr Vivek Joshi, chief electoral officer of Bihar Vinod Singh Gunjyal, and senior officials.The EC, while emphasising the role of political parties in a transparent democratic process, urged them to nominate polling agents at every booth to ensure smooth and fair polling. It also called upon voters to approach the elections with harmony and respect, asserting the transparency measures taken by the commission.Representatives from several parties urged that the elections be held immediately after the Chhath festival to maximise voter turnout and recommended conducting the polls in as few phases as possible to ensure efficiency, reported ANI.While political parties welcomed the decision to cap the number of voters per polling station at 1,200 and praised reforms related to postal ballot counting and the use of Form 17C, they also went on to appreciate the “historic, transparent, and firm” measures to cleanse the electoral rolls through the special intensive revision (SIR).Interestingly, SIR has been a major bone of contention between the ruling NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc.Janata Dal (United) MP Sanjay Kumar Jha called on EC to conduct a single-phase election, stressing the improved law and order situation in Bihar.Speaking after the meeting in Patna, he told reporters, “We put forward our point before the election commission. The special intensive revision (SIR) has happened in Bihar, and Bihar will show the country the way SIR is done. We have urged that elections should be held in one phase in Bihar.” He added, “Law and order in Bihar is in good condition. If elections can be held in one phase in Maharashtra, then why not in Bihar?”RJD MP Abhay Kushwaha talking to ANI said the party had made its demands clear, including holding the polls in two phases. “We have brought all the points in front of the election commission clearly. I have also provided them with suggestions that RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had in written form.”He added, “we have demanded that the elections be held in two phases. We have told them to give us a clear list of the 3,66,000 names that were removed (from the voter list), and I appeal to those whose names have been removed to file a complaint.”BJP Bihar president Dilip Jaiswal taking an aim at the opposition said that all polling agents should collect Form 17C after voting concludes to avoid post-poll disputes, “the election commission has requested political parties to ensure that their polling agents surely collect Form 17C when voting ends in the evening... Some political parties' polling agents leave early, and then the blame game begins,” he said. Jaiswal further mentioned that his party recommended elections be held immediately after the mandatory 28-day announcement period, “without any delay.”The election commission is expected to announce the Bihar assembly election dates soon.","The election commission (EC) on Saturday held a meeting with all recognised political parties to discuss key aspects of the upcoming polls.

BHUBANESWAR: Curfew was imposed and internet suspended in Cuttack city amid fresh violence on Sunday, a day after eight people, including Cuttack DCP Rishikesh Khilari, were injured in a group clash during Durga idol immersion at Dargha Bazaar.The development comes even as chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi appealed for calm while promising stringent action against those responsible for disrupting peace in Cuttack.""Curfew will remain in force for 36 hours under 13 police areas from Sunday night. There is a ban on internet and social media services for 36 hours, starting 7 pm on Sunday,"" police commissioner S Dev Datta Singh said.Police said such stringent measures were taken after 25 people, including 8 police personnel were seriously injured in a stone-pelting incident during a bike rally on Sunday evening. ""An organisation took out the bike rally despite being denied permission. When police tried to stop them, they pelted stones at us,"" Singh said, adding that a massive police deployment has been made to prevent any untoward incident. He also warned of action against miscreants for spreading hate and fake contents on social media.Earlier, Majhi expressed sorrow over the group clash and urged all citizens to maintain peace and order.""Cuttack, with its rich thousand-year history, stands as a testament to unity and brotherhood. However, in recent days, the peace in the city was disrupted by some miscreants, affecting the daily lives of ordinary people. The govt is keeping an eye on these miscreants and will take strict action against them,"" the CM's statement read.Majhi, who directed DGP Y B Khurania to head to Cuttack and camp there to prevent escalation of the situation, called on citizens to remain united and preserve the city's heritage.His appeal is particularly significant as tensions remain high following the violence, with the VHP calling for a 12-hour bandh in Cuttack on Monday.On Sunday, the commissionerate police conducted flag marches throughout the city to reassure citizens of their safety. A high-level meeting was also convened by DGP Khurania, police commissioner S Dev Datta Singh, and additional director general (law and order) Sanjay Kumar to work out a strategy on restoring peace in Cuttack.On Saturday, police had arrested six men in connection with the violence.","Eight people, including Cuttack DCP Rishikesh Khilari, were injured in a group clash during Durga idol immersion at Dargha Bazaar.

'Westerly winds brought system closer to state'





KOLKATA: An unexpected change in the trajectory of a low-pressure system, brought on by a retreating monsoon, was responsible for the devastating rain that crippled the north Bengal plains and hills.The system, which formed over Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, hit land in Odisha as a depression and was sailing north-northwestward towards Chhattisgarh when it suddenly recurved towards north Bihar, coming dangerously close to north Bengal.Despite gradual weakening since entering land, the system was strong enough to dump heavy rain on Kalimpong, Kurseong, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling, flooding vast swathes of north Bengal.The system weakened into a 'well-marked low-pressure area' on Saturday and was hovering over north-east Bihar as a cyclonic circulation on Sunday. Meteorologists said the system was headed towards Chhattisgarh on Friday when it suddenly took a north-eastern turn due to strong westerly winds.""Since the monsoon is now retreating from north India, there were strong westerly winds that diverted the system towards north Bihar, bringing it closer to north Bengal.It was prevented from approaching central India... The 'recurve' was unexpected but not unusual,"" said a meteorologist.The system moved towards N Bihar while it was still a 'well-marked low-pressure' belt. ""Though not very intense, these systems spread across a wide region. North Bengal fell within its periphery. In fact, Kolkata, too, continues to be impacted by the system,"" he said. Even though it weakened into a low-pressure area from depression, it affected N Bengal significantly due to strong winds and moisture incursion, said Sourish Bandopadhyay, RMC scientist.","The system, which formed over Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, hit land in Odisha as a depression.

GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday issued an ultimatum to eight Assamese individuals living in Singapore, who were present on the yacht with Zubeen Garg on the day of his death, to appear before the Assam Police SIT by Monday, warning that failure to comply will prompt the govt to take the toughest possible stand.Alleged to have died from accidental drowning, the probe involving Zubeen’s death took a dramatic turn on Saturday after arrested co-suspect and his bandmember Shekhar Jyoti Goswami alleged before the SIT that the late singer’s manager Sidharth Sharma and North East India festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta had poisoned Zubeen during the yacht outing. The eight individuals are believed to be key witnesses in unfolding of the case.The SIT had earlier issued summons to these eight individuals, asking them to appear within 10 days — a deadline that expires on Monday. Sarma emphasized that their cooperation was essential in cracking the case.“Our police cannot go to Singapore to bring them here. We have to bring them through a system. It completely depends on them. If they don’t come by Oct 6, we will be as tough as possible,” Sarma said.The CM also said the probe was progressing in the right direction.“No one has been given VIP treatment. People are satisfied with the progress,” he added. The SIT has so far arrested four individuals linked to Zubeen’s death, including Mahanta, Sharma and two of his band members — Goswami and Amritprabha Mahanta.Clarifying that Zubeen’s post-mortem report will not be made public, the CM said, “Making it public will have no relevance or admissibility in court. If anyone wishes to see it, he can visit the CID office and review it there,” before citing the example of AJP leader Lurinjyoti Gogoi, who has been demanding that the reports should be made public.Zubeen’s wife, Garima Saikia Garg, on Saturday returned the post-mortem report conducted at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) to the SIT, stating that she does not want to keep any documents when the investigation is on. Garima had earlier received the first autopsy report from Singapore, which stated that Zubeen died by drowning, while swimming in the sea, as per the official death certificate.Meanwhile, the viscera report from the central forensic science laboratory in New Delhi is expected by Oct 10. If the result shows the presence of any toxic substances, it could transform the case from an accidental death to a homicidal one, triggering deeper legal consequences for those involved.","Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma issued an ultimatum to eight Assamese individuals living in Singapore, who were present on the yacht with Zubeen Garg on the day of his death.

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure.

On Saturday, the same judge temporarily blocked the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland.A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalised members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland.

BHOPAL: A family of four from Kota, Rajasthan, narrowly escaped death after their car was hit from behind by a truck and plunged into the Sindh River along the Shivpuri-Jhansi four-lane highway in Madhya Pradesh.The accident occurred near the Amola Bridge in the jurisdiction of Amola Police Station, Shivpuri district.The family — en route to Orai, Uttar Pradesh, to attend a Baba Jai Gurudev Satsang — was saved by local villagers who risked their own lives by jumping into the river and pulling the victims from the submerged vehicle.According to eyewitnesses, the car had just crossed the Amola Bridge and was approaching a stone crusher site when it was suddenly rear-ended by a speeding truck.The impact caused the car to veer off the road and fall directly into a dam section of the Sindh River, where the water is estimated to be 8 to 10 feet deep.The vehicle was carrying Shailendra Singh Handa, his wife Rekha Kanwar, and their children Nodigh Handa and Devdutt Handa, all residents of Kota. As the car began to sink, nearby villagers rushed to the scene and immediately sprang into action.Four villagers — Manoj Kalawat, Gopal Parihar, Sukhdev Lodhi, and Rakesh Mistry — jumped into the water.Battling the current and murky conditions, they managed to pull all four family members out safely.Passersby and locals quickly gathered, and emergency services were alerted.The Amola Police arrived shortly after and have launched a search for the truck driver, who fled the scene after the accident.","A family of four from Kota, Rajasthan, narrowly escaped death after their car was hit from behind by a truck and plunged into the Sindh River.

'Got to take credit': Trump says he warned about Osama bin Laden a year before 9/11; claims it was ignored,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/got-to-take-credit-trump-says-he-warned-about-osama-bin-laden-a-year-before-9/11-claims-it-was-ignored/articleshow/124328749.cms,"Trump’s Face Shows Noticeable Droop at 9/11 Event, Sparking Stroke Concerns Amid Death Rumors





US President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that he foresaw Osama bin Laden as a threat to America before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, saying he had written about the al-Qaeda leader in one of his books.Speaking before a gathering of Navy personnel in Norfolk, Virginia, during the Navy’s 250th anniversary celebrations, Trump said: “And history will never forget that it was the SEALs who stormed the compound at Osama bin Laden and put a bullet in his head, remember that?”He went on to recall that he had written about bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks, claiming credit for his foresight. “And please remember I wrote about Osama bin Lady exactly one year… before he blew up the World Trade Center. And I said, ‘You gotta watch Osama bin Laden.’ And the fake news would never let me get away with that statement unless it was true. But I said, ‘One year before,’ to Pete Hegseth. I said, ‘One year before,’ where’s Pete?” Trump asked while looking at the crowd.According to CNN, the US president’s book was titled “The America We Deserve” and was published in January 2000 in which Osama was mentioned.The MAGA leader continued: “But in the book, whatever the hell the title, I can’t tell ya, but I can tell you there’s a page in there devoted to the fact that I saw somebody named Osama Bin Laden and I didn’t like it and you have to take care of him.They didn’t do it. A year later, he blew up the World Trade Center. So, we’re gonna take a little credit, because nobody else is going to give it to me. You know the old story, if they don’t give you credit, just take it yourself. ”Trump has repeated such claims before, including after announcing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s death. At the time, he said he had warned of bin Laden in his “very successful” book, CNN reported.“I said, ‘You have to kill him. You have to take him out.’ Nobody listened to me. Let’s put it this way: if they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different,” he said.Osama bin Laden was killed on May 2, 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, during a covert raid by US Navy SEALs. The operation, known as Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by then US President Barack Obama","US President Donald Trump claimed that he foresaw Osama bin Laden as a threat to America before the 9/11 attacks.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Why is Moroccan youth protesting?





Moroccan protests driven by teenagers and internet-savvy youth has turned deadly as authorities on Thursday raised the death toll to 3 as violent youth-led demonstrations over corruption and public spending continue to rock the country.Morocco’s Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks, as organisers called for a sixth night of protests. “The death toll in the protests has risen to three,” Akhannouch said in a statement. ""We have unfortunately recorded the deaths of three people"" during the protests, Akhannouch said, describing the events as ""regrettable"", AFP reported.Local authorities reported that security forces had to resort to firearms after teargas failed to stop demonstrators from storming a police facility in Leqliaa, a small town outside Agadir. The group, armed with knives, set fire to part of the facility and to a vehicle.According to Morocco’s Interior Ministry, the three were shot and killed during an attempt to seize police weapons, although no witnesses could corroborate the report.The ministry added that 354 people, mostly law enforcement personnel, were injured, while hundreds of cars, banks, shops, and public buildings were damaged across 23 provinces.The protests dominated by Gen Z participants have taken Morocco by surprise. Demonstrators have voiced frustration over widespread corruption, contrasting the billions invested in preparations for the 2030 World Cup with underfunded schools and hospitals. Chants have included slogans such as, “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?”The unrest has been further fueled by the recent deaths of eight women in a public hospital in Agadir, which has become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s healthcare system.While the country prepares to host soccer's Africa Cup of Nations later this year and gears up for parliamentary elections in 2026, the protests highlight enduring regional disparities and dissatisfaction with public services, particularly among youth.Officials, however, denied that World Cup-related spending has taken precedence over public infrastructure, noting that many challenges facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.","Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks.

Shutdown or not, the show goes on — and so does the Trump dance. In Norfolk, Virginia, the Navy’s 250th anniversary bash turned into a spectacle Sunday when US President Donald Trump capped his speech with his trademark moves to ‘YMCA,’ sending a crowd of 10,000 roaring with delight.The shutdown has resulted in thousands of federal employees being furloughed and has delayed key projects in Democratic-run areas such as New York and Chicago.Trump criticised Democrats for the impasse, assuring that service members would receive their full pay despite the stalemate. Senate Democrats, however, expressed concerns over healthcare subsidies, Medicaid cuts, and spending priorities, leading them to reject efforts to extend government operations.During the celebration, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited the USS George HW Bush, where they met with sailors, distributed challenge coins, and observed military demonstrations.“Let’s face it, this is a rally,” President Donald J. Trump told a crowd of approximately 10,000 sailors dressed in white uniforms on Sunday.The event took place on a pier situated between two towering Navy vessels, an aircraft carrier and an amphibious assault ship.A Navy fighter jet, bearing the inscription “President Donald J. Trump ‘45-47’” on its fuselage beneath the cockpit window, was displayed on the carrier.Navy planes flew overhead as the President commenced his speech, energising the crowd and prompting many sailors to chant “USA! USA! USA!”Trump criticised his political opponents and attacked Democratic lawmakers amidst a government shutdown entering its fifth day. The shutdown has resulted in military personnel working without pay until the government reopens.“I want you to know that despite the current Democrat induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny. Don’t worry about it,"" Trump assured, receiving cheers from the audience.Addressing the generals, Trump proposed utilising US cities as training grounds for the armed forces and emphasised the necessity of military strength to combat what he described as the “invasion from within.”Hegseth declared an end to “woke” culture and announced new directives for troops, including “gender-neutral” and “male-level” standards for physical fitness. The administration is endeavouring to reshape Pentagon culture and deploy military resources to advance the President’s priorities, which include suppressing domestic unrest and violent crime.Additionally, Trump has involved the military in armed conflict with drug cartels, resulting in four strikes on boats in the Caribbean that Washington claims were engaged in trafficking.","President Donald J.
