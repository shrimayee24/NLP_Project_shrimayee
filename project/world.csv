and Michele Bachmann, both known for their far-right views. Gor later became deputy chief of staff to senator Rand Paul. Gor joined Trump’s orbit during the 2020 elections, rose quickly in the MAGA movement, and was appointed director of presidential personnel after Trump’s 2024 victory. Trump credits him with placing nearly 4,000 loyalists in government roles.

Gor is known for his loyalty to Trump but has also been criticised by others as unpredictable in his decisions. He clashed with Elon Musk, Trump’s billionaire adviser.

He also played a role in derailing Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead Nasa after pointing out Isaacman’s past donations to Democrats.

US president Donald Trump has nominated Sergio Gor as the next American ambassador to India. If confirmed by the Senate, Gor will also serve as special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs, a region that includes Pakistan and Bangladesh where the US currently has no ambassadors.Trump announced the move on social media, calling Gor a “great friend” and someone he could fully trust to deliver on his agenda. “For the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible ambassador,” Trump wrote.Gor will replace Eric Garcetti, a Democratic appointee, who returned to California after the end of the Biden presidency.","Sergio Gor was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, when it was part of the Soviet Union.

Around 77 govt employees have been sacked by the J&K LG so far under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution, underlining a zero tolerance approach for both terrorism and the terror eco-system active in the UT.As per the secret dossier on Khurshid, he was appointed as a teacher in 2003 but was working as an overground worker for LeT. He was tasked by LeT handlers to procure arms, ammunition and narcotics for further distribution among active terrorists operating in the valley.Khurshid was in touch with Pakistan-based terrorists Manzoor Ahmed Sheikh alias Shakoor and Javid Ahmed. The investigators found Khurshid had received several consignments containing weapons and narcotics sent across the LoC into Karnah, Kupwara.""Khurshid's role was exposed after the law enforcement agencies received an input on Jan 25, 2024 that two Pakistani terrorists were involved in smuggling of arms with the help of four associates in Kupwara - Khurshid himself, Zahoor Ahmed, Ghulam Sarwar and Qazi Fazal.An FIR was registered and Zahoor Ahmed picked for interrogation. Zahoor spilled the beans on his network and his associates, leading to the arrest of Khurshid and his aides. Sustained interrogation of Khurshid and his associates led to the recovery of a huge cache of arms and ammunition. Siyad was appointed as an assistant stockman in the sheep husbandry department in 2004. He started working for LeT and was tasked to receive infiltrating groups of terrorists, shelter them and transport their arms and ammunition.According to investigators, Siyad also started smuggling narcotics to sustain terror activities.

KOLKATA: In another life, Sunali Khatun could have been a version of Manto's Toba Tek Singh, a man with no country to call his own. Pushed into Bangladesh by police in India who labelled her an illegal immigrant, police in Bangladesh have now done the same thing to her - called her an illegal immigrant and jailed her. She is eight months pregnant.Birbhum resident Sunali, expecting a child any time now, was escorted into a Bangladesh jail on Friday not knowing to which country her unborn baby would belong.The 26-year-old's Aadhaar and voter identity card hadn't saved her from being branded an ""illegal immigrant"" in Delhi, where she was working until recently. On Thursday, cops in Chapai Nawabganj arrested her based on those very identity documents.Sunali, her ragpicker husband Danish Sheikh and the couple's toddler son Sabir are now among six ""nowhere people"" with roots in West Bengal but disowned by their country and incarcerated in Bangladesh. The others are Sweety Biwi and her sons Qurban Sheikh (16) and Imam Dewan (6).The befuddled bunch had been living and working in Delhi's Rohini - earning just enough to keep afloat - when they were arrested during an ""identity verification drive"" and sent to Bangladesh through Assam on June 26.""The group of six was arrested after they were found loitering in Chapai Nawabganj. They told us they were Indians who entered Bangladesh through the Kurigram border (in Assam), roamed the streets of Dhaka for some days, and then reached here. They didn't have a lawyer during Friday's court hearing,"" Chapai Nawabganj police superintendent Md Rezaul Karim told TOI on Friday.Unless someone takes up cudgels for them, Sunali, her family and the rest of the group will remain in prison till the next hearing scheduled in September. Karim said all six had been charged under the Control of Entry Act, 1952.Sunali's father Bhodu Sk, who has filed a habeas corpus in Calcutta high court, said it was shocking to even think that his heavily pregnant daughter might give birth in jail. ""We are poor. We have moved the high court, what else can be done?"" he said.Arif Sk, a neighbour of the family in Bengal's Birbhum, said everyone has pooled in to try and arrange a lawyer in Bangladesh to bail out the group from their village.Bhodu and co-petitioner Amir Khan, who is Sweety Khatun's cousin, said in their petition that what happened was a ""betrayal of law"". The high court is scheduled to hear the case on Sept 10.A PIL has been filed in Supreme Court on the alleged harassment of Bengali-speaking migrants in India, including Sunali's ""illegal deportation"". The PIL has been listed for hearing on Aug 29.Bengal migrant welfare board chairperson and Rajya Sabha MP Samirul Islam said, ""We are making every effort to bring back Sunali and the others. We are also providing the family legal help.""Meanwhile, on Aug 13, 22-year-old Malda migrant labourer Amir Sheikh, who was pushed into Bangladesh on June 25, returned to India, his reappearance as mysterious as his disappearance from the country of his birth. Amir had been stuck in Bangladesh since June 25, prompting his father - Jiyem Sheikh - to file a habeas corpus in the HC. He said Rajasthan Police had arrested him for being a ""Bangladeshi living in India illegally"".BSF told the court a couple of hours after Amir's return through the Basirhat border that he had crossed over to Bangladesh ""inadvertently"".","Sunali Khatun, 26, was arrested in Chapai Nawabganj, Bangladesh, on Thursday.

Despite a four-page complaint signed by 42 doctors, the MS has not forwarded it to police,” he said. He added that assault on a doctor is a non-bailable offense, and the MS has no authority to “settle” such a crime.AAP Vice President Sanjeev Jha called the MS’s stance “highly condemnable,” accusing her of colluding with BJP to shield the MLA.

NEW DELHI: Expelled RJD leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav on Thursday alleged that five powerful families conspired against him to destroy both his political and personal life.The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.“Five families together and in a broader conspiracy tried to end my political life. In my more than ten years of political life, I have never wronged anyone, nor have I ever conspired against anyone. But these five families have made every effort to destroy my political and family life completely,” Tej Pratap wrote on X.He further said, “Tomorrow (Friday), I will bring the faces and characters of all five families before the public. I am going to expose each of their conspiracies tomorrow.”On Wednesday, Tej Pratap had also posted, “Five people worked together to completely ruin my life...

Tej Pratap later alleged that his Facebook account had been hacked and that the post was part of a conspiracy against him.Following his expulsion, Tej Pratap launched a separate political outfit under the banner of ‘Team Tej Pratap Yadav’ and aligned with five smaller parties to contest the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly elections. He has been campaigning aggressively across the state, often calling his rivals “Jaychand” (traitors).Lalu Prasad earlier in May had justified the expulsion by saying, “Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Tej Pratap’s younger brother and leader of opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, had said at the time that while the party would not tolerate such controversies, his brother was “an adult and free to make decisions.”",The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.

Alleged Discord conversations between Destiny and Rose gain traction

Destiny responds: “She told me she was 19”

Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known as Destiny, has become the center of controversy after serious allegations emerged online. The popular streamer and political commentator is being accused of sharing sexually explicit messages with an individual identified as “Rose,” who was allegedly 17 at the time of their interactions.On August 20, 2025, Kick streamershared screenshots from Destiny’s own chatroom that appeared to show him referencing Rose while taunting critics. In the leaked posts, Destiny dismissed concerns that he was “hiding stuff” and even mentioned details about Rose’s college, which many claimed could have led to her being doxed.The casual tone of his remarks only fueled speculation. Critics argued that his comments revealed not only recklessness but also a pattern of minimizing accusations against him.Later that same day, additional screenshots circulated online, this time allegedly from Discord. Shared by user @KweenInYellow, the messages appeared to show explicit exchanges between Destiny and Rose dating back to 2022.The screenshots, if accurate, included sexual references and raised alarm because of Rose’s reported age at the time.These images spread rapidly across X and Reddit, with fans and critics dissecting their authenticity.Some pointed out that dates and usernames seemed consistent with Destiny’s past accounts, while others cautioned against drawing conclusions without verified sources.As the storm escalated, Destiny addressed the allegations in his own chatroom on August 20. He claimed Rose had told him she was 19 at the time of their conversations and insisted there were logs that could back up his version.He also pointed to claims that Rose had produced large amounts of adult content, arguing that this complicated the narrative being pushed against him.The allegations have dominated online discussions in the streaming world, with reactions deeply divided. Some people are in favor of Destiny and are backing the streamers with facts and their own theories, while others are thrashing him all over social media for his questionable actions with minors.As of this writing, there has been no official action from any official body against Destiny. However, social media has been buzzing with their perspectives on the matter.","Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known as Destiny, has become the center of controversy after serious allegations emerged online.

Will Vladimir Putin attend the World Cup?

US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Washington's Kennedy Center will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on December 5, during an Oval Office meeting with FIFA President Gianni Infantino where Trump playfully asked to keep the World Cup trophy and suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin might attend the tournament.The 48-team tournament's draw venue announcement comes after Trump recently installed himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, claiming to combat ""woke"" culture at the venue.Infantino brought the World Cup trophy to the White House for the announcement, allowing Trump to hold it.""Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it's for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course you can as well touch it,"" Infantino said.""Can I keep it?

‘Continue to pose an unreasonable risk’: Erik Menendez denied parole after nearly 36 years in prison for parents’ murders; misconduct behind bars cited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/continue-to-pose-an-unreasonable-risk-erik-menendez-denied-parole-after-nearly-36-years-in-prison-for-parents-murders-misconduct-in-prison-cited/articleshow/123445045.cms,"Erik Menendez appears before the parole board via teleconference (Picture credit: AP)





California parole commissioners have denied Erik Menendez’s request for release, saying his misconduct behind bars showed he remains a risk to public safety.The 54-year-old, who, along with his brother Lyle, murdered their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989, faced his first parole hearing on Thursday.A two-member board ruled he will not be eligible again for another three years, as per news agency AP.Commissioner Robert Barton told him, “Contrary to your supporters’ beliefs, you have not been a model prisoner, and frankly, we find that a little disturbing.” He said repeated violations, particularly illegal use of mobile phones, showed a “selfish” attitude and belief that rules did not apply to him.According to ABC News, Barton noted that Erik’s behaviour in prison, including inappropriate contact with visitors, drug smuggling, misuse of computers and violent incidents, was the primary reason for the decision, rather than the gravity of the crime.“We find that you continue to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety,” he said, as quoted by ABC News.The hearing, which lasted nearly 10 hours, came 36 years and one day after the killings. “Today is the day all my victims learned my parents were dead,” Erik told the panel.Relatives, many of whom have forgiven him, gave emotional statements urging his release. His aunt Teresita Menendez-Baralt, battling cancer, said, “More than anything, I hope I live long enough to welcome him into my home.”Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life without parole in 1996, but a judge in May resentenced them to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible under youth offender laws.Los Angeles County district attorney Nathan Hochman opposed parole, arguing the brothers “have not demonstrated full insight into their crimes.” According to AP, he compared them to Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F Kennedy, who was also denied release over lack of insight.Lyle Menendez, now 57, is due for his parole hearing on Friday.","Erik and Lyle Menendez murdered their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989.

‘Massive sanctions or tariffs’: Trump’s big warning on Russia-Ukraine war; sets two-week deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/massive-sanctions-or-tariffs-trumps-big-warning-on-russia-ukraine-war-sets-two-week-deadline/articleshow/123465301.cms,"US President Donald Trump has given Russia and Ukraine a “two-week” deadline, saying he will decide soon whether to impose “massive sanctions,” “massive tariffs”. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump said: “In two weeks, we will know which way I'm going. Because I will go one way or the other, and I'll learn which way I'm going. That’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both. Or do we do nothing and say it’s your fight.”The remarks came as hopes for a Russia-Ukraine summit dimmed, with Moscow pouring cold water on peace efforts and Kyiv accusing the Kremlin of dragging out the war.Earlier in the week, Trump had suggested that Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy were prepared to meet face-to-face, but on Friday he likened them to “oil and vinegar.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed “no meeting” was planned, while Zelensky accused Moscow of “trying to wriggle out of holding a meeting.”Trump’s comments come as his administration weighs additional tariffs and sanctions against countries seen as enabling Russia’s war effort.His trade adviser Peter Navarro recently accused India of acting as a “laundromat for the Kremlin” by refining Russian oil and reselling it globally, linking the practice to Moscow’s ability to fund its military campaign.New Delhi rejected the claims, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar calling the logic “perplexing” and defending imports as vital to India’s energy security.Trump, wearing a red cap with the slogan “Trump was right about everything,” said, “It takes two to tango,” as he left open the possibility of stepping up economic pressure on Moscow. He also displayed a photo sent by Putin after their summit in Alaska last week and said he might invite the Russian leader to the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States if progress is made on Ukraine.The question of security guarantees for Ukraine remains unresolved, with Trump claiming Russia had agreed to “some Western security guarantees” for Kyiv, only for Lavrov to dismiss the idea as “a road to nowhere.” Zelensky, speaking in Kyiv alongside NATO’s Mark Rutte, argued that only foreign troops and firm guarantees could deter Russia from future aggression.The war, now in its fourth year, has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions. Moscow has consistently opposed any NATO role in Ukraine, citing it as a reason for its invasion. Ukraine, meanwhile, points to Russia’s violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum — in which Moscow pledged to respect its sovereignty in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons — as evidence that strong guarantees are essential.Trump’s comments come as his administration weighs additional tariffs and sanctions against countries seen as enabling Russia’s war effort.

A powerful explosion and fire at an automotive supply company in southeast Louisiana forced evacuations on Friday, sending huge flames and a towering column of thick black smoke into the sky above rural communities.The blaze broke out at Smitty’s Supply, a plant that manufactures lubricants and automotive fluids, just north of the town of Roseland in Tangipahoa Parish, according to news agency AP.Local officials said no injuries have been reported, but everyone living within a one-mile radius was ordered to leave their homes.A nearby elementary school was also evacuated.Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said it was a “godsend” that no one had been hurt. “We are doing our best to protect people, structures and the environment,” he told reporters, as crews spent hours battling the inferno, reported AP.Videos of the incident going viral on social media showed bright orange flames leaping through the facility, contrasted against a thick black plume of smoke visible for miles.More than 35 agencies, including the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), responded to the emergency.LDEQ said it was monitoring air quality around the site. “All readings are zero at this time,” the agency stated, adding that the EPA had dispatched contractors for additional support, as per The Independent.The Tangipahoa Parish School System confirmed that Roseland Montessori School had been evacuated, with students bussed to a reunification site at the central office. “We are relieved to report that all Roseland Montessori students and staff have been accounted for and have returned home safe and sound,” superintendent Melissa Martin Stilley said, as cited by The Independent.According to Fox 26 Houston, the fire was first reported shortly before 1 pm CST. Multiple nearby roads were closed, and a shelter was opened at the Amite Community Center on West Chestnut Street to assist evacuees.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry posted on X that the situation was being closely monitored. “We are praying for everyone’s safety,” he wrote.Authorities said the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, and it is unclear how long it will take to bring the fire fully under control.","Blaze broke out at Smitty's Supply, a plant that manufactures lubricants and automotive fluids.

Many victims from India, China and the Philippines



Shock and mourning







A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, on Friday afternoon, killing five passengers and injuring dozens more. Authorities say the driver became distracted and lost control before overcorrecting, causing the bus to veer off the road and roll onto its side, news agency AP reported.Major Andre Ray of the New York State Police confirmed that the dead were all adults, with passengers ranging in age from one to 74. Many victims were thrown from the vehicle, and several became trapped beneath the wreckage before being pulled to safety. Rescue operations continued for hours, with helicopters and ambulances transporting more than 40 people to nearby hospitals.Police said mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out, making distraction the most likely cause of the crash. “The operator became distracted, lost control and overcorrected,” Ray explained, as quoted by AP.The bus, operated by M&Y Tour Inc. of Staten Island, had no record of previous accidents in the past two years and carried a “satisfactory” federal safety rating.The driver survived and is cooperating with investigators.The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to assist in examining the crash, which occurred around 12:30 p.m. on the busy New York State Thruway. Witnesses reported seeing the bus swerve into the median before crossing to the shoulder and overturning.Authorities said most of the passengers were of Indian, Chinese and Filipino background, and translators were brought to the scene to aid emergency services. Lists provided by the company confirmed 54 people were on board, including the driver and a tour company employee.At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, 24 patients were treated for serious trauma, including head injuries and broken bones. “It’s probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo,” said Dr Samuel Cloud, the hospital’s chief medical officer. Other patients were flown to the University of Rochester Medical Center, where two remained in critical condition.Officials believe many passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. New York law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 2016, though the age of the bus has not been confirmed.Governor Kathy Hochul described the accident as a “tragedy” and said her office was working closely with police and local officials. “Our hearts are with their loved ones during this difficult time,” she said.Eyewitnesses reported seeing shattered glass and belongings scattered across the highway. “It was heartbreaking to see. People were embracing each other, breaking down,” said Powell Stephens, who drove past the scene.The crash left eastbound lanes of the Thruway closed for hours as investigators worked to clear the wreckage.","A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, on Friday afternoon.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard to the city, calling the plan “uncoordinated, uncalled for and unsound”.Speaking on Friday, Trump described Chicago as “a mess” and singled out Johnson as “an incompetent mayor.” He said Chicago could be the “next” city to face a federal crackdown following Washington, DC, where about 2,000 National Guard troops have already been deployed.“The people in Chicago … are screaming for us to come,” Trump said, adding that action would begin “when we’re ready.”As quoted by NBC Chicago, Johnson dismissed those remarks, insisting the city has seen sharp crime declines without military intervention. “We have grave concerns about the impact of any unlawful deployment of National Guard troops to the City of Chicago,” the mayor said in a statement.He warned that such a move “has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust … is foundational to building safer communities.”Johnson noted the city has seen a 30% drop in homicides, 35% in robberies, and nearly 40% in shootings over the past year.“We need to continue to invest in what is working,” Johnson said, highlighting investments in housing, education, and community safety initiatives. “The National Guard will not alleviate the housing crisis… It will not fully fund our public schools or provide mental healthcare… The National Guard is no substitute for dedicated local law enforcement and community violence interrupters.”Johnson stated that if Trump aims to enhance safety in the city, he ought to reinstate the $158 million he eliminated from violence-prevention initiatives for cities like Chicago.""There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,"" he said.As per news agency AP, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also criticised Trump’s plan, arguing the Posse Comitatus Act prevents such use of federal troops. “It’s clear to me he does not have the legal right or ability to do that,” he said earlier this month.Democratic Senator Dick Durbin called Trump’s tactics “political theatre,” while Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Army National Guard veteran, accused him of misusing the military to “intimidate Americans in our own communities.”As per The New York Times, Trump has greater control in Washington due to its federal status, but his authority in Chicago is more limited. Analysts note he could still attempt to send in federal law enforcement or invoke the Insurrection Act, a move previously floated but never used.","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard to the city.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose wrongful deportation earlier this year became a flashpoint in US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, was released Friday from a Tennessee jail to rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador because of a “well-founded fear” of gang violence.He was sent to a notorious maximum-security prison before being flown back to the US in June under a court order. Within days of his return, he was arrested and charged with transporting undocumented migrants.On Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the Putnam County jail dressed in jeans and a white button-down short-sleeved shirt alongside his lawyer, Rascoe Dean. He did not speak to reporters and departed swiftly in a waiting SUV, as per news agency AP.His release order requires him to travel directly to Maryland, where he will live under home detention with his brother designated as custodian, and submit to electronic monitoring. He’ll be able to leave home only for approved activities.Defense attorney Sean Hecker said his client had been “unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government’s vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back”, according to news agency AFP.Another attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, noted that Abrego Garcia had been reunited with his family for the first time since March but warned he was “far from safe,” citing the risk of deportation to a third country.The department of homeland security has signalled plans to remove him to an unnamed nation, with options such as Uganda, Mexico, or South Sudan under discussion, news agency Reuters reported. A Maryland judge has ordered that his lawyers be given 72 hours’ notice before any such deportation so they can challenge it.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges linked to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop where officers found nine passengers in his car but released him with only a warning. His trial is set for January 2027.Trump administration officials have strongly condemned his release. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem branded him a “monster” and vowed, “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country”.Deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson also described him as a “criminal illegal alien” and MS-13 member, calling his release an “insult to his victims”.Despite the political firestorm, Abrego Garcia remains under court protection. Maryland Governor Wes Moore said the case underscored the principle that “every person is afforded their right to due process” in the US.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador.

And this agenda is not ready at all,"" Lavrov said.Lavrov said Russia had agreed to show flexibility on a number of issues raised by US President Trump at a US-Russia summit, but accused Ukraine of not showing the same flexibility in talks with Trump and European allies that followed. ""He (Trump) clearly indicated - it was very clear to everybody that there are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no Nato membership (for Ukraine), including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelensky said no to everything,"" said Lavrov. ""He even said no to...cancelling legislation banning the Russian language. How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?""Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Friday Russia was doing everything it could to stop a meeting between him and Putin from taking place, and urged Ukraine's allies to put fresh sanctions on Moscow if it shows no interest in peace.Speaking at a joint press conference with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said they had discussed security guarantees for Ukraine by other states.There are ""two layers"" of guarantees being discussed, Rutte said, adding the first is to make Ukraine's army stronger and second involves guarantees from allies. agencies",Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov says there is no agenda for a potential summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.

The New Dare to Discipline

When God Doesn’t Make Sense





Dr James Dobson, founder of the conservative Christian ministry 'Focus on the Family' and an influential US evangelical leader died on Thursday, at the age of 89.Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1936, Dobson was an influential voice in American politics. Trained as a child psychologist, he launched a radio show on parenting that grew into Focus on the Family in 1977.The ministry became one of the largest evangelical organizations in the world, employing more than 1,000 people. The radio show was broadcasted in 27 languages across 160 countries.His influence extended deep into politics. Dobson advised or counseled five US presidents — Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Donald Trump. He was part of Trump’s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board in 2016 and later praised him for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who overturned federal abortion rights in 2022.Dobson authored more than 70 books, including the controversialand, and was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. His daily broadcast once aired on more than 4,000 stations, making him one of the most widely heard Christian voices globally.A staunch opponent of abortion, pornography and same-sex marriage, Dobson was a leading figure in shaping evangelical activism around issues of family and morality. In 1985, he interviewed President Reagan in the Oval Office, and by 1989, televangelist Jerry Falwell had described him as a “rising star.”Focus on the Family, headquartered in Colorado Springs since 1991, became a platform for Dobson to campaign on social policy and mobilize evangelical voters. His work, the James Dobson Family Institute noted, was dedicated to “strengthening marriages, guiding parents and defending biblical values.”Dobson is survived by his wife of 64 years, Shirley, their children Danae and Ryan, daughter-in-law Laura and two grandchildren.","Dr James Dobson, founder of the conservative Christian ministry 'Focus on the Family' and an influential US evangelical leader died on Thursday, at the age of 89.

Watch Colombia Leader Shot During Public Address; Shock Assassination Bid On Presidential Hopeful





Colombia endured one of its bloodiest days in recent months on Thursday after a police helicopter was shot down in Antioquia and a car bomb ripped through the city of Cali, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens more.President Gustavo Petro said on X that eight police officers died when their helicopter came under attack during an operation to eradicate coca crops, the raw material used to produce cocaine.According to news agency AP, the aircraft was hit by a drone and caught fire before crashing, as per defence minister Pedro Sánchez. Antioquia Governor Andrés Julián confirmed the strike occurred as the helicopter flew over coca fields.Authorities said several others were injured in the incident, though their conditions were not immediately released.Videos circulating on social media showed the helicopter engulfed in black smoke as it crashed to the ground.Just hours later, a vehicle packed with explosives detonated outside a military aviation school in Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city. Officials confirmed five people were killed and more than 30 were wounded.Cali’s mayor, Alejandro Eder, said 36 were injured and announced a temporary ban on large trucks entering the city, along with a $10,000 reward for information.“There were fatalities among people passing by on the avenue,” eyewitness Alexis Atizabal was quoted as saying by AFP, describing widespread destruction across nearby homes and schools.Petro initially suggested the powerful Gulf Clan drug cartel was behind the helicopter attack, saying it could have been retaliation for a cocaine seizure. However, he later blamed dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), particularly the Central General Staff (EMC) led by warlord Iván Mordisco.He vowed to designate EMC, Segunda Marquetalia and the Clan del Golfo as terrorist organisations.Bloomberg reported Petro warning that EMC fighters carried out both the helicopter strike and the Cali bombing. The president, who came to power in 2022 promising “total peace” through dialogue with armed groups, has faced criticism that his softer approach has emboldened guerrillas and cartels.According to the United Nations, coca cultivation in Colombia hit a record 253,000 hectares in 2023. Experts say the rise in production, along with escalating violence, signals that armed groups are regaining power despite the 2016 peace deal with FARC.Neighbouring communities fear a return to the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when cartel bombings and political killings were common.“Our country is going through the darkest, saddest, and most painful days,” said María Claudia Tarazona, widow of assassinated presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, during his funeral earlier this month, reported AFP.","Eight police officers killed when helicopter came under attack during operation to eradicate coca crops.

Russian president Vladimir Putin expressed optimism about ties with the United States, while Donald Trump grew jittery that the Alaska Summit might end in stalemate, as both Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy dug in their heels on a one-on-one meeting.Acknowledging Moscow's all-time low relationship with Washington, Putin said ""there is a light at the end of the tunnel now that President (Donald) Trump has come to power.""As for our relations with the United States, they are at an extremely low level. I have said this many times. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel now that President (Donald) Trump has come to power,” Putin said, according to news agency PTI, in televised remarks during a meeting with nuclear industry workers in the town of Sarov, the birthplace of the Soviet atomic programme.Meanwhile, Trump, who had been pompous about ending the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours, appeared clueless over the three-year-long conflict and said, ""I think over the next two weeks, we're going to find out which way it's going to go"".Trump said he was not happy about the war and that he ""be better happy"" after two weeks.""I'm not happy about anything about that war — nothing...

He raised the possibility of imposing new sanctions or tariffs on Russia, a threat he has previously floated but not followed through on.“We’re going to see whether or not they have a meeting,” Trump told reporters in an Oval Office appearance. “It’ll be interesting to see. If they don’t, why didn’t they have a meeting, because I told them to have a meeting. But I’ll know what I am going to do in two weeks.”Relations between Moscow and Washington have sharply deteriorated over issues ranging from the Ukraine conflict, Nato's eastward expansion, and sanctions against Russia.Putin said Russia and the US are discussing the possibility of working together in the Arctic and Alaska.“We are discussing with our American partners the possibility of working together in this field, not only in our Arctic zone but also in Alaska,” he said.Earlier, Putin had endorsed Trump’s claim after the Alaska Summit on August 15 that the Ukraine war would not have started if he had been in the White House.","Russian president Vladimir Putin expressed optimism about ties with the United States.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he expects clarity within two weeks on whether Russia and Ukraine will move towards a ceasefire, while expressing deep frustration over Moscow’s continued strikes.Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump made clear he was dissatisfied with the current state of the conflict and hinted at a major decision ahead.""I'm not happy about it and I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war,"" Trump told reporters, after condemning a Russian strike that hit a US-owned factory in Ukraine on Thursday.""I said I settled seven wars and actually, if you think about Pre-wars, add three more, so it would be 10. I thought this would be in the middle of the pack in terms of difficulty. I'm not happy about anything about that war. Nothing. Not happy at all. We'll see what happens.

They don't get along too well, for obvious reasons,"" he remarked.The Kremlin, however, dismissed talk of an imminent meeting. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said, “There is no meeting planned” between the two leaders, despite Trump’s claims that arrangements had begun.

TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump on Friday nominated Tashkent-born Sergio Gor, a close aide and White House Director of Presidential Personnel as the Ambassador to India. If confirmed by the Senate, Gor will concurrently hold charge as Special Envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs. The region includes Pakistan and Bangladesh, among other countries, where Washington does not have ambassadors and US embassies are led by charge d'affaires.""For the most populous Region in the World, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my Agenda and help us, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador,"" Trump said in a social media post, describing Gor as ""a great friend, who has been at my side for many years.""Gor, who is 39, will be the youngest US ambassador to India, and will come to New Delhi replacing Eric Garcetti, a Democratic appointee who returned to his native California at the end of the Biden presidency.Gor is known as a low-profile White House insider who, by Trump's own account, hired nearly 4,000 ""America First Patriots"" (MAGA faithful) across every department of the federal government in record time.""He worked on my Historic Presidential Campaigns, published my Best Selling Books, and ran one of the biggest Super PACs, which supported our Movement. Sergio’s role as Director of Presidential Personnel has been essential to delivering on the unprecedented Mandate that we received from the American People,"" Trump said in introducing his putative envoy to a country that he appears to have soured on.Gor, whose original last name was Gorokhovsky, has no known previous ties or connections or work or scholarship relating to India. Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, when it was part of the former USSR, he emigrated to the US with his parents in 1999 when he was around 12. His father, Yuri Gorokhovsky is reported to be an aviation engineer who worked on aircraft designs for the Soviet military, notably the IL-76, a midair refueling supertanker that is part of the IAF fleet (which also had the comparable US-made C-17). His mother is said to be of Israeli origin.The Gors moved to the Los Angeles area, where he attended school before moving to the nation's capital to attend George Washington University, a few blocks from the White House. Active in young conservative, Republican circles, he served as a spokesman for lawmakers Steve King and Michele Bachman, both know for controversial far-right views, before joining Senator Rand Paul as a staffer and rising to Deputy Chief of Staff. He came into the Trump orbit during the 2020 elections and rose rapidly in MAGA movement, eventually living close to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate before moving to Washington DC when Trump named him Director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, following his November 2024 victory.","Sergio Gor is a close aide and White House Director of Presidential Personnel.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt General Jeffrey Kruse as head of the US defense intelligence agency (DIA), following President Donald Trump’s dissatisfaction with the agency’s preliminary assessment of US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, according to AP and other media reports.Kruse’s firing, first reported by The Washington Post, comes weeks after the agency’s initial intelligence estimate - which suggested Iran’s nuclear program had only been delayed by a few months - was leaked to the media. This contradicted President Trump’s public claim that the Iranian programme had been “completely and fully obliterated.”“You want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated - choose your word. This was an historically successful attack,” Hegseth said in a June press conference, defending the operation but without providing evidence.According to officials familiar with the matter, the decision was not publicly explained and comes amid a broader shake-up in the US military and intelligence leadership. Trump has previously removed officials whose reports or data contradict his public stance, including those in charge of jobs data and public health information.Kruse’s dismissal follows other senior-level exits, including air force general CQ Brown Jr, general Tim Haugh (NSA chief), and several senior legal officials across military branches. The office of the director of national intelligence has also announced staff and budget cuts this week.Pentagon officials have not released a formal statement on the rationale behind Kruse’s removal.

No client list but Epstein might not have committed suicide







In a major curtain-down moment for the ongoing Epstein case, the Justice Department released the full transcripts of the audio of Ghislaine Maxwell 's interview in which Maxwell said Epstein never had any client list ever and President Donald Trump did not do anything inappropriate with anybody when he was friends with pedophile Epstein.Maxwell is the only key person in the Epstein case and Maxwell was the disgraced financer's aide, girlfriend and was a party in many cases of sexual exploitation. After the DOJ and the FBI closed the Epstein case and said there was no foul play in Epstein's death, Maxwell who is serving her sentence claimed that her side of the story was never heard.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sat down with Maxwell in a federal prison in Tallahassee, where she was being held until recently. The terms of the interview granted her limited immunity from further prosecution – unless she told lies.Authorities published hundreds of pages of transcripts as well as audio recordings of the interview on the DOJ website.Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019. Conspiracy theorists love to believe that he was murdered in his cell because he was blackmailing people that he would disclose their names and their association with his child sex racket. With his death, the two issues remained mysteries: how he died and who are named on Epstein's list. After DOJ and FBI, Maxwell also claimed that Epstein did not maintain a client list. But Maxwell reiterated her past statements that she does not believe Epstein killed himself. She also said Epstein told her he had a heart condition that prevented him from having normal sexual intercourse.","Ghislaine Maxwell was the disgraced financer's aide, girlfriend and was a party in many cases of sexual exploitation.

A US-based Punjabi man said his community should not be vilified for the Florida truck accident.





A Punjabi man's take on the Florida accident in which three people were killed because of a wrong U-turn taken by an Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh went viral. In his video, Gurlove Preet Pabla, the Punjabi man, said people are not talking about the victims of the tragic accident and are only talking about the driver, who is at fault here.""They talked more about the turban, they talked more about the immigrant community. It was like one person's mistake defined millions of immigrants in the US. And I know there should be better training, there should be better hiring procedures when they hire these drivers. But the hypocrisy is when a white truck driver caused a crash in Colorado and killed four people, when a similar accident happened in Texas and it killed a whole family, nobody talked about the accent, nobody talked about the white skin, nobody talked about the baseball cap; nobody blamed all the white CDL drivers,"" Gurpreet said.""When it's a man with a turban, all of a sudden the turban is on trial. The whole immigrant community is on trial. And let's not forget there's another video circulating which isn't that much viral because it's a good video, right? The hate spreads more than humanity.

The move drew criticism from local officials, who said the action was politically motivated and raised concerns over federal overreach into local law enforcement matters.The deployment in DC was part of what Trump has framed as a broader ""law-and-order"" agenda heading into the 2026 midterm campaign cycle.Officials in the administration argue that federal intervention is necessary in cities struggling to contain violent crime, especially where local leadership is perceived as ineffective.Critics say such moves risk further politicising urban policing and federal law enforcement deployment, while supporters argue they are needed to ensure public safety in key metropolitan areas.","US President Donald Trump said Chicago and New York would be the next major American cities to see intensified federal action against crime.

ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot ‘sold out’ by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.
