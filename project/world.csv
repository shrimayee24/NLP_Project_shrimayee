'Insult To India': Political Uproar Over Trump's Credit to PM Modi, Pak Army Chief For Ceasefire

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7.

Israel-Iran war: Trump weighs US strike; Netanyahu cites 'personal cost',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-war-trump-weighs-us-strike-netanyahu-cites-personal-cost-10-key-points/articleshow/121964961.cms,"Here are 10 key developments:

US-Israel alignment under scrutiny

Regional conflict still looms large





A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.In the midst of this turmoil, President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.”He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.Although Trump and Netanyahu share strategic goals, including deterring Iran’s nuclear development, they appear to diverge tactically. Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Ayatollah Khamenei and has been cautious about direct involvement. However, Netanyahu has said he trusts Trump “to do what’s best for America” and credited Washington for already offering substantial support. The current phase of the conflict may test U.S. -Israeli coordination like never before, especially if diplomacy fails.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

Woman deboarded after alert from flight captain





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old doctor was arrested on Tuesday after she created ruckus aboard an Air India flight from Bengaluru to Surat and allegedly threatened to crash the aircraft when cabin crew objected to her placing baggage in a restricted area near the crew cabin.The incident delayed the flight by two hours and led to a security scare. The accused, identified as Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, from Shivanahalli near Yelahanka, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.Also read: Air India cuts frequencies across North America, UK, EU, Far East & Australia 'at least' till July 15 According to police, the Ayurvedic doctor bypassed the check-in counter, insisting on carrying both bags on board. The situation escalated after Mohanbhai boarded the flight and left one of her bags near the crew cabin while taking the other to her seat, 20F.When the cabin crew asked her to keep the bag in the overhead compartment near her seat, she refused and insisted they keep it with them. Despite repeated requests by the crew and later the captain, Mohanbhai refused to comply and began abusing the staff.The confrontation soon involved fellow passengers, who also tried to reason with her, but she reportedly shouted at them. At one point, she allegedly threatened to crash the flight if the crew moved her baggage.With the situation spiralling, the captain alerted security and called CISF personnel, who boarded the aircraft and offloaded her.The incident took place between 2.45pm and 5.30pm, according to a complaint filed by Agnimitra Bahinipati, associate manager of security at KIA. Police said Mohanbhai did not stop there. Once taken to KIA police station, she continued to abuse and manhandle police officers, creating further disturbance. “This was the first time we heard such abusive language in the station,” a senior officer claimed.Her husband, who works in an educational institution in the city and hails from Odisha, appeared before police. He informed them that Mohanbhai had stopped practising medicine and was en route to Gujarat to visit her family.He reportedly told police she had created disturbances in public spaces in the past. Police are now verifying her background and previous incidents.","Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, 36, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.

'Not asking for US green light': Netanyahu says Israel will hit all nuclear sites in Iran; quiet on eliminating Khamenei,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/not-asking-for-us-green-light-netanyahu-says-israel-will-hit-all-nuclear-sites-in-iran-eliminating-khamenei/articleshow/121964429.cms,"



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel will not wait for a US green light to continue its military campaign against Iran and is fully committed to hitting all Iranian nuclear sites — including the heavily fortified Fordo facility.""We will achieve all our objectives and hit all of their nuclear facilities. We have the capability to do that,"" Netanyahu declared in a rare Hebrew-language interview with the Kan public broadcaster, underscoring Israel’s determination to act decisively and independently.The comment came hours after US President Donald Trump said he will decide whether to join Israel's strikes on Iran within the next two weeks as there is still a ""substantial"" chance of talks to end the conflict. ""Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,"" Trump had said in a statement.Netanyahu emphasised that Israel is proceeding with its campaign regardless of whether the United States decides to join the offensive. “Whether US President Donald Trump wants to join or not — that’s entirely his decision,” he said.“He’ll do what’s good for the United States, and I’ll do what’s good for the State of Israel.” The prime minister stressed that Israel is not asking for permission or a “green light” from any foreign power.“Either way, we’re going to do this, because we have no choice. We will not allow 3,500 years of Jewish history to come to an end because of this deranged ayatollah,” Netanyahu declared, referencing Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Netanyahu outlined Israel’s comprehensive strategy to neutralise Iran’s nuclear threat by targeting every nuclear facility, including the underground Fordo site, which is widely considered one of the most secure and difficult to strike.“We have the capability to do that,” he said confidently, signaling Israel’s readiness to deploy advanced military assets to destroy even the most heavily fortified targets.The prime minister reported that Israel is “ahead of schedule” in its campaign, having already destroyed at least half of Iran’s missile launchers and eliminated key military leaders. He highlighted ongoing strikes against paramilitary forces such as the Basij militia, which plays a critical role in suppressing dissent within Iran. Netanyahu also noted that Israel has inflicted “heavy damage” on the regime’s internal security apparatus and will continue to target symbols of the Iranian government.While Israel is prepared to act independently, Netanyahu acknowledged the importance of US support.He revealed that he speaks with President Trump almost daily and described their conversations as “very good.”However, he declined to disclose details, saying, “Let’s not call on the historical archive to release itself just yet.”Netanyahu praised Trump’s recognition of Israel’s right to self-defense, contrasting it with former President Joe Biden’s attempts to restrict Israeli operations against Iranian proxies.On the question of regime change, Netanyahu reiterated that it is ultimately up to the Iranian people.“The issue of regime change or the downfall of this administration primarily concerns the Iranian populace,” he said.Nonetheless, he emphasized that Israel is striking government targets and symbols of the regime and that “there’s more to come.” Netanyahu described Iran’s Supreme Leader as a “deranged ayatollah” threatening the future of the Jewish people and stressed that Israel will do “everything necessary” to neutralize the existential threat posed by Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Asked whether Khamenei is a dead man walking, he replied: ""I gave instructions that no one is immune. I prefer not to deal with [making] headlines and to let actions speak for themselves.""“During a war words have to be chosen with care, and actions with precision,"" he said adding that he expects this “from my ministers as well"", an implied criticism of defense minister Israel Katz, who has been publicly threatening Khamenei.",Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will not wait for a US green light to continue its military campaign against Iran.

Air supremacy tactics: With Israel having temporarily gained air dominance over large swathes of Iran, it could loiter over Fordow and disrupt activities, although this wouldn't eliminate the facility.

Would the US step in?



Why the stakes are so high







As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, a chilling question arises: Could this spiral into a nuclear crisis? In the past five days, the situation has worsened, with Israel reportedly targeting nuclear sites in Tehran. Experts warn that any further escalation could be catastrophic. At the heart of these rising tensions lies Iran’s most secretive and fortified nuclear facility, Fordow.Tucked deep beneath a mountain near Qom, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is one of Iran’s most secretive and heavily fortified nuclear sites. Its underground design—80 to 90 meters below the surface—makes it virtually impenetrable to aerial strikes, even with the most advanced bunker-buster bombs in Israel’s arsenal. Originally exposed in 2009 through Western intelligence, Fordow was built in secrecy and designed for survivability, especially in the face of potential military attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.What makes Fordow particularly alarming to global powers is its capacity to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade. According to the IAEA, the site now houses 2,700 centrifuges and has been enriching uranium to 60%—a short technical step away from the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), uranium enriched to 83.7% purity was found at the site in 2023, dangerously close to the 90% enrichment level needed for nuclear weapons.Experts warn that Iran could produce enough material for multiple bombs in just weeks if it chooses to weaponize its stockpile. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility, raising the stakes of any military or diplomatic attempt to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster—that might reach its buried core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes. For Iran, Fordow is a nuclear insurance policy. For the world, it is a red line—and possibly a countdown.""The Iranians fully understood that the Israelis would try to get inside their programs, and they built Fordo inside of a mountain a long time ago to take care of the post-Iraq problem,"" said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.Only one known weapon could potentially take out Fordow: the US-made 30,000-pound bomb. This bomb, also called ""bunker buster,"" is capable of burrowing through rock and steel before detonating.But there's a catch: Israel doesn't have it. The United States has consistently denied Israeli requests for the bomb, citing fears that its use could provoke a full-scale regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said general Joseph Votel, former head of US central command.While Israel lacks the bunker buster or a heavy bomber to deliver it, it hasn't given up on options:""The Israelis have sprung a lot of clandestine operations lately,"" said general Kenneth McKenzie Jr, former commander of US central command. ""But the physics of the problem remain the same.""While the US has moved aircraft and refuelling tankers into the region, there's no indication yet that US President Donald Trump is prepared to shift long-standing US policy and provide Israel with the bomb. Officials warn that deploying it would involve complex coordination and risk significant collateral and geopolitical fallout.""If we use the bunker buster, there could be nuclear contamination,"" general Votel said. ""I think there would also certainly be fallout internationally over the idea that the United States joined Israel in what would be viewed as an illegal attack on the sovereignty of Iran,"" he added.Fordow is not just a physical challenge—it is a political one. An Israeli strike on the site, especially with US involvement, could trigger Iranian retaliation against American assets across the Middle East and plunge the region into another war.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But with enrichment levels rising and regional threats mounting, international anxiety over Fordow continues to grow.Fordow symbolises the nuclear stalemate between Iran and its adversaries. For Israel, it represents the limits of its conventional reach. For the US, it is a geopolitical tripwire. And for Iran, it remains a testament to strategic foresight in the face of existential threats. As the Middle East teeters on the edge of a broader conflict, what happens—or does n't—at Fordow could shape the course of history.","Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster that might reach the core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121909319,imgsize-1036760,width-400,resizemode-4/121909319.jpg"

Huge FIREBALL As Iranian Missile Dodges Iron Dome, Explodes In Between Tel Aviv Skyscrapers

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile, marking one of the most direct attacks on Israel's economic infrastructure since hostilities erupted.The strike was part of a wider Iranian missile barrage that targeted multiple locations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva, as per Al Jazeera and local media reports.The attack marks a significant escalation on the seventh day of direct conflict between the two long-time rivals.“This morning, Iran's terrorist dictators fired missiles at Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and at civilians in the centre of the country,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X. “We will make the tyrants in Tehran pay a heavy price,” he added, condemning the strikes on civilian infrastructure, including the hospital and the stock exchange.According to Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service, at least 47 people were injured during the attacks, with 18 more hurt while rushing to bomb shelters.Soroka Hospital in Be’er Sheva suffered a direct hit. The hospital director confirmed “several wards were completely demolished and there is extensive damage across the medical centre,” reported AFP.Iran, on its part, said its missiles were aimed at Israeli military and intelligence installations. Iranian state media reported the operation was part of “True Promise 3,” launched in retaliation for Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion”—a series of strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets that began on June 13. On Thursday, Israel responded by targeting Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor. Iranian state television said the facility had been evacuated and that “there is no radiation danger whatsoever. ”The strikes on Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva came as tensions reached a boiling point following Israel’s repeated attacks on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, including recent airstrikes on over 20 military and nuclear sites across Tehran, Natanz, and Arak.According to CNN, the Israeli Air Force deployed 60 fighter jets to strike centrifuge production and R&D sites linked to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.The missile that hit the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange comes as both countries continue to exchange daily barrages. An Israeli military official, quoted by AFP, said that since the conflict began, Iran has launched around 400 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones. Of these, around 20 missiles have landed in civilian areas of Israel, the official said.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has hinted at possible intervention but stopped short of confirming any military action. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he told reporters. “I like to make the final decision one second before it’s due, because things change. Especially with war.”Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has dismissed US demands, saying: “This nation will never surrender,” and warned of “irreparable damage” if the US intervenes.Both nations continue to count mounting casualties. As of the last official update, at least 24 Israelis had been killed and hundreds wounded, according to Netanyahu’s office. Iran said over 220 people, including military commanders and civilians, had died from Israeli strikes, though neither side has released updated figures since.","The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile.

Who is 'Jeff' and why does 'he' have 10 nuclear weapons?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jeff-and-why-does-he-have-10-nuclear-weapons/articleshow/121951166.cms,"So who is Jeff?

Iran's Nuclear Ambitions





While President Donald J. Trump was issuing fresh warnings from the White House — “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It’s very simple.” — a more peculiar nuclear mystery was unfolding online. This one wasn’t about centrifuges spinning in Fordo or uranium stockpiles in Natanz. It was about Jeff.Specifically, a bar chart from CNN titled “World’s Nuclear Arsenals” listed the usual powers: Russia, the United States, France, China, the UK, and so on. But tucked away near the bottom, with fewer than 10 warheads, was an unexpected entrant: Jeff. No flag. No footnote. Just the name — as if he were a rogue microstate with a doomsday arsenal.So who is Jeff? To the casual viewer, Jeff might sound like a rogue nuclear actor. A breakaway republic? A tech billionaire with a uranium hobby? A bulky think tank guy?The answer is disappointingly rational. JEFF stands for the Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion File, a nuclear data library maintained by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). It is not a country and does not possess weapons. It compiles nuclear reaction data for civilian applications — including power generation, reactor safety, and medical isotopes.The latest dataset, JEFF-3.3, released in 2017, is widely used across Europe.What likely happened is a labelling error: a dataset meant to be cited as the source of nuclear information was mistakenly interpreted as an entity with nuclear weapons. This misrepresentation, noted in a 2024 IFLScience article, shows how easily public understanding of complex topics can be distorted — especially when visualised without context.While social media turned Jeff into a fictional arms dealer, the real nuclear issue — Iran — continues to escalate. Trump’s administration, now back in office, has repeatedly stated that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is non-negotiable.Iran’s nuclear programme began under the Shah in the 1950s, with US support through President Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace initiative. The Tehran Research Reactor was built with American assistance. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the programme was briefly suspended but revived in the 1980s with help from Pakistan, Russia, and China — this time without Western oversight.By the early 2000s, Iran’s nuclear activities drew intense scrutiny. In 2002, dissident groups revealed secret enrichment facilities at Natanz and Arak, prompting IAEA investigations. Iran maintained that its goals were peaceful — energy independence and medical research — but limited inspector access and evidence of weaponisation work raised alarms.This led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to restrict uranium enrichment and submit to international inspections in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, Trump withdrew from the deal, citing weak enforcement and sunset clauses.Since then, Iran has significantly expanded its enrichment activities. As of 2025, it is enriching uranium to 60% purity — just shy of weapons-grade — and is believed to have enough material for a bomb within weeks, if it chooses to proceed, according to IAEA assessments.Trump has responded with blunt consistency: “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Not as a slogan, but as a foreign policy red line.","A bar chart from CNN titled ‘World’s Nuclear Arsenals’ listed the usual powers: Russia, the United States, France, China, the UK, and so on. tucked away near the bottom, with fewer than 10 warheads, was an unexpected entrant: Jeff.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama said she is glad that she did not have a son who would inevitably become like Barack Obama . “You should’ve threw a boy in the mix,” radio host Angie Martinez told Obama in an episode of the former first lady’s “IMO” podcast released Wednesday.

It has now been neutralized. Here is a closer look at the reactor itself,"" it said sharing the video.Israel struck Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor, according to Iranian state TV, which reported the site had been evacuated in advance and posed no radiation risk.The Arak reactor, located about 250 km southwest of Tehran, uses heavy water, which can be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.The attack came in retaliation to Iran's strike at a hospital in southern Israel which left nearly 40 injured.While most attention on Iran’s nuclear program centers on uranium enrichment, experts closely monitor the Arak heavy water reactor due to its potential to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.When Israel attacked the site, the reactor was offline with no uranium fuel, and no radiation was released. The IAEA has warned that nuclear sites should never be targeted in conflict.The Arak heavy water reactor was part of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal, which required it to be redesigned to reduce proliferation risks, including pouring concrete into part of the facility. However, the redesign was never fully completed.After the US withdrew from the deal in 2018, Iranian officials claimed they had replaced the concrete-filled parts with new components. Due to limited access, the IAEA has since lost “continuity of knowledge” about Iran’s heavy water production and cannot fully verify its stockpile or activities.","Israel Defence Forces shared video of the nuclear reactor in Arak claiming that it was being used by Iran to create nuclear bomb.

Leaked call crisis: Thailand PM Paetongtarn battles to save government; to meet army commander aiming for a solution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/leaked-call-crisis-thailand-pm-paetongtarn-battles-to-save-government-to-meet-army-commander-aiming-for-a-solution/articleshow/121965773.cms,"File photo: Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra (center), talking to reporters at Government house in Bangkok (Picture credit: AP)





Thailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra will visit a senior army commander on Friday in a bid to contain a political crisis that has brought her government to the brink of collapse.The fallout stems from a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen in which she referred to the military commander as her “opponent,” sparking outrage among nationalist and pro-military quarters.The leaked recording, posted online by Hun Sen himself, has plunged Paetongtarn’s fragile coalition into turmoil.Her key ally, the conservative Bhumjaithai party, announced its exit from the ruling bloc on Wednesday, accusing her of disrespecting Thailand’s military and compromising national sovereignty. The move left her Pheu Thai-led coalition with a razor-thin majority in the 500-seat parliament.The 17-minute phone call was made during discussions over a recent deadly border clash in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. Paetongtarn addressed Hun Sen as “uncle” during the conversation, a common form of respect in Thai culture but interpreted by critics as overly deferential.More damaging was her reference to Lieutenant General Boonsin Padklang, commander of forces in northeastern Thailand, as an adversary.On Friday, she is expected to meet Boonsin in person in Thailand’s northeast to make amends.Her government has also filed a formal protest with Cambodia, labelling the leak “a breach of diplomatic etiquette,” as per news agency AFP.Facing mounting pressure, Paetongtarn issued a public apology on Thursday, standing alongside army and police chiefs in a display of unity.She explained that her comments were part of a negotiation strategy aimed at easing border tensions and said she would not engage in private discussions with Hun Sen again. “It’s now clear that all that he cares about is his popularity… without considering impacts on relations with other countries,” she said, according to news agency AP.Despite the political storm, there was a glimmer of support for Paetongtarn. The Democrat Party, another conservative coalition partner, announced it would remain in the government “to help resolve the challenges the country is currently facing”.Chartthaipattana also confirmed it would stay, following urgent coalition talks.Still, the situation remains precarious. Opposition leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut has called for Paetongtarn to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections, stating the leak had destroyed public confidence in her leadership.Nationalist groups staged protests in Bangkok on Thursday demanding her resignation.The crisis has revived fears of another military coup, especially given the Shinawatra family’s turbulent history with the army. Her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted in 2006, and her aunt Yingluck met the same fate in 2014.Thaksin, who remains influential, is widely believed to be pulling strings behind the scenes, fuelling unease among Thailand’s conservative elites.With the government’s future uncertain and the threat of US trade tariffs looming, the political turbulence comes at a critical time for the Thai economy. If more coalition partners defect, Paetongtarn may be forced to call early elections or step aside to allow a new coalition to form, moves that would plunge Thailand into fresh political uncertainty.","Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra will visit a senior army commander on Friday in a bid to contain a political crisis.

'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran; sparks backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/sons-wedding-cancelled-for-second-time-netanyahu-shares-personal-cost-of-war-with-iran-sparks-backlash/articleshow/121965691.cms,"



Standing before the shattered facade of Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a sombre message invoking the spirit of wartime London during the Blitz. But rather than rally national unity, his comments – referencing his son Avner’s postponed wedding – sparked widespread backlash online and among his critics.“It really reminds me of the British people during the Blitz. We are going through a blitz,” Netanyahu said, seeking to draw a parallel between the Nazi bombing of Britain and the ongoing Israeli-Iranian conflict. He then spoke of the “personal cost” his family has borne, saying Avner’s wedding had been postponed for the second time due to missile threats.“This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancee as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost,” he said.Critics seized on his remarks as tone-deaf, accusing the prime minister of being emotionally detached from the war’s daily toll, which has left 24 Israeli civilians dead and many more wounded. Iran’s death toll is far higher, with a Washington-based rights group reporting at least 657 killed, including 263 civilians, and over 2,000 injured.The war began with a wave of surprise Israeli airstrikes on June 13 targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, key military personnel, and infrastructure. In retaliation, Iran launched over 450 missiles and 1,000 drones, striking multiple Israeli cities.A missile hit Soroka hospital on Thursday morning, injuring around 80 people and damaging critical infrastructure. While Iran claimed the intended target was a nearby Israeli military tech unit, Israeli officials said there was no intelligence suggesting the hospital was deliberately hit.Netanyahu, speaking amidst the rubble, also praised President Trump’s ongoing support. “I can tell you that they’re already helping a lot,” he said, expressing trust in the US to “do what's best for America.”The White House confirmed that Trump would make a decision on possible direct action against Iran within two weeks. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said ongoing negotiations with Tehran include demands for a complete halt to uranium enrichment and the dismantling of its nuclear programme.Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes have reportedly reached deep into Iran, including targets in Rasht and Isfahan. Iran’s defensive capabilities were visibly strained, and with Hezbollah weakened and Syria’s former president Assad ousted in late 2024, Tehran appears increasingly isolated. Iran has also threatened to disrupt global trade through the Strait of Hormuz, warning of economic repercussions if the war continues.","Netanyahu spoke of the ‘personal cost’ his family has borne.

Chinese state-affiliated groups have been reportedly hacking Russian government agencies and companies since the Ukraine war began, seeking military intelligence, according to cybersecurity analysts.According to NYT report, The cyber campaign intensified in May 2022, shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin touted an unprecedented era of cooperation between their nations.Also read: ‘China is the enemy’: Leaked Russian intelligence reveals Kremlin's actual view of Beijing In one notable incident in 2023, a Chinese group called Sanyo masqueraded as representatives of a major Russian engineering firm to gather intelligence about nuclear submarines, according to findings by TeamT5, a Taiwanese cybersecurity research firm.While China's military and technological capabilities surpass Russia's, Chinese military strategists have long noted their forces' lack of actual combat experience. The Ukraine conflict presents Beijing with an opportunity to study modern warfare tactics and Western military equipment's effectiveness, experts say.A classified FSB (Russia's domestic security agency) counterintelligence document obtained by The New York Times reveals Moscow's growing concerns about Chinese espionage.The document explicitly labels China an ""enemy"" and acknowledges Beijing's efforts to acquire Russian defence technology and learn from its military operations in Ukraine.The relationship appears more complex than the publicly proclaimed ""no-limits"" partnership. While Russia has become increasingly dependent on China for oil exports and war-critical technology amid Western sanctions, the extent of Chinese cyber operations suggests significant mutual distrust.Though allies, both are occasionally known to engage in espionage against each other, the scale of China's cyber campaign against Russia indicates both deeper suspicion between the powers and Moscow's reluctance to fully share its battlefield insights from Ukraine.","Chinese state-affiliated groups have been reportedly hacking Russian government agencies and companies since the Ukraine war began.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

‘Nuclear Sites Bombed’: ALARMING Escalation In Iran, Israel Clash After Mega Missile Mayhem

Israel issued a stark warning to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that he ""cannot continue to exist"" adding that the Israel Defence Forces had been instructed to ensure the same. This came after Iran, in its retaliatory strikes, attacked a hospital in Israel leaving nearly 40 injured on Thursday.“A dictator like Khamenei, who heads a country like Iran and has made the destruction of Israel his mission, cannot continue to exist,” Israeli defence minister Katz said. “The IDF has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist,” he added.US President Donald Trump had earlier made it clear that the US had no plans to kill Khamenei, ""at least not for now"".""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding.

Noem curbs ICE access: DHS rules limit lawmakers' visits; Democrats accuse Trump of hiding abuses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/noem-curbs-ice-access-dhs-rules-limit-lawmakers-visits-democrats-accuse-trump-of-hiding-abuses/articleshow/121964164.cms,"AP file photo





The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued new rules limiting how and when members of Congress can visit immigration detention centres. This comes after several tense visits by Democratic lawmakers.Under federal law, lawmakers can make unannounced visits to ICE facilities. But the new DHS policy requires them to give prior notice. It also limits the number of people per visit and says lawmakers must name specific detainees in advance and get signed privacy forms.“ICE will not facilitate meetings with detainees in detention facilities without valid, signed privacy releases. If Members and/or Congressional staff would like to meet with a specific detainee or set of detainees, please provide names, alien registration numbers, and valid, signed privacy releases with your request,” DHS stated.Tensions have been rising. In New Jersey, three Democratic lawmakers tried to visit Delaney Hall with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. A scuffle broke out, and Baraka was arrested for trespassing. Charges were later dropped, but Rep. LaMonica McIver now faces charges of assaulting an officer during the clash. If convicted, she could face up to 17 years in prison.Senator Alex Padilla was also briefly handcuffed during a protest in Los Angeles where Noem was speaking.The Trump administration says the new rules are to protect privacy, but Democrats say it’s an attempt to hide the impact of harsh immigration policies.Rep. Jerry Nadler pushed back strongly against the new DHS restrictions, saying the Trump administration has no legal authority to block lawmakers from inspecting detention sites. He cited Section 527 of the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which allows members of Congress to inspect DHS-operated facilities without prior notice.Nadler in a post on X, said he had informed ICE in advance anyway, but the agency is now wrongly claiming that its field offices are exempt — even though migrants are being held there overnight, sometimes sleeping on the floor. “It doesn’t matter what ICE chooses to call a facility,” he said. “If it’s used for detention, Congress has the right to inspect it. Period.”","The US Department of Homeland Security has issued new rules limiting how and when members of Congress can visit immigration detention centres.

An Iranian ballistic missile struck the southern Israeli city of Beersheba on Friday, causing extensive damage near residential areas but no reported casualties. The missile hit just outside apartment blocks, igniting several vehicles and damaging nearby homes. Firefighters were deployed to control blazes at the scene.Sirens were activated across Beersheba and surrounding towns following the launch. The Israeli military confirmed that “sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles launched from Iran toward the State of Israel,” and said interception efforts were underway.This strike comes a day after Iranian missiles hit a major hospital in southern Israel and residential buildings in Tel Aviv, wounding 240 people. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz blamed Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating, “the military has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Israel has since responded by targeting Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor, part of its nuclear infrastructure. Iranian state television said the facility had been evacuated in time, and “no radiation danger whatsoever” was reported.As the situation escalates, diplomatic efforts continue. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said after meeting US officials that the Middle East “remains perilous,” and that a two-week window exists to avoid deepening conflict. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is due to meet European diplomats in Geneva.Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes have reached deep into Iran, including the city of Rasht, while Iran remains under a near-total internet blackout.","Iranian ballistic missile strikes southern Israeli city of Beersheba.

Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, Chief of Staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), told Israel's intelligence officers on Thursday that the country had turned Iran’s “ring of fire” against them — a reference to alleged years of Iranian preparation for attacks on Israel.""We are now turning the 'ring of fire' -- the sword that they built for years to attack us -- against them on their territory,"" Zamir told troops in the Intelligence Directorate.He went on to praised their efforts and described the current operations as transformative. “What we are doing here is historic — we are changing the face of the Middle East,” he said, adding that their success was being closely watched around the world.Zamir credited the team with “extraordinary capabilities,” calling them the people behind making the campaign possible.""Every citizen of this country, and the whole world, is looking at you with admiration and respect. Everyone wants to learn how this happened, and I'm telling you, there are miracles, and those that make them happen are people, and in this case, those people are you.""The statement followed his visit to the IDF’s Targeting Center, where officials said major operations had recently been carried out against Iranian positions, reported Jerusalem Post.Meanwhile, Major General Shlomi Binder said that the IDF struck Iran’s elite Quds Force heavily on the first night of operations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday signaled openness to international support, including from the United States, in efforts to dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, nearly a week into Israel's sweeping aerial assault on the Islamic republic.In an interview with Israel's public broadcaster Kan, Netanyahu declared that Israel is “capable of striking all of Iran's nuclear facilities”, but added: “All help is welcome.”The comments come amid escalating regional tensions, as Israeli fighter jets continue pounding nuclear and military targets deep inside Iranian territory. The campaign was launched last Friday in response to what Israel called a “grave and immediate threat” from Tehran.When asked about the role of Washington, Netanyahu said he expected President Donald Trump to act in the interests of the US.“President Trump will do what is good for the United States, and I will do what is good for the State of Israel,” Netanyahu said.The remarks are being interpreted as both a declaration of military self-reliance and an invitation for American involvement, as Israel pushes deeper into Iranian territory with high-stakes strikes on key sites, including the Arak heavy water reactor earlier this week.While the US has thus far stopped short of joining the military offensive, senior American officials have reiterated Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to Israeli security. Meanwhile, Iran has warned that any further escalation, especially involving US forces, would trigger “unimaginable consequences.”Israel’s offensive has drawn mixed reactions globally, with some allies urging restraint while others back Israel’s right to self-defense.","Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is ""capable of striking all of Iran's nuclear facilities"" Comments come amid escalating regional tensions, as Israeli fighter jets continue pounding nuclear and military targets deep inside Iranian territory.

'Stay Out!': Putin Aide Hints At Russia Joining Iran-Israel War If Trump Bombs Tehran's Nukes

'If You Join War...': Putin's EXPLOSIVE IRAN WARNING To Trump If He Bombards Nuke Sites

Mediator in the Middle East



Chaos pays







Just a decade ago, the world watched as Russia made a bold and high-stakes intervention in Syria. In 2015, when Bashar al-Assad’s regime stood on the brink of collapse, Russian fighter jets streaked across Syrian skies. That intervention not only saved Assad, at least temporarily, but also projected Moscow’s re-emergence as a power with teeth in the Middle East. Fast forward to 2025, and the scene today looks very different.Iran, one of Russia’s closest regional allies, is now under sustained attack from Israel. Over the past several days, Israeli strikes have hit Iranian missile facilities and suspected nuclear sites. And yet, the Kremlin’s response has been muted, even passive.While Moscow has issued the usual statements of concern and condemnation, it has shown no inclination to get involved militarily. This marks a sharp departure from the Syria playbook and reflects a significant recalibration of Russia’s Middle East policy.At the heart of Russia’s caution is its war in Ukraine. The ongoing conflict, Europe's biggest since World War II, is now in its third year, and has consumed much of Russia’s military capacity.Nikita Smagin, an expert on Russia-Iran relations, summed it up clearly: ""Russia, when it comes to Iran, must weigh the possibility of a clash with Israel and the United States, so saving Iran is obviously not worth it,"" Smagin was quoted as saying by the. In other words, the Kremlin has neither the resources nor the appetite for another major military adventure, especially one that risks confrontation with two formidable powers.Russia is also treading carefully because of its relationships with the Gulf monarchies—countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. These states, while wary of Israeli escalation, are deeply uncomfortable with a stronger Iran.Russia has worked hard to develop economic and energy partnerships with the Gulf, and intervening on Iran’s behalf could jeopardize those ties.There is also the recent memory of Syria itself. Although Russia initially managed to keep Assad in power through its intervention, the regime ultimately collapsed in December 2024. The collapse of Assad's regimemarked a painful and costly failure for the Kremlin. Years of military investment, political capital, and international pushback ended in defeat. Half a year later, Moscow is still picking up the pieces—and that experience weighs heavily on how it views the Iranian situation today.There’s no doubt that the collapse of Iran’s regime—which now appears to be an Israeli objective—would represent another major loss for Russia’s network of alliances in the region. It would join Iraq, Libya, and Syria on the growing list of countries where Moscow has seen its influence unravel. And yet, the Kremlin does not appear panicked. In fact, the current conflict may be playing into its hands in a different way.Unlike during the Syria crisis, where Russia had to use force to assert its presence, this time it is leveraging its position as a potential mediator. Vladimir Putin is currently the only major global leader with open lines to all three key players in this crisis: Iran, Israel, and the United States. That fact alone gives Russia significant diplomatic leverage. A report by CNN highlighted how Putin is already using that leverage behind the scenes. ""In a recent call to the White House, Putin reminded President Donald Trump how Russia has been a long-time US ally when it comes to the Iranian nuclear issue – a heavy hint that he is open to being one again."" The White House, CNN added, appears receptive to this possibility.""If it comes to some form of behind-the-scenes diplomacy, Russia is more likely to play a role between Iran and the United States — Israel’s interest in negotiations is not apparent,"" Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, a think tank that advises the Kremlin, was quoted as saying in a report by the Bloomberg.Putin’s mediation efforts have already begun. The Russian president has reached out to both Iranian and Israeli leaders, offering to help de-escalate the situation. From Moscow’s perspective, being the indispensable broker is a way to exert influence while avoiding the risks that military intervention would entail.This broker role also aligns with Russia’s long-term economic interests. Tensions in the Middle East often lead to higher oil prices, something that benefits the Kremlin, which continues to rely heavily on energy exports to sustain its war in Ukraine.""While the oil price is high, Russia can get billions of dollars, potentially tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue, and this is always useful,"" Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst was quoted as saying by The Washington Post.By remaining diplomatically engaged but militarily uninvolved, Russia is preserving its influence in the region while quietly profiting from the instability.What we are seeing, then, is not a retreat by Russia, but a strategic pivot. In the past, influence in the Middle East meant projecting hard power—troops, jets, bases. Today, the Kremlin seems to believe it can do more with less. It is using the crisis not to save Iran in the traditional sense, but to reframe itself as the essential power for dialogue and de-escalation.Still, this approach carries risks. If Iran’s regime does fall, Russia will lose one of its few remaining allies in the region. Already, its footholds in Iraq, Libya, and Syria have receded, and Iran’s fall would deepen that trend. That could further isolate Moscow at a time when it is already under pressure from Western sanctions and a grinding war in Ukraine. But for now, the Kremlin appears to be betting that it can keep a foot in the door diplomatically, even as its military stays home.","Russia has shown no inclination to get involved militarily in the Iran-Israel conflict. This marks a sharp departure from the Syria playbook and reflects a significant recalibration of Russia’s Middle East policy.

RAMALLAH: Israeli troops raided two Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank's north overnight, the military told AFP, as Israel presses offensives on multiple fronts.The military told AFP that at ""around 4:00 am Israeli forces entered Balata camp"", near the northern city of Nablus, for ""a routine counter-terrorism operation"".It added that the troops had been deployed to the nearby Askar camp prior to the operation in Balata camp.Imad Zaki, head of the popular services committee of Balata camp, also told AFP that the military began its raid at 4:00 am (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.""They closed all entrances to the camp, seized several homes after evicting their residents, and ordered the homeowners not to return for 72 hours. These homes were turned into military outposts and interrogation centres,"" Zaki said.""The soldiers are conducting house-to-house and neighbourhood-to-neighbourhood searches, destroying the contents of homes and physically assaulting the residents,"" Zaki told AFP.He added that life had been ""largely paralysed"" for the camp's residents but that no injuries were reported.In a separate statement, the military said that its forces had ""neutralised"" one Palestinian overnight in the West Bank village of Al-Walaja near Jerusalem.They said that as the troops were deployed in the area, a Palestinian armed with a knife ""attempted to stab (Israeli) soldiers who were operating in the area and steal their weapons"".""The soldiers responded with fire and neutralised the terrorist,"" the army said, using a term it normally uses when someone has been killed.The Israeli military said Tuesday that its forces had been active in various parts of the Jenin area, in the northern West Bank.It said in a statement that its forces had arrested five Palestinian militants suspected of planning attacks on Israel.Throughout the Gaza war, violence in the West Bank -- a separate Palestinian territory -- has soared, as have calls to annex it, most notably from Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.Since the start of the war in October 2023, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 939 Palestinians, including many militants, according to the Palestinian health ministry.Over the same period, at least 35 Israelis including civilians and soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military raids, according to official Israeli figures.","Israeli troops raid two Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank's north overnight.

and possibly small cascade setups for testing. Train technicians and engineers for handling the enrichment process.





Why are these sites targeted?





The Iran-Israel conflict intensified on Wednesday as Israel launched a powerful wave of airstrikes, destroying key military infrastructure in and around Tehran including two centrifuge production facilities, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The strikes mark a serious escalation in the six-day-old confrontation, with fears now mounting of an impending regional war.“The IDF attacked a centrifuge production site and several weapons production siteU.Ss of the Iranian regime last night,” Israel’s military said in a statement, adding that more than 50 fighter jets were involved in the mission. “More than 50 Air Force fighter jets, under precise intelligence guidance from the Intelligence Branch, have completed a series of attacks on military targets in the Tehran area in recent hours. ”The Israeli Defence Forces said the targeted centrifuge site was intended to accelerate Iran’s uranium enrichment capability for nuclear weapons. “The Iranian regime is enriching uranium intended for the development of nuclear weapons,” the IDF stated, noting that Iran's enrichment levels far surpass civilian energy requirements.The IAEA reported that the destroyed sites were not active enrichment plants but manufacturing hubs — critical to Iran’s capacity to build more centrifuges and expand nuclear operations.Centrifuges, delicate and high-speed spinning devices, are central to enriching uranium — either for peaceful energy or, at higher levels, for nuclear weapons. Damaging these manufacturing facilities could seriously hamper Iran's future ability to scale up enrichment.Other targeted sites included factories producing components for surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, further underlining the breadth of Israel’s intent to dismantle Iran’s military-industrial complex.Despite the damage, Iran’s operational enrichment facilities remain partly functional. The Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, which had 13,500 centrifuges running out of 17,000 before the strike, has suffered significant power cuts. The Fordow site — located deep underground — remains largely intact and continues producing uranium enriched to 60%. According to the IAEA, Iran recently generated 166.6 kg of 60% enriched uranium — nearly enough for four nuclear bombs if refined further.While Iran has yet to disclose the full extent of Wednesday’s damage, residents in Tehran reported explosions that shook neighbourhoods and sent many fleeing in the dead of night. Human rights groups estimate that over 580 people have died in Iran since the conflict erupted, including civilians caught in the crossfire.US President Donald Trump, closely coordinating with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sharply escalated tensions with a provocative statement on social media. “He is an easy target, but is safe there—we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said, referring to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He called for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and dismissed its nuclear programme as anything but peaceful.Though the US has not yet entered the conflict militarily, it has repositioned assets in the region. Trump, who cut short his G7 summit visit to return to Washington, is under growing pressure from allies like Senator Lindsey Graham to deliver a decisive blow to Iran.Iran, meanwhile, remains defiant. “The punishment operation will be carried out soon,” said General Abdul Rahim Mousavi, the Iranian army chief, as another wave of missiles was launched toward Israel. Most were intercepted, but authorities in Israeli cities have kept air raid shelters open and continue urging citizens to remain on alert.The strikes mark one of the most serious escalations in years, not just between Iran and Israel, but for the wider region. Iran has warned that any direct US involvement could trigger an “all-out war.” As diplomacy falters and military action deepens, fears are growing that the next days could tip an already-volatile conflict into a far more dangerous phase.A centrifuge production site in a nuclear program is a specialised facility where the delicate and highly engineered components of gas centrifuges are designed, manufactured, assembled, and sometimes tested. These centrifuges are critical to uranium enrichment, a process essential for both civilian nuclear energy and, at high enrichment levels, for nuclear weapons.A gas centrifuge is a tall, cylindrical machine that spins uranium hexafluoride (UF₆) gas at very high speeds. Because uranium-235 (the fissile isotope used in nuclear reactors and bombs) is slightly lighter than uranium-238, the centrifugal force separates them — very gradually — allowing the concentration of U-235 to increase.Centrifuge production sites are the backbone of an enrichment programme. They:Destroying centrifuge production sites doesn’t immediately halt enrichment — but it cripples future expansion. Unlike enrichment facilities (like Natanz or Fordow), these production plants are where Iran (or any country) can build thousands of new centrifuges to scale up operations. Hitting these sites is seen as a long-term strategic setback for any clandestine or overt weapons programme.","Strikes hit deep into Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.

24x7 control room helpline numbers







NEW DELHI: Falguni Dey, a Kolkata-based geography professor and amateur mountaineer, thought the worst was over when he left the chaos of Tehran behind. After a harrowing 500-km road journey through a country rattled by missile strikes and fuel shortages, Dey reached the Astara border near the Caspian Sea, hoping to cross into Azerbaijan and board a flight from Baku to India.But what awaited him was another stretch of uncertainty -- marked by red tape, emotional exhaustion, and a prolonged wait for a migration code he never knew he needed.“I may have managed to escape the bombs in Tehran by undertaking this journey, but now I am stuck in Iran’s Astara land border because the Azerbaijan authorities would not accept me into their country without a special migration code issued by that government, and my e-visa won’t work,” Dey said in a voice message to PTI.The college professor had been stranded in Tehran since June 12, when Israel launched airstrikes on Iran as part of Operation Rising Lion, prompting the shutdown of airspace and halting his return journey. He had arrived in Iran on June 6 to attempt a summit of Mount Damavand but had to abandon his climb due to a snowstorm.By June 17, with no flights available and a growing sense of fear, he decided to escape by road, eventually reaching Astara.But the hope he carried with him was quickly replaced by despair.“Despite my best persuasions, I have been told that it would require at least another fortnight for that code to arrive, and I have no idea how I will survive that long in Iran,” he added, his voice cracking.With no access to Azerbaijan without the special code, Dey’s journey to safety -- and a pre-booked hotel room in Baku -- has been indefinitely delayed. The Mumbai-bound flight from Baku that he had booked is now cancelled, along with the hotel reservation made by his family in Kolkata.“No one told me in Tehran that my e-visa wasn’t sufficient to cross over to Azerbaijan by land and that I also need this special migration pass code, especially in a war situation like this,” Dey said. “I wasted no time in starting the application process... but the authorities have responded to me over email stating the process would require a minimum of 15 days.”As he watches other foreigners cross over with ease, Dey said Indians like him are being asked to wait for the migration code, making the situation even more isolating. “There’s a long queue of foreigners over here, and they are having all sorts of visas… But Indians like me have been told that possessing the migration code is mandatory for us to cross.”Though exhausted and facing a growing financial crunch, Dey remains thankful for the help he's received — both from his homeland and strangers along the way. “The vice chancellor of Calcutta University, Santa Dutta, is in constant touch with me. So is mountaineer Debasish Biswas. A senior officer from the Indian embassy’s cultural wing in Tehran, Balaram Shukla, is also helping me out.”Indian embassy officials in Tehran and Baku are reportedly working in coordination to convince Azerbaijan to allow Dey passage given the emergency situation.His 500-km drive from Tehran to Astara was filled with its own set of challenges. With fuel caps in place across Iran, the driver — a local woman from the travel agency had to stop frequently for fuel and basic needs. “They were kind and deeply human. They even brought me fruits and tea, and stayed at the terminal to ensure I was safe.”With no certainty of when the migration code will arrive, Dey is now considering a gruelling eight-hour journey to Armenia’s border, in the hope of finding a faster route out. But the emotional and physical toll is wearing him down.“I am physically and emotionally drained… The uncertainty of reaching home is killing me. All my efforts and the money spent by my family and friends to get me to safety seem to have come to nought,” he said.For now, Falguni Dey’s journey -- which began with the hope of scaling a peak -- has turned into a fight for survival, fuelled by the goodwill of strangers and the prayers of loved ones.Phone numbers to contact the control room - 1800118797 (toll-free), +91-11-23012113, +91-11-23014104, +91-11-23017905, +91-9968291988 (for WhatsApp) - e-mail ID (situationroom@mea.gov.in).","Falguni Dey, a Kolkata-based geography professor and amateur mountaineer, thought the worst was over when he left the chaos of Tehran behind.

UAE's Emergency Preparedness and Past Rescues

On June 4, the National Guard airlifted an injured crew member in his fifties from a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker in UAE waters, flying him to a local hospital for urgent treatment.





On May 18, 13 people were rescued from a sinking picnic boat, in an operation involving both citizens and residents.









In the early hours of Tuesday, June 17, two large vessels, oil tankerand cargo shipcollided approximately 24 nautical miles off the UAE’s eastern coast in the Gulf of Oman. The incident, which occurred at around 1:30 a.m., resulted in minor hull damage to both ships, a small oil spill, and a fire that broke out in the fuel tank of one of the vessels, according to the UAE’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI).According to, thewas moving southbound at 13.1 knots when it executed a starboard (right) turn, colliding with the aft port side of the, which was moving southeast at 4.8 knots.The MoEI confirmed on Wednesday, June 18, that the accident was due to “navigational misjudgment by one of the vessels.” The fire was extinguished following prompt intervention by emergency teams, and no injuries were reported among the crew members of either ship.The two vessels involved are:The UAE National Guard confirmed that 24 crew members aboard the ADALYNN were evacuated by search and rescue boats and taken to the Port of Khor Fakkan. Personnel aboard thewere confirmed safe, and no pollution was reported on that vessel despite the fire on its deck.According to, the fire on thewas under control, and the incident is now under investigation, although the company emphasized that there was “no suggestion of outside interference.”A technical investigation is underway in cooperation with international maritime authorities. The MoEI assured that it would be conducted transparently and in accordance with the highest global maritime standards.The collision took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow and strategic waterway that links the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. This area is critical, as about 20% of the world’s seaborne oi, between 17.8 and 20.8 million barrels per day, according toflows through this route.This maritime zone has recently experienced electronic interference, amid escalating military tensions between Iran and Israel. Since Friday, both countries have exchanged missile fire, and according to maritime security firm, “the incident was not security-related.”Still, concerns remain. The Combined Maritime Force's JMIC information centre noted electronic signal interference in the region, particularly near Iran’s Bandar Abbas port. Although Tehran has not issued any comment on the collision or the reported electronic disruptions, its history of threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz in response to Western pressure has made the area increasingly volatile.As a result:“Rates, for the time being, remain stable with no noticeable increases since the latest hostilities between Israel and Iran,” said, head of marine at insurance broker. “This position could change dramatically depending on any further escalation or general conflagration in the area.”The recent rescue underscores the UAE’s strong maritime emergency response. Just weeks earlier:These coordinated efforts signal a robust and well-prepared emergency response capability from UAE authorities, especially as regional tensions continue to rise.","The Front Eagle, carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil to Zhoushan, China, collided at 13.1 knots with the Adalynn, which was heading empty toward the Suez Canal.

Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday, urging Iran’s military, police, and state employees to join a nationwide uprising against the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic, declaring that its ""fall has begun. ""In a sweeping address to the Iranian people, Pahlavi wrote on X, ""The Islamic Republic has reached its end and is in the process of collapsing. Khamenei, like a frightened rat, has gone into hiding underground and has lost control of the situation. What has begun is irreversible.""He expressed solidarity with those affected by the country’s turmoil and reiterated his long-standing opposition to war. ""In these difficult days, my heart is with all the defenceless citizens who have been harmed and have fallen victim to Khamenei's warmongering and delusions.""Calling the current moment a “sharp turn in history,” Pahlavi asserted, ""The regime’s apparatus of repression is falling apart. All it takes now is a nationwide uprising to put an end to this nightmare once and for all.""Encouraging people across Iranian cities—from Bandar Abbas to Mashhad—to take to the streets, he sought to calm fears of chaos post-regime: ""Do not fear the day after the fall of the Islamic Republic.Iran will not descend into civil war or instability.""He said preparations were already in place: ""We have a plan for Iran’s future and its flourishing. We are prepared for the first hundred days after the fall, for the transitional period, and for the establishment of a national and democratic government—by the Iranian people and for the Iranian people.""To members of Iran’s state apparatus, Pahlavi appealed directly: ""Do not stand against the Iranian people for the sake of a regime whose fall has begun and is inevitable. By standing with the people, you can save your lives.""His call came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced strong support for regime change in Iran during an interview with the opposition-linked Iran International news outlet, saying, ""The regime’s days are numbered… I know that Iran can be great again. It was a great civilization, and this theological thuggery that has kidnapped your country will not stand for long, and you are the future, not them. ""Netanyahu added: ""A light has been lit—carry it to freedom. Your hour of freedom is near; it’s happening now.""Highlighting what he described as widespread dissent, Netanyahu said, ""These dictators in Iran, sure they fear us—but they fear you, the people of Iran, even more. They understand that 80 percent of Iranians despise them.""In a separate interview with Fox News, the Israeli leader indicated that ongoing pressure on Tehran could lead to a change in regime: ""Regime change could certainly be the result.""Citing ancient ties between the Iranian and Jewish people, Netanyahu said, ""The Persian people and the Jewish people have had an ancient friendship that goes back to the times of Cyrus the Great; that could happen again."" He emphasised, however, that the final decision rests with Iranians: ""The decision to act, to rise up, at this time is the decision of the Iranian people.""Israeli PM also confirmed that Israel’s recent strikes, dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion"", were launched based on intelligence that Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to build nine nuclear bombs.","Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday.

Iran Releases Second Video Of Hypersonic Missile Attack On Israel; Fattah-1 Fired Towards Tel Aviv





Israel may be running dangerously low on its stock of Arrow missile interceptors, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal that cites a senior US official.The warning comes as Israel faces an unprecedented volume of ballistic missile attacks from Iran in the sixth day of full-blown conflict between the two countries.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not confirmed any shortage and maintains that its air defence systems are successfully intercepting most incoming missiles. “The IDF is prepared and ready to handle any scenario. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on matters related to munitions,” the military said in a statement.However, the American report suggests that the US has been aware of the problem for months and has quietly bolstered Israel’s defences with additional ground, sea, and air-based systems. The Pentagon has deployed assets including the Patriot and THAAD missile defence systems, while US Navy destroyers are assisting in intercept operations.Israel’s own Arrow system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries, plays a critical role in intercepting long-range ballistic missiles.But with Iran firing hundreds of missiles in recent days, including the advanced Fatah-1 which Tehran says can escape current defence systems, pressure on Israel’s Arrow missile stock is growing.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claim these missiles move at hypersonic speeds, making them harder to stop.Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that US and Israel cannot intercept missiles forever.“Neither the US nor the Israelis can continue to sit and intercept missiles all day. The Israelis and their friends need to move with all deliberate haste to do whatever needs to be done, because we cannot afford to sit and play catch,"" Karako said.Meanwhile, Israel has launched a new wave of attacks on Tehran in broad daylight, using over 50 fighter jets. The IDF said these strikes targeted a centrifuge production facility in Tehran used to enhance uranium enrichment and multiple other military production sites.In response, alerts for hostile aircraft were triggered multiple times on Wednesday morning in the Golan Heights. The IDF reported intercepting seven drones launched from Iran, preventing them from reaching Israeli territory.The escalating crisis has also affected civil aviation. Israeli airline El Al landed its first “Safe Return” evacuation flight from Cyprus at Ben Gurion Airport on Wednesday morning, amid tightened security protocols.Adding fuel to the fire, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on social media: “Force must be used against the Zionist terrorist entity. We will not show leniency toward the Zionists.”US President Donald Trump has said it would be ""easy"" for the superpower to locate and eliminate Iran’s leader.

Oil prices slipped Wednesday following the previous day's surge but investors remained on edge fearing a US intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict after Donald Trump called for Tehran's ""unconditional surrender"".Iran and Israel exchanged missile strikes for a sixth day, with the US president's latest comments appearing to dent hopes that the crisis in the Middle East could be calmed.Leaving the G7 summit in Canada a day early on Monday, Trump said he was aiming for a ""real end"" to the conflict, not just a ceasefire.He later shared a series of social media posts that stoked speculation he could be planning to join Israel in its strikes on Iranian military and nuclear sites.Days after a senior US official said Trump had told Israel to back down from plans to assassinate top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Trump looked to reverse course.""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there -- We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Warning Iran against targeting US interests, he also posted: ""But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers.Our patience is wearing thin.""And in a later post wrote: ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!""The comments sent oil prices spiking more than four percent Tuesday on fears an escalation of the conflict could hammer supplies from the crude-rich region.But while both main contracts slipped Wednesday, investors remain on edge over any negative developments.Of particular concern is the possibility of Iran shutting off the Strait of Hormuz, through which around an estimated fifth of global oil supply traverses, according to a Commerzbank note.""Iran is reportedly ready to target US regional bases should Trump greenlight strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities,"" said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.""Washington's refuelling jets are already en route, and if Fordow gets hit, expect the Strait of Hormuz to become a maritime minefield, Houthi drones to swarm Red Sea shipping lanes, and every militia from Basra to Damascus to light up American forward outposts.""Equity markets Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all sank, though Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and Bangkok edged up.London edged up at the open even as data showed UK inflation slowed less than expected in May.Paris and Frankfurt also rose.The losses followed a weak day on Wall Street, where a below-forecast reading on US retail sales for May -- dragged by a slowdown in auto sales -- revived fresh worries about the world's top economy.

GAZA CITY: Gaza's civil defence agency said 30 people were killed by Israeli fire in the Palestinian territory on Wednesday, including 11 who were seeking aid.The war sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel has ravaged the Gaza Strip, with severe shortages of food, fuel and clean water.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded ""after the occupation forces opened fire and launched several shells... at thousands of citizens"" who had gathered to queue for food in central Gaza.In early March, Israel imposed a total aid blockade on Gaza amid deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May.Since then, chaotic scenes and a string of deadly shootings have occurred near areas where Palestinians have gathered in hope of receiving aid.The civil defence agency said another 19 people were killed in three Israeli strikes on Wednesday, which it said targeted houses and a tent for displaced people.When asked for comment by AFP, the Israeli military said it was ""looking into"" the reports.Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.The UN humanitarian office OCHA said on Monday that its partners ""continue to warn of the risk of famine in Gaza, amid catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity"".The civil defence agency reported that at least 53 people were killed on Tuesday, as they gathered near an aid centre in the southern city of Khan Yunis hoping to receive flour.After Israel eased its blockade, the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began distributing aid in late May, but its operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and dozens of deaths.In a statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that ""to date, not a single incident has occurred at or in the surrounding vicinity of GHF sites nor has an incident occurred during our operating hours"".UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.The Hamas attack which triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, according to Israeli official figures.The Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday that 5,194 people have been killed since Israel resumed major operations in the territory on March 18, ending a two-month truce.The overall death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached 55,493 people, according to the health ministry.","Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded.

In a significant humanitarian gesture, the United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals, including both residents and visitors, regardless of the visa category under which they entered the country. The announcement was made on Tuesday, June 17, by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP).The authority clarified that this decision was made “in response to the exceptional circumstances that the region is witnessing and to provide relief to this group of people who were unable to return to their homeland, due to the closure of airspace and the suspension of flights.”This move follows days of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Since Friday, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a direct air conflict, with Israel launching attacks on nuclear and military sites within Iran. In response, Iran has fired missiles into Israeli territory. As of Tuesday, the conflict has entered its fifth day, severely disrupting commercial air traffic and stranding travelers across the region.The exemption for Iranian nationals was issued under the directives of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The ICP said that the directive aims to provide immediate support to Iranian citizens affected by the conflict-induced travel disruptions.The decision applies to all Iranians present in the UAE, regardless of their visa type or duration of stay. It is part of a broader strategy by the UAE to respond swiftly to international humanitarian needs caused by conflict or crisis.To avail of the waiver, Iranian nationals are encouraged to register through the UAE's smart services platform or visit ICP customer happiness centres located across the country. The exemption is not automatic and requires eligible individuals to complete the registration process.The ICP confirmed that the exemption will remain in effect until December 31, 2025. This generous timeframe offers relief and flexibility for Iranian nationals unable to return home due to airspace closures and geopolitical instability.This is not the first time the UAE has taken such measures in response to conflict. Just last month, Sudanese nationals in the UAE were also granted full exemption from fines related to both residence and entry permits. That policy took effect on May 19, 2025, and was similarly aimed at easing the humanitarian burden caused by the crisis in Sudan.The ICP emphasized that both the Iranian and Sudanese exemptions reflect the UAE's ongoing commitment to supporting affected communities and align with its national efforts to strengthen social and humanitarian well-being among residents.","The United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals.

Gulf waters under watch: Qatar warns of potential regional impact



Nuclear and energy sites struck as conflict enters fifth day



Qatar condemns strikes on energy infrastructure







Amid heightened conflict between Israel and Iran, Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites. On Tuesday, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed that Doha is closely tracking environmental developments in the region, while calling for international awareness of the potential fallout from strikes on sensitive facilities.“We are monitoring this on a daily basis,” al-Ansari said during a news conference.“We have nothing to be concerned about right now, but obviously prolonged escalation will have unpredictable consequences.”Al-Ansari stressed the strategic and environmental importance of the Gulf’s waters, describing them as the region’s primary water source. He warned that any military action targeting nuclear or energy-related facilities could result in outcomes beyond current prediction.“We have to emphasise, when we are talking about the waters of the Gulf, it’s the main source of water for all of us here in the region,” he said.“The international community has to make it very clear that any targeting of nuclear facilities, any targeting of fuel or energy facilities in this region, would have ramifications that are unknown to us in the Gulf.”The current escalation began Friday when Israel launched a major air campaign against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. This marked the start of a now five-day-long exchange of missile strikes between the two countries.Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities, which were among the Israeli targets, are located deep inland. However, Iran also operates a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, situated along the Gulf coast.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran informed the UN nuclear watchdog that the Bushehr plant had not been targeted. The statement was issued by the IAEA on Friday.On Saturday, Israel targeted a significant Iranian gas installation on the Gulf coast. The facility supports the South Pars gas field, a major energy project shared between Iran and Qatar.While confirming that Qatar’s part of the shared gas field remains unaffected, the Qatari government expressed concern over the risks such attacks pose to regional stability.“Qatar's own facilities in the field are secure,” said al-Ansari.Nonetheless, he strongly criticised the Israeli strikes on Iran’s energy assets.He described the actions as “reckless,” adding to Qatar’s calls for de-escalation and urging international stakeholders to prevent further destabilisation in the Gulf.","Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites. Foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed that Doha is closely tracking environmental developments in the region. He warned that any military action targeting nuclear or energy-related facilities could result in outcomes beyond current prediction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121917307,imgsize-1155600,width-400,resizemode-4/121917307.jpg"
Iran-Israel tension: US to join strikes? Vance warns Trump could target Tehran's nuclear program,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-israel-tension-us-to-join-strikes-vance-warns-trump-could-target-tehrans-nuclear-program/articleshow/121914132.cms,"



US Vice-President JD Vance on Tuesday warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme hours after the US president strongly advocated against Tehran possessing any nuclear weapon.""The president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens. He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,"" Vance said in a post X.Clearing the air over US's stance regarding Iran possessing nukes, Vance said, ""First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the Iranians to accomplish this goal. The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways--the easy way or the 'other' way. """"Second, I've seen a lot of confusion over the issue of ""civilian nuclear power"" and ""uranium enrichment."" These are distinct issues. Iran could have civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. Meanwhile, they've enriched uranium far above the level necessary for any civilian purpose.They've been found in violation of their non-proliferation obligations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is hardly a rightwing organization,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Trump had made it clear that Iran ""cannot have nuclear weapons"" saying, ""Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""Israel's recent military operation targeted Iran’s key nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, according to the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A major above-ground section of Natanz, including its power infrastructure, was destroyed, and satellite imagery suggests potential damage to its underground enrichment plant.While no visible damage was found at the deeply buried Fordow enrichment site, the IAEA confirmed that four buildings at the Isfahan facility were hit — including a chemical lab, uranium conversion plant, reactor fuel plant, and a metal processing unit under construction.","US Vice-President JD Vance warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme.

UAE: Sharjah court convicts school staff in death of 8-year-old Indian student Rashid Habib,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sharjah-court-convicts-school-staff-in-death-of-8-year-old-indian-student-rashid-habib/articleshow/121913204.cms,"CCTV footage showed 8-year-old Rashid Habib was left unescorted from the school bus and collapsed while walking alone to class/ Image: (File)





A Sharjah court has convicted two school staff members of negligence in the death of eight-year-old Indian student Rashid Habib, more than a year after he tragically died following a fall at his school in Muwaileh.The Sharjah Federal Court of Appeal overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court and ordered the defendants to pay Dh200,000 in legal blood money to the boy’s family. Additionally, each staff member was fined Dh2,000.The court found that the two staffers had failed in their duty to escort and monitor students from the school bus to their classrooms. CCTV footage reviewed during the investigation showed that Rashid was left unaccompanied at the time of the incident.The Grade 1 student collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024, the first day of Ramadan, shortly after arriving at the CBSE-curriculum school.He was rushed to Al Qassimi Hospital in a state of cardiac arrest but was declared dead despite resuscitation attempts.A forensic report from Sharjah Police stated that Rashid had sustained a bruise on his face, a fractured cheekbone, internal bleeding under the scalp, and severe brain injuries, including swelling and bleeding.Surveillance footage confirmed that no school staff were present with the children during the incident. The footage also showed that another child had attempted to hit Rashid moments before he fell. However, the crucial seconds capturing the exact moment of the fall were missing.The appeal court ruled that the staff’s absence amounted to gross negligence, emphasising that the accident could likely have been prevented had the staff been present.Rashid’s father, Habib Yasar, told Khaleej Times: “Not a day goes by when we don’t remember Rashid. Our lives have never been the same. We keep thinking of what could have been if someone had just been there to watch over him. Why was there no CCTV camera? A school is supposed to be like a second home, but it didn’t take care of my child. This conviction brings some closure, but the pain remains. We lost a part of ourselves that day. ”The family had previously claimed Rashid was bullied and attacked during the missing seconds, a charge the school denied.Due to ongoing legal and administrative proceedings, the name of the school involved is being withheld.",Rashid Habib collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024.
