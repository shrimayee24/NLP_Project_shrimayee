"The Ayatollah’s gamble: Fight, fold, or fall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/the-ayatollahs-gamble-fight-fold-or-fall-how-far-will-iran-go-against-israel/articleshow/121887083.cms,"Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during a meeting with teachers, in Tehran, Iran. (File photo)

Why it matters

This is no longer a proxy conflict. Israel has directly struck inside Iran, and Iran has retaliated with direct missile fire on Israeli population centers. The scale, speed, and ferocity of the strikes mark a dangerous new phase with no clear off-ramp - and Iran’s regime is facing pressure on all fronts: militarily, economically, diplomatically and domestically.

It’s the worst direct confrontation between Iran and Israel in history. The war could spiral into a broader Middle East conflagration, upend global oil markets, and collapse already-stalled nuclear diplomacy.

Energy implications: Crude oil surged 13% on Friday - the biggest intraday gain since Russia invaded Ukraine. While oil briefly hit $78 per barrel, experts warn prices could soar past $100 if Iran disrupts the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of global oil flows.

The big picture

Iran now faces a triad of perilous choices

Escalate - risking full-scale war with Israel and possible US involvement. Contain the conflict - aiming for limited, sustained strikes while avoiding American red lines. Negotiate - possibly with US mediation - to halt the fighting and restore nuclear talks, though trust is virtually nonexistent.

Between the lines

Zoom in

Its economy is ravaged by years of sanctions.

Inflation hovers around 40%.

Blackouts and gas shortages are becoming the norm.

And the rial continues to plummet, stoking anger in a young, restless population.

Israel vs Iran

The ultimate test for Khamenei

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader and political survivor for over three decades, is now confronting what may be the defining crisis of his rule.

In a sign of how far Israel was willing to push, a US official told the Associated Press that President Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei.

Since taking power in 1989 after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei has survived sanctions, internal unrest, and international isolation.

But the current conflict with Israel is different: it directly challenges not only the regional influence he has carefully built but also the internal balance of power in Tehran. The stakes are now existential.

At 86, Khamenei’s advanced age has already fueled speculation about succession, a process clouded by secrecy and rival factions within the regime. “Khamenei is at the twilight of his rule, at the age 86, and already much of the daily command of the regime is not up to him but to various factions who are vying for the future,” said Arash Azizi, senior fellow at Boston University. “This process was already underway and the current war only accelerates it,” he told AFP.

And with Israel not ruling out future attempts on his life, the supreme leader’s next moves will shape not just Iran’s response, but the future of the system he’s spent a lifetime defending.

What they’re saying

“Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video. “Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.”

Trump said Sunday: “We will have PEACE, soon… But sometimes they have to fight it out.”

“This is for the sake of our children and grandchildren,” said Yoram Suki, whose apartment was destroyed in Petah Tikva.

Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi: “Once these Israeli] attacks come to a stop, we will naturally reciprocate.”

Iran has thousands of ballistic missiles so I think Iranian leaders will use most of those missiles and kill a few thousand of Americans before they engage in a surrender. Iran’s hope was a peaceful resolution. The Americans didn’t want to have it, they wanted war and I think that’s what they’re going to get. Fouad Izadi, an academic at Tehran University , told Bloomberg

What to watch

What’s next

Israel is pushing hard to rally Western support to destroy Iran’s nuclear capacity. But analysts say Israel would need US military assistance to breach Iran’s deepest, most protected sites.

The US role remains murky: President Donald Trump has both urged de-escalation and praised Israel’s offensive. He’s also confirmed vetoing an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, calling it a red line.

Iran’s Gulf-Arab neighbors-countries it’s reconnected with over the past two years-are alarmed by Israel’s moves and want no part in the conflict, say senior regional officials. While Iran has the missile capability to hit oil facilities and infrastructure across the region, it’s not likely to risk damaging those newly rebuilt ties. It understands that these neighbors fear getting caught in the crossfire and are pressing Trump to cool things down.

The G7 summit in Canada is now dominated by discussions on how to prevent further escalation. “This issue will be very high on the agenda,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Reality check





Iran unleashed a wave of over 100 missiles on Israeli cities early Monday, killing five and injuring more than 100 - striking Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Petah Tikva. The attack followed Israel’s surprise air campaign that bombarded Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, killing at least 224 people - many of them civilians - and decimating the upper ranks of the Revolutionary Guard.The tit-for-tat marks the fourth straight day of open warfare between the regional archrivals and shows no signs of de-escalation.Each carries enormous risks for Iran’s clerical leadership. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei must weigh strategic retaliation against the very real prospect of regime collapse or American firepower.The Israeli strikes have been more devastating and targeted than many in Tehran expected.Israel claims it has killed high-ranking commanders and destroyed key uranium enrichment facilities. The shock of the attacks has set off panic among Tehran residents, particularly in the north, where middle-class Iranians are fleeing to rural areas or Caspian towns.“We just don’t know where to go or what to do,’’ said Parisa, a gym owner in northern Tehran. “The highways are locked. People are saying something bad is going to happen in Tehran tonight.”As per a Bloomberg report, Iran’s domestic situation is fragile:Just days before the Israeli strikes, anti-government protests were already flaring over water shortages and job losses.Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it employed a “new method” in Monday’s missile barrage that overwhelmed Israeli air defenses, including the Iron Dome, allowing strikes to penetrate deeper than before. The damage was visible: residential buildings collapsed, fires erupted, and even the US Embassy in Tel Aviv sustained minor damage.If Iran escalates further - for example, by activating Hezbollah in Lebanon or shutting the Strait of Hormuz - it could trigger US military involvement, upending Trump’s desire to stay out.A senior US official confirmed that Trump was aware of the Israeli strike plan in advance but refused to participate, preferring to maintain the ability to mediate a ceasefire.While Iran can likely sustain limited strikes on Israel for weeks, it is constrained. It cannot match Israel’s precision airpower or resupply at the pace that Israel can - especially with US backing.A prolonged war would deepen its economic pain, risk regime legitimacy, and possibly spur a new wave of protests.(With inputs from agencies)","Iran now faces a triad of perilous choices: Escalate - risking full-scale war with Israel and possible US involvement.

NEW DELHI: With Israel and Iran teetering on the brink of a full-blown war, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said resolving issues through dialogue and restoring stability was the cry of humanity. Speaking alongside Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides in Nicosia, Modi reiterated his message that this isn't the era of war.Modi's visit to Cyprus - the first by an Indian PM in 23 years - saw the two sides discussing efforts to scale up cooperation in defence, security and connectivity with focus on IMEEC, with the PM strongly backing sovereignty and territorial integrity of the eastern Mediterranean country that is not recognised by Turkiye, a Pakistan ally.""We both have expressed concern about the ongoing conflicts in West Asia and Europe. Their negative impact is not limited to that region alone. We both believe that this is not the era of war,"" Modi said after his talks with the Cypriot president.Modi thanked Cyprus for its continued support to India's fight against cross-border terrorism and announced a new mechanism for real-time information exchange to counter terrorism, drug and arms smuggling.The president reiterated Cyprus's strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, backing India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.In a show of solidarity with Cyprus, Modi visited the Green Line - a UN-controlled buffer zone that separates Northern Cyprus, an area occupied by Turkish forces in 1974, from the Republic of Cyprus - along with Christodoulides. This is significant in the context of Turkiye's continued support to Pakistan that saw Ankara helping Islamabad militarily during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. Turkish President Recep Erdogan himself later said Turkiye would continue to stand by Pakistan, though ""good times and bad"".Modi also reiterated India's traditional support for Cyprus's unity and for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus Question based on UN Security Council resolutions and international law. Several of these resolutions call for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from the island of Cyprus.""India reiterated its unwavering and consistent support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. In this regard, both sides emphasised the need to avoid unilateral actions as essential for creating a conducive environment for the resumption of meaningful negotiations,"" said a joint statement.Modi said the two sides would prepare a roadmap to give a strategic direction to the partnership for the next five years.On the issue of terrorism, both sides reiterated in a joint statement their zero-tolerance approach to terrorism, rejecting any justification for such acts, under any circumstances. ""They emphasised that those responsible for the attacks should be held accountable,"" said the statement, while condemning the Pahalgam attack.","Modi's visit to Cyprus - the first by an Indian PM in 23 years - saw the two sides discussing efforts to scale up cooperation in defence, security and connectivity.

A growing sense of fear and panic has taken hold across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Israel continues to vow further military strikes. Amid threats of new airstrikes, many Iranians are fleeing major cities in search of safety, with traffic jams clogging roads leading north toward the Caspian Sea.On Monday, the Israeli military issued a chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately.""""In the coming hours, the Israeli military will operate in the area, as it has in recent days throughout Tehran, to strike military infrastructure of the Iranian regime,"" the post read.A resident of Saadat Abad, an affluent neighbourhood in north Tehran that has reportedly been struck in recent days, described a night filled with explosions.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.

Nagpur: A simple act of courtesy and kindness — letting a sick teenager and her grandmother board the helicopter first — spared the lives of a couple from the fatal helicopter crash near Kedarnath on Sunday. Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their two-year-old daughter Kashi, who were among the seven killed when the chopper went down minutes after take-off.On Sunday morning, the group was waiting at the Kedarnath helipad with the Jaiswals for the first sortie to Gaurikund when an elderly woman in the queue requested that she and her unwell granddaughter be allowed to go first. Pravin let them take his family's place in the queue and opting to wait for the next helicopter. Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""The woman requested that her granddaughter had fever and she needed to reach the Gaurikund base soon. I allowed them to board,"" he said.The family of Rajkumar Jaiswal, 41, who was a prominent coal transporter from Wani, and the Mahajans had gone to Kedarnath for a pilgrimage on Saturday and were returning to the Gaurikund chopper base after praying at the shrine.Their plan was to return on the same day, but the sorties were cancelled due to bad weather.""We reached the Kedarnath shrine on Saturday at 9.30am. Our plan was to return by noon. No other sortie was allowed after the first batch took off to the base. The next flight was at 5am on Sunday. Two other choppers also took off from Kedarnath around the same time and reached safely,"" Pravin said.Jaiswal is survived by his two sons and mother.The Jaiswal couple had left 10-year-old son Vivan at his maternal uncle's place in Pandharkawada, also in Yavatmal district. His elder son, who lives in a hostel, did not join either.Jaiswal, a respected name in coal logistics in the region, was also known for his community engagement and religious nature. In January 2024, he had hosted widely-attended ‘Kashi Shiv Mahapuran Katha' in Wani. The event was inspired by his daughter's name Kashi, said sources. Many in the town remember him as a person who had held the week-long spiritual discourse. As news of the crash spread, residents gathered at the Jaiswal residence in disbelief and mourning.The Jaiswals and Mahajans had started off on June 11. ""First, they reached Kolkata and visited the Kali Temple there. From there, they reached Uttarakhand. On Friday, they called me up to say that they were in Devprayag in Uttarakhand and had also posted a reel on social media about their pilgrimage at Kedarnath,"" said Ritesh Khanduri, his friend.Ashish Jaiswal, Jaiswal's immediate neighbour, said he came to know about the incident at around 7am when Mahajan called him. By 11.30am, Mahajan and his wife began the travel down on mules and reached the base in over four hours . ""Helicopter services are not available due to the crash. We are being escorted by cops, and a number of other pilgrims have also joined the journey downwards. We had to pay for the mule ride,"" Mahajan said.As TOI again contacted him at 4pm, Mahajan said he was yet to receive any information about the mortal remains of the Jaiswal family.","Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their two-year-old daughter Kashi.

Thousands of Spectrum customers across the Los Angeles area experienced significant internet and cable outages on Sunday, June 15, 2025, after the company confirmed that its fiber optic lines were intentionally cut due to ""criminal acts of vandalism."" The widespread disruption particularly impacted communities in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, and surrounding areas. The company reported that over 25,000 users were affected at the peak of the outage. The company emphasised that these acts of network vandalism have become a growing concern affecting the entire telecommunications industry, often driven by the misconception that fiber optic lines contain valuable precious metals like copper.Spectrum issued an alert via its official X (formerly Twitter) account, stating, ""We are currently working on a Fiber cut affecting the Los Angeles area. We are sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Thank you."" A company spokesperson later elaborated to news outlets that the fiber optic lines were deliberately severed in Van Nuys early Sunday(June 15) morning.Spectrum said it is working closely with the Los Angeles Police Department and has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.

INDORE: As the 13th-day death ritual (tehrvi) of Raja Raghuvanshi was held on Monday in Indore, a pall of grief hung heavily over the Raghuvanshi family.The family, still struggling to come to terms with Raja’s murder during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, prepared all of his favourite dishes for the private ritual — gulab jamun, Manchurian, noodles, dal-chawal, dry fruits, bananas, and papaya — as a tribute to the 29-year-old transport businessman.“We are not organising it like a typical tehrvi for a natural death,” said Raja’s brother, Sachin Raghuvanshi.“Only family members are participating and the same question keeps haunting us — why did Sonam get her husband murdered just days after their wedding?,"" said Sachin.Meanwhile, Sonam's brother Govind attended the tehrvi in Indore.“Shillong police have called me for questioning. They said I need to give a statement and sign it,” he said.Raja was killed during his honeymoon in Sohra (Cherrapunjee) in Meghalaya last month. His wife, Sonam Raghuvanshi, is in police custody along with four others — all from outside Meghalaya — for their alleged involvement in the murder.On Monday, Sonam was taken to the Meghalaya Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences for a psychiatric evaluation and was found mentally sound, police sources said.Police are planning to take the five accused to Sohra on Tuesday to recreate the crime scene as part of the ongoing investigation.Earlier, a local court had granted eight days of police remand for all accused on June 11. Authorities are now likely to seek an extension.Back in Indore, the grief-stricken family continues to demand answers. Raja’s father and brothers have called for narco-analysis tests on all five accused, including Sonam, hoping to uncover the full truth behind the murder.“We still can’t believe this happened just days after their marriage,” Sachin said. “It’s not just about justice anymore — it’s about understanding why this happened.”Adding a new dimension to the investigation, a photographer named Dev aka Devender Singh from Sonipat, Haryana, has shared a video on social media, saying it shows Sonam and Raja crossing Meghalaya’s iconic Double-Decker Root Bridge in Sohra.According to Dev, the video was taken by chance around 9:45am on May 23 when the honeymooners came into his viewfinder.Raja’s brother, Vipin Raghuvanshi, confirmed that it’s indeed Raja and Sonam in the video.

'New Iran...': Trump Abruptly Leaves G7 Summit After Tehran Evacuation Call; US Attack Next?

HELLSCAPE Tel Aviv! Iran’s Terrifying Attack Quakes Israeli City; IDF ‘Fails’ To Intercept Missiles





US President Donald Trump abruptly left the G-7 summit in Calgary on Monday evening to attend to security related issues in the middle east, scuppering a planned bilateral engagement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived for the meeting even as Trump's departure was announced.Trump was at the summit for less than 24 hours before his sudden departure, with White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt asserting that ""much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.""Moments earlier, Trump alarmed the world by urging ""Everyone should immediately evacuate Teheran"" at the tail end of a post that read: “Iran should have signed the ‘deal’ I told them to sign. “What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again!""Trump is expected to go straight into a National Security Council meeting in the WH Situation room when he arrives in Washington DC, amid speculation that the US will join the Israeli attack to end Iran's nuclear program with one decisive move: Dropping a bunker-busted carried by American B-2 bombers -- the only weapon short of a nuclear bomb that can destroy the deeply buried nuclear enrichment facility at Fordo.Also read: Trump slams Iran for ignoring nuclear deal; US skips G7’ de-escalation call Formally called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or the GBU-57, the 20 feet long bunker-buster weights 13600 kgs and can be lifted only by a B-2 bomber, neither of which Israel has even though it is a close US ally. Some experts reckon the US would have to use several GBU-57s to accomplish the mission of entombing Fordo, which war hawks see as the only way to decisively end Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Anything short of that will allow Iran to continue its pursuit of the atomic bomb.Trump decision to support Israel's attack on Iran and back it up heavy-duty munitions where his mouth is has alarmed several MAGA acolytes who are screaming that he is betraying his America First promise and embroiling the country in a war that is not of vital interest to the US.Among the first to break ranks is influential commentator Tucker Carlson, who went on a podcast with Steve Bannon (another isolationist), to argue that the US, already financially strapped, would only be weakened by getting involved in another war.A stung Trump, shot back with a post saying ""Someone please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that Iran can not have a nuclear weapon!""Carlson and some other MAGA principals have contended that the threat of Iran acquiring nukes is exaggerated and that there is not credible evidence that it is close to making a bomb. Among the few lawmakers who have dared to come out against Trump gradually putting US into the war is Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said ""Anyone slobbering for the U.S. to become fully involved in the Israel/Iran war is not America First/MAGA. """"Wishing for murder of innocent people is disgusting. We are sick and tired of foreign wars. All of them.

Leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the US, along with the European Union, are convening in the resort area of Kananaskis in the Canadian Rockies until Tuesday.With an escalating Israel-Iran conflict, the summit is seen as a vital moment to try to restore a semblance of unity among democratic powerhouses.In an early sign they may struggle to reach agreement on key issues, a US official said Trump would not sign a draft statement calling for de-escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict. Asked about reports that Iran wants to work toward a resolution, Trump responded ""yeah"", and added, ""they'd like to talk, but they should have done that before."" ""...I would say that Iran is not winning this war,"" Trump said at the start of a meeting with Canadian PM Mark Carney.Trump then asserted that it was a ""very big mistake"" to remove Russia in 2014 after it annexed Crimea, a move that precipitated Russia's wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022.""I think you wouldn't have a war right now if you had Russia in, and you wouldn't have a war right now if Trump were president four years ago,"" he said.Asked by a reporter if China should also be added, Trump said: ""It's not a bad idea.

NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Monday condemned the bloody terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, declaring that it would be stepping up its scrutiny of how effectively countries are combating terror financing.“Terrorist attacks kill, maim and inspire fear around the world. The FATF notes with grave concern and condemns the brutal terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025. This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters,” the global watchdog said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.The FATF's remarks come as India continues to highlight Pakistan’s alleged role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism and diverting international financial aid towards arms procurement. Sources suggested to PTI that Pakistan's activities warrant a fresh push to bring the country back into FATF’s ""grey list"".On April 22, Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians in Kashmir's Pahalgam. New Delhi has repeatedly highlighted how Pakistan has been offering safe haven to designated terrorists. The claim gained further traction when senior Pakistani military officials reportedly attended the funerals of terrorists killed in Indian military strikes on May 7.In preparation for the upcoming Asia Pacific Group (APG) meeting on August 25 and the FATF plenary and working group sessions on October 20, India is compiling a detailed dossier on Pakistan’s alleged violations and lapses under FATF’s anti-money laundering and terror financing guidelines. India has planned to formally press for Pakistan’s grey listing at these meetings.At present, 24 countries are under FATF’s “grey list,” which flags nations under increased monitoring due to strategic weaknesses in combating money laundering, terror financing, and proliferation financing.Grey-listed countries are required to quickly address these vulnerabilities under FATF’s close watch.Pakistan’s association with the grey list has been long and intermittent. First added to the list in February 2008, Pakistan was removed in June 2010, only to return in February 2012. It was dropped again in February 2015 but was re-listed in June 2018 and remained under scrutiny until October 2022, when FATF removed Pakistan but advised continued cooperation with the Asia Pacific Group to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing systems.The FATF, which serves as the international standard-setter for fighting money laundering and terror financing, stated in its statement that it is working alongside over 200 jurisdictions to bolster counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) frameworks worldwide, using financial intelligence as a key weapon to break terror funding chains.""In addition to setting out the framework for combating terrorist financing, the FATF has enhanced its focus on the effectiveness of measures countries have put in place. That is how, through our mutual evaluations, we have identified gaps that need to be addressed,"" the FATF said.For more than a decade, the watchdog has been working to help countries stay ahead of terrorist financing threats, including the exploitation of social media platforms, crowdfunding, and digital assets.""The FATF will soon release a comprehensive analysis of terrorist financing, compiling cases provided by our global network. It will also host a webinar to help public and private sectors understand the risks and stay alert to emerging threats,"" the statement added.At the recent ‘No Money for Terror Conference’ in Munich, FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo stressed the importance of global cooperation, saying: ""No single company, authority, or country can combat this challenge alone. We must be unified against the scourge of global terrorism. Because terrorists need to succeed only once to achieve their goal, while we have to succeed every time to prevent it.""",The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Monday condemned the bloody terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22.

MINNEAPOLIS: The man accused of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another went to the homes of two other legislators on the night of the shootings, a federal prosecutor said Monday. But one of the other lawmakers was on vacation and the suspect left the other house after police arrived early Saturday, acting attorney Joseph Thompson said.The suspect, Vance Boelter, meticulously planned out the attacks, carrying out surveillance missions and disguising himself as a police officer on the night of the attacks. A list of about 70 names was found from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said officials. The list included state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates.Boelter surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt over nearly two days. He is accused of fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in their home. He also shot senator John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife.","Vance Boelter is accused of fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in their home.

PARIS: The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, remained shuttered Monday - not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilisation's greatest treasures - paralysed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.And yet, the moment felt bigger than a labour protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism - a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.The strike erupted during a routine meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called ""untenable"" working conditions. ""It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,"" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath IM Pei's glass pyramid.The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over - water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers, that promised future feels distant. ""Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art - it's about the people protecting it,"" Sarah Sefian of CGT-Culture union.At the centre of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa, a 16th-century portrait that draws crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des Etats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass.Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the ""Louvre New Renaissance,"" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.Until then, France's greatest cultural treasure - and the crowds who flock to it - remain caught between the cracks.","The world's most-visited museum was shuttered Monday by its own exhausted staff.

The Trump administration is planning a major expansion of its travel ban, which could soon cover citizens from 36 additional countries. Earlier this month, the Republican president issued an order blocking citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States.According to an internal US State Department cable seen by Reuters and first reported by the Washington Post, these nations risk being added to the list unless they address specific security concerns within 60 days.The cable, signed by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, lists various issues that have triggered these concerns. Among them are countries failing to issue reliable identity documents, having weak or uncooperative governments, poor passport security, and refusing to accept their citizens who have been ordered to leave the United States.Some countries were also flagged for their citizens' involvement in terrorism, antisemitic activities, or anti-American actions. However, the cable noted that not every concern applied to all countries listed.During Trump’s first term, he had already introduced a controversial travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations, a policy that faced multiple legal challenges before being upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018.The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month, which already restricts travel from 12 nations such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. There are also partial restrictions on travellers from countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, and Sierra Leone.","The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month.

US President Donald Trump on Monday slammed the Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau administration for excluding Russia from the G8 member nations which then became G7. Calling it a ""serious mistake"", he added that if he would have been the president, there wouldn't have been a Russia-Ukraine war.""The G7 used to be the G8. About nine years ago, Russia was excluded, something I believe was a serious mistake.

If I was the president 4 years ago, we would not have a war right now,"" he said.The G7 temporarily became the G8 when Russia was included as a member, but the country was expelled in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea and initial incursion into Ukraine—developments that laid the groundwork for its full-scale invasion in 2022.Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone call on Saturday and the two agreed that the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel should come to an end.“President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran, a country he knows very well,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end,” he added.The call also briefly touched on Russia’s war in Ukraine and ongoing prisoner exchanges. Trump noted that while Ukraine wasn’t the main focus of the call, they discussed upcoming exchanges and Putin's interest in resuming peace talks after June 22.","The G7 temporarily became the G8 when Russia was included as a member, but the country was expelled in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea and initial incursion into Ukraine.

Netanyahu makes SHOCKING claim about Trump assassination attempts, his own





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu said, ""They want to kill him. He’s enemy number one.""Netanyahu also praised Trump for taking a tough stand against Iran's nuclear programme, rejecting previous agreements that allowed uranium enrichment and cancelling the nuclear deal. Netanyahu said Trump’s actions — including ordering the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani — made him a key target for Tehran.""He took up this fake agreement and basically tore it up. He killed Qasem Soleimani. He made it very clear, including now, 'You cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means you cannot enrich uranium.' He's been very forceful, so for them, he's enemy number one,"" Fox News quoted Netanyahu as saying.The Israeli leader also revealed that his own life was targeted when a missile struck the bedroom window of his home. Calling himself Trump’s ""junior partner"" in confronting Iran, Netanyahu said both leaders have stood firm against Tehran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.Describing the current situation, Netanyahu warned that Israel faced an ""imminent"" threat of nuclear destruction. He said Iran was moving fast to weaponise enriched uranium and expand its ballistic missile arsenal, producing thousands of missiles capable of striking Israeli cities. ""No country can sustain that, and certainly not a country the size of Israel, so we had to act,"" he said.Netanyahu defended Israel’s military campaign, Operation Rising Lion, calling it ""one of the greatest military operations in history."" He said the strikes have significantly set back Iran’s nuclear programme and dismissed the possibility of meaningful negotiations with Tehran.He also accused Iran's leaders of oppressing their people for 50 years while pursuing the destruction of Israel.","Netanyahu claims Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.

Leaders of Group of Seven (G7) nations meeting in Canada on Monday issued a joint statement declaring that ""Iran can never have a nuclear weapon,"" while calling for immediate de-escalation across the Middle East.The statement comes days after Israel conducted its Operation Rising Lion to hit Iran's nuclear facilities.In the joint statement, the G7 reaffirmed its stance on Iran’s nuclear ambitions and voiced support for Israel’s right to self-defence.""We affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself,"" the statement said. ""We have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.""The leaders urged that the resolution of the Iranian crisis be part of a broader effort to calm the region.

HELLSCAPE Tel Aviv! Iran’s Terrifying Attack Quakes Israeli City; IDF ‘Fails’ To Intercept Missiles





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" and warned the situation is approaching the ""brink of a nuclear war.""In a wide-ranging interview with ABC News, Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.When asked about reports that US President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Khamenei due to fears of escalation, Netanyahu countered, ""It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.""The remarks come as tensions between Israel and Iran have surged since a wave of airstrikes and missile exchanges erupted late last week. Netanyahu squarely blamed Iran for regional instability, pointing to its alleged involvement in attacks across the Middle East.""We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in the Middle East; has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia; is spreading terrorism and subversion and sabotage everywhere,"" he said.""The 'forever war' is what Iran wants, and they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.""Asked directly if Israel would target Iran’s supreme leader, Netanyahu responded, ""We're doing what we need to do."" He added, ""I'm not going to get into the details, but we've targeted their top nuclear scientists. It's basically Hitler's nuclear team.""Netanyahu appealed to American interests, warning that the threat Iran poses is not limited to Israel. ""Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand 'America First'. I don't understand 'America Dead'. That's what these people want. They chant 'Death to America.'""""So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind, of humanity, and it's a battle of good against evil. America does, should, and does stand with the good. That's what President Trump is doing, And I deeply appreciate his support,"" he said.The Israeli leader also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that Iran is seeking to de-escalate and resume nuclear talks. ""I'm not surprised. I mean, they want to continue to have these fake talks in which they lie, they cheat, they string the US along. And, you know, we have very solid Intel on that,"" he said. ""They want to keep on building their nuclear weapons and building their mass ballistic missile arsenal, which they're firing at our people. ""He rejected the idea of halting strikes in exchange for renewed diplomacy, adding, ""They want to continue to create the two existential threats against Israel while they're talking. That's not going to happen.""When asked about criticism from US conservatives like commentator Tucker Carlson who oppose military support for Israel, Netanyahu reiterated the global threat he believes Iran poses: ""Iran is a threat to the entire world.""The Israeli PM again echoed his recent birthday message to President Trump, saying, ""We're not just fighting our enemy. We're fighting your enemy. For God's sake, they chant, 'death to Israel, death to America.' We're simply on their way. And this could reach America soon.""Pressed on whether he would halt military action if President Trump requested a diplomatic pause, Netanyahu was non-committal but praised Trump’s leadership: ""Well, President Trump has been a great leader, a great leader of the world, and a great leader and a great friend of Israel, and he put forward the terms very clearly in the negotiations.""""He said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and in order for it not to have a nuclear weapon, it cannot have the capacity to enrich uranium, which is the prerequisite for nuclear weapons.""","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

As night attacks stretch into Tuesday morning, global leaders express concern while military actions intensify between Israel and Iran. Confrontation have escalated sharply, with fresh explosions reported in Tehran late Monday night.State-linked Fars News Agency said Iran’s air defences were activated over the capital after blasts were heard in the eastern part of the city.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel. A spokesman for the Guards said these attacks would continue “without interruption until dawn,” highlighting Iran’s intent to sustain pressure overnight.In a retaliatory warning, Iranian authorities have told Israel to evacuate the headquarters of Channels 12 and 14. This followed an Israeli airstrike on IRINN, a state-run television channel in Tehran on Monday, which forced a news presenter to flee during a live broadcast.Iranian authorities have claimed that they uncovered and shut down a drone manufacturing site in Tehran allegedly linked to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. According to Iranian state media, two individuals accused of working with Mossad were arrested in separate operations in Tehran and Alborz provinces.The Israel Defence Forces have confirmed missile detections across several areas following Iran’s latest wave of attacks. Sirens were activated as part of emergency procedures, and the Israeli Air Force has launched strikes on missile infrastructure in western Iran. Israeli officials claim to have achieved air superiority over Tehran, saying that a significant portion of Iran’s missile launchers has already been destroyed.The United States has moved quickly to adjust its military posture in the Middle East. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the deployment of additional assets to the region, saying the move is meant to enhance the safety of American forces. In a statement on social media, Hegseth said, “Protecting US forces is our top priority”.Tehran has submitted a formal complaint to the United Nations, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its nuclear facilities. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, Iran’s representative, Amir Saeid Iravani, cited recent Israeli airstrikes on the Natanz nuclear complex and referred to a 1981 Security Council resolution condemning similar actions.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has strongly criticised Israel’s actions, saying they undermine ongoing nuclear negotiations with the United States. During calls with foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, and the European Union, Araghchi said that Israel’s military aggression is “a blow to diplomacy.”US president Donald Trump has urged Iran to agree to a deal, repeating his warning that Iran must not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. In a social media post, he told residents of Tehran to “immediately evacuate” and criticised Iran for not signing the deal he had earlier proposed. Despite the worsening crisis, Trump has not joined other G7 leaders in calling for de-escalation. The White House later confirmed that Trump would leave the G7 summit in Canada a day early to focus on the unfolding conflict.","Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel.

Israel and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other on Sunday, killing scores of civilians and raising fears of a wider conflict, and US President Trump said it could be ended easily while warning Tehran not to strike any US targets.In Israel, rescue teams combed through rubble of residential buildings destroyed by Iranian missiles, using sniffer dogs and heavy excavators to look for survivors after at least 10 people, including children, were killed, raising the two-day toll to 13. Sirens rang out across the country after 4 pm on Sunday in the first such daylight alert, and fresh explosions could be heard in Tel Aviv. Israel said since Friday 390 people have been wounded. Iran has fired over 270 missiles, 22 of which got through the country's sophisticated multi-tiered air defences, according to Israeli figures. Israel's main international airport and airspace remained closed for a third day.In Iran, images from the capital showed the night sky lit up by a huge blaze at a fuel depot after Israel began strikes against Iran's oil and gas sector, raising the stakes for the global economy and the functioning of the Iranian state.Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault. The Israeli military, in a social media post, warned Iranians to evacuate arms factories, signalling a further widening of the campaign. Explosions shook Tehran around noon and again around 3.30 pm.Israeli strikes targeted Iran's defence ministry early Sunday after hitting air defences, military bases and sites associated with its nuclear programme. Israel claimed it attacked an Iranian refuelling aircraft in Mashhad in the NE, calling it the farthest strike the military had yet carried out.
