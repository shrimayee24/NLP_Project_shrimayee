Trial court erred: Allahabad high court; man freed after 24 years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trial-court-erred-allahabad-high-court-man-freed-after-24-years-in-jail/articleshow/126168987.cms,"Representative image

PRAYAGRAJ: Noting that the trial court failed to notice that the appellant was confessing to a crime out of fear for his life, the Allahabad high court has overturned the conviction of a man who spent almost 24 years in prison after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a dacoity case.The trial court had in 2002 delivered its verdict based solely on his admission in his statements recorded under CrPC Section 313. A division bench of Justice JJ Munir and Justice Sanjiv Kumar found fault with the trial judge for failing to notice that the appellant was confessing out of fear for his life.The high court concluded that the trial court erred in convicting the appellant as the prosecution had failed to connect him with the offence. Consequently, the court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted Azad Khan of all charges. He is to be released forthwith from Mainpuri jail, the high court directed.The division bench ruled in its Dec 19 order that a conviction cannot be premised solely on an admission made in a statement under CrPC Sec 313, especially when the prosecution fails to adduce any corroborative or incriminating evidence.The court termed the incarceration of Azad Khan for almost 24 years as the sad part of the matter, noting that his so-called admission of guilt was likely driven by fear for his life rather than being a genuine confession.The Allahabad high court also noted that the appellant had no assistance of an advocate to defend himself and was not offered or provided any legal aid, which violated the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution (right to life and personal liberty) and also constituted a violation of CrPC Sec 304, which mandates legal aid, at the state's expense, for the accused.In Feb 2002, the appellant was convicted under ICP Secs 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) by the special judge (DAA)/additional sessions judge, Mainpuri.",Azad Khan spent almost 24 years in prison after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a dacoity case. The Allahabad high court found fault with the trial judge for failing to notice that the appellant was confessing out of fear for his life.

Gujarat: High court lets off dad on death row for pregnant teen’s rape and murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-high-court-lets-off-dad-on-death-row-for-pregnant-teens-rape-and-murder/articleshow/126168975.cms,"Gujarat: High court lets off dad on death row for pregnant teen’s rape and murder

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has acquitted a father sentenced to death by a Surat trial court for the rape and murder of his pregnant teenage daughter, citing procedural lapses for refusing to accept the DNA report that led to his conviction as “credible evidence”.The case involves a 14-year-old migrant girl from Odisha whose body was found on Surat’s Dumas beach on June 29, 2017. An autopsy revealed she was pregnant and had been strangled to death. After her father’s arrest based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution relied on DNA matching of the foetus and the accused to build what became the “cornerstone” of his Jan 2020 conviction under IPC and the Pocso Act.The case was turned on its head when the state govt sought the high court’s confirmation of the death sentence. “The prosecution failed to prove all necessary circumstances by reliable and clinching evidence, which would constitute a complete chain without a snap, as would permit a conclusion other than the one of the guilt of the accused,” the division bench of Justices Ilesh Vora and R T Vachhani said.The judges ruled that DNA samples of the victim’s unborn baby and the accused may have been “compromised” due to multiple lapses, including a 13-day delay in submitting these to the designated forensic laboratory and failure to preserve highly sensitive biological material in an ice box.","The case involves a 14-year-old migrant girl from Odisha.

Consensual relation with student is not sex harassment: Allahabad high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensual-relation-with-student-is-not-sex-harassment-allahabad-high-court/articleshow/126168950.cms,"Representative image

PRAYAGRAJ: A teacher being in a consensual relationship with his student amounts to misconduct but not sexual harassment, Allahabad high court has ruled, setting aside a 19-year-old dismissal order of a lecturer of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Prayagraj.Allowing a writ petition filed by the sacked lecturer, Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery, in his Dec 16 order, observed that while the petitioner may not have adhered to the high moral standards expected of a teacher, the extreme penalty of dismissal imposed on him in 2006 was shockingly disproportionate.The petitioner was appointed lecturer with the department of computer science and engineering in 1999. The institute took disciplinary action against him following a complaint lodged in 2003 by a former student, who had completed her master’s course in 2000. In her complaint, the student alleged emotional and physical harassment, and claimed that the lecturer had forced a physical relationship upon her during her student years. The complaint was filed three years after she left the institute and after the teacher’s engagement to another woman.A five-member committee constituted by MNNIT expressed reservations about adjudicating allegations of rape. Subsequently, a one-man inquiry commission headed by a retired judge was appointed.The petitioner admitted to having a relationship with the complainant, but maintained it was consensual and continued after she left the institute. On the basis of the report, the institute terminated his services on Feb 28, 2006.Challenging the termination, the lecturer contended that the disciplinary proceedings were vitiated by violation of principles of natural justice, particularly denial of the right to cross-examine witnesses. MNNIT authorities argued that a teacher occupies a position of trust and authority, and any intimate relationship with a student amounts to serious misconduct.The HC observed that the relationship appeared to be consensual and was not followed by any criminal action. It noted that the complaint appeared to have been triggered by the failure of a proposed marriage between the parties due to religious differences and parental opposition.","Allahabad high court sets aside 19-year-old dismissal order of a lecturer of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Prayagraj.

Inqilab Moncho issues ultimatum, warns of tougher protests



Government promises speedy trial as arrests continue







The brother of slain youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi accused Bangladesh’s interim government, of orchestrating the killing to destabilise the country and derail the upcoming national election in February.Sharif Omar bin Hadi, speaking at a protest rally in Shahbagh on Tuesday, said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder, which took place just days after the election schedule was announced. Osman Hadi, a convenor of the political platform Inqilab Moncho, was shot on December 12 and later died of his injuries in Singapore on December 18.Addressing a “Shahidi Shopoth” programme organised by Inqilab Moncho outside the National Museum, Omar Hadi accused “a quarter within the government” of planning the killing to disrupt the electoral process. “It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” he said as quoted by The DailyStar.He said his brother had been firmly in favour of holding elections by February and had actively worked on the ground to prepare for them. “Respecting his wish, we demand that the election environment is not disturbed,” Omar Hadi said, warning that the government had so far shown “no visible progress” in delivering justice.He claimed Osman Hadi was targeted because he refused to bow to any agency or “foreign masters”. If justice was denied, Omar Hadi warned, those responsible would one day be forced to flee the country. Protesters later took an oath vowing to remain on the streets until “speedy and exemplary justice” was secured.Earlier, Inqilab Moncho’s member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber, speaking as the keynote speaker, alleged a “deep conspiracy” involving international intelligence agencies and domestic “fascist associates” aimed at undermining Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the gains of the July uprising.The platform has given the government a 30-working-day deadline to identify and arrest the killers, warning of tougher nationwide programmes if the demand is not met. While the group said it would pause formal protests on December 25, the day BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is due to return to Bangladesh, it announced wall-writing and social media campaigns across December 24 and 25, with further agitation planned from December 26.In a parallel development, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina also blamed the interim government for the deteriorating law-and-order situation, saying the killing reflected “lawlessness” under Yunus.The interim government has rejected suggestions of inaction, with Law Adviser Asif Nazrul saying the case would be tried under the Speedy Trial Tribunal Act, requiring completion within 90 days of the investigation report being filed. Home Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the case was being treated as a top priority.Joint forces comprising police, the Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh have arrested at least 10 people so far, including family members of the prime suspect, Faisal Karim Masud. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to arrest the main accused.Osman Hadi’s killing came a day after the Bangladesh Election Commission announced February 12 as the date for the next national polls. A prominent figure of the 'July Uprising' and a potential candidate for Dhaka-8, his death had fuelled major protests in Bangladesh.","Sharif Omar bin Hadi said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder.

""We Are Not Safe..."" Unnao Rape Victim’s Mother Manhandled, Protest Stopped

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation will approach the Supreme Court at the earliest to challenge the Delhi High Court order that suspended the life sentence of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and granted him bail in the 2017 Unnao rape case, officials said on Wednesday.The decision was taken after the agency examined the order passed by a division bench of the Delhi High Court.According to news agency PTI, a CBI spokesperson said it has been decided to file a special leave petition before the Supreme Court against the ruling that put Sengar’s life sentence on hold during the pendency of his appeal.Despite the bail order, Sengar will continue to remain behind bars as he is separately serving a 10-year jail term in another case linked to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father, officials clarified.Sengar had approached the Delhi High Court challenging the life sentence awarded to him by a trial court in December 2019.The appeal was strongly opposed by both the CBI and the victim’s family, who raised concerns over safety and alleged threats.The agency said it had filed timely replies and written submissions, while the survivor’s family also opposed the plea on security grounds, reported PTI.On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court suspended Sengar’s sentence, noting that he had already spent around seven years and five months in prison.The suspension will remain in force until his appeal against conviction and sentence is decided.Granting bail, the court imposed strict conditions, including a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount.The court also directed Sengar not to enter a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence in Delhi and restrained him from issuing any threats to her or her mother. Sengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping the girl in 2017, when she was a minor.The rape case and related matters were shifted from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi in August 2019 on the directions of the Supreme Court.The high court order has triggered strong reactions from the survivor, who described the suspension of Sengar’s sentence as “kaal” or death for her family, reported PTI.She said she would also approach the Supreme Court to seek justice, arguing that such decisions deepen fear among survivors of sexual violence.The survivor and her mother staged a protest in the national capital and later met Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, seeking support in their legal battle.She alleged that security for her family and legal team had already been withdrawn and claimed that the court’s decision had further heightened concerns for their safety, according to PTI.As the legal battle moves to the Supreme Court, the CBI has said it will press for the high court order to be set aside, reiterating its stand that the conviction and sentence awarded in the Unnao rape case must remain in force.",CBI to move Supreme Court against Delhi high court order in Unnao rape case.

NEW DELHI: Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region entered the third day on Wednesday, leaving two people dead, dozens injured, and prompting the state government to impose curfew-like restrictions and suspend mobile internet services in two districts.The violence erupted in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district after long simmering tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. One tribal protester died in police action, while a non tribal man was killed in a fire that gutted several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of the unrest, police said.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured after protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces. The DGP and IGP Law and Order Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those injured during the clashes.Police said protesters attempted to take control of a bridge in the area and turned violent when stopped.“Today, they tried to take over the bridge, and when we tried to stop them, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was attacked with bows and arrows,” Singh said, adding that the police have video footage and will take legal action against those responsible.The protests are rooted in opposition by the Karbi community to what they allege is illegal encroachment by non tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.The districts fall under the Karbi Anglong autonomous council, governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year demanded eviction of alleged encroachers, saying unchecked settlement threatens tribal land rights.Tensions intensified after members of the Karbi community launched a hunger strike on December 6. The situation spiralled on Tuesday after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to deteriorating health.According to police, misinformation spread that a protest leader had been arrested, triggering anger and violence.“A huge crowd has gathered here since yesterday. I met the protestors and spoke with them. Last night, their leader was taken to Guwahati for a medical check-up as the doctors thought that his health was deteriorating because of the hunger strike. Still, someone spread misinformation that he is being arrested. Violence does not get anything for anybody,” DGP Harmeet Singh told reporters.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters at Kheroni earlier, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and participate in tripartite talks on December 26 involving the state government and the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.“We assured the Karbi community that the government is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,” Pegu said, adding that discussions would address “broader issues related to existence of Karbi community.”Despite the assurance of talks, violence continued through the day, with shops and markets in Kheroni set ablaze. Police said a special investigation team has been formed and video footage is being examined to identify those involved in arson and attacks.In response to the deteriorating law and order situation, the Assam government on Tuesday ordered suspension of internet and mobile data services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts with immediate effect.“It is, however, clarified that the voice calls and the broadband connectivity based on fixed telephone lines shall remain functional during this period. Any violation of the promulgation will be punishable under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and also under the relevant provision of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” said Biswajit Pegu, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department.The government said district magistrates warned that social media could be used to spread inflammatory messages and rumours, further aggravating tensions.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was closely monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, about 250 km east of Guwahati.“It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest,” Sarma said in a post on X, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and assuring all possible support.Authorities said efforts are under way to restore calm, urging community leaders to restrain youths and prevent further violence ahead of the scheduled talks later this week.","Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region enter third day.

Assam’s Karbi Anglong Gripped By Violence, Internet Suspended As Anger Over ‘Encroachers’ Explodes

NEW DELHI: Assam DGP Harmeet Singh on Wednesday confirmed that the Army has been deployed to restore law and order in violence-hit West Karbi Anglong, news agency PTI reported.The region has now entered its third day of violent protests over alleged illegal settlement by non-tribals in the constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill area. The clashes have left two people dead and dozens injured. In response, the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led government has imposed curfew-like restrictions and suspended mobile internet services in two districts to control the situation.Assam CM Himanta said the Karbi people's demand to evict alleged Hindi-speaking encroachers from grazing lands cannot be acted upon immediately, as the matter is currently under a stay order issued by the Gauhati high court.The violence in West Karbi Anglong and the neighbouring Karbi Anglong district began after long-standing tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. Police said one tribal protester died during police action, while a non-tribal man was killed in a fire that destroyed several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has now become the centre of the unrest.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said that 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured when protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces.Both the DGP and IGP (Law and Order) Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those hurt.

The petitioner failed to provide specifics of affected families or prisoners, the nature of cases, or any transfer orders, the court noted.In her petition, the PDP president had also sought an “access protocol” for weekly in-person family interviews and unrestricted privileged lawyer-client meetings, monitoring by legal services authorities, besides a proposed two-member oversight committee.The bench held that the petition, “lacking material documents and grounded in ambiguity,” sought to invoke writ jurisdiction on incomplete and unsubstantiated facts “clearly unveiling its political undercurrents”.The bench observed that the PIL appeared to have been initiated “for the explicit purpose of garnering political advantage,” stressing that PIL cannot be used to advance partisan agendas or convert the court into a political platform.“Since none of the allegedly affected undertrials had approached the court even through institutional mechanisms, the bench held that Mufti, as a political leader, lacked standing to espouse their cause,” the bench noted.The court held that a purely individual grievance concerning a prisoner’s rights cannot ordinarily be the subject of PIL.",The high court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh dismissed a PIL filed by former J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti.

GUWAHATI: Two persons died, one in clashes with police and the other in a fire, as hundreds of protesters armed with crude bombs, bows and arrows and stones battled cops over alleged encroachment by illegal non-tribal settlers in forest areas in West Karbi Anglong district on Tuesday.Assam Police DGP Harmeet Singh, IGP (law and order) Akhilesh Kumar Singh, and 48 police personnel sustained injuries.Police sources said a tribal man died in police action against protesters and a non-tribal man died in a fire at the Kheroni main market.By late afternoon, the administration suspended mobile internet services in both West Karbi Anglong and Karbi Anglong districts indefinitely to “maintain public peace and tranquillity and to prevent any deterioration of the present situation”. Voice calls and broadband services via fixed lines, however, remained unaffected.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote on ‘X’: “I am closely monitoring the situation in West Karbi Anglong. It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest. Additional security forces will be deployed in Kherani tomorrow to maintain peace. We are in constant touch with all concerned to restore normalcy and resolve issues through dialogue.My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. The govt will stand with all affected families and provide all necessary support. ”DGP Singh said, “It was a proper attack by protestors. I was attacked with bows and arrows, which had to be blocked with shields. I was also hit by stones,” he said.Singh added that protestors used gas cylinders to set shops and markets ablaze, even throwing one cylinder at security forces. “Govt is ready to talk. A date has been set for a tripartite talk over their demands. Violence does not achieve anything. We have all the videos and faces. Legal action will follow. My appeal to society is to explain to these youths that violence will not help. They are misguided and being misused,” he said.Appealing for unity, Singh said, “Nepal was running on tourism. Look at Nepal, what has happened there. Assam and the country are on the path to progress. My request is that we work together.”The two hill districts are governed by the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Residents have long protested encroachment on professional grazing reserve (PGR) and village grazing reserve (VGR) lands, demanding evictions for over a year. Since Dec 6, many have been on a hunger strike.On Tuesday, tensions continued as shops and markets in Kheroni — now the epicentre of the crisis — were torched.Earlier in the day, cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu met agitators at violence-hit Kheroni. He said the protesters agreed to halt their hunger strike and join tripartite talks with the state govt and KAAC scheduled for Dec 26.Pegu said, “The Karbi community has been on hunger strike since Dec 6 with demands including eviction from PGR and VGR lands. An unwanted situation emerged when police shifted a few hunger-striking agitators to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital after their health deteriorated. The group initially misunderstood this, leading to unrest. Today, we assured the Karbi community that the govt is serious about land rights and other tribal issues. ”Though land issues fall under KAAC’s jurisdiction, Pegu said the state govt would hold tripartite talks involving KAAC representatives to address the “greater and broader issues related to the existence of the Karbi community”.",Police sources said a tribal man died in police action against protesters and a non-tribal man in a fire at the Kheroni main market.

Protesters target Bangladeshi media outlets

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor. Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12. India has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126132775,imgsize-2165803,width-400,resizemode-4/bangladesh-unrest.jpg"

Until Dec 19, along with the incumbent Chief Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Justice R Suresh Kumar, Justice J Nisha Banu was also part of the collegium as she was the second seniormost puisne judge in Madras high court.Though she was transferred to Kerala high court through a notification dated Oct 14, she continued to be a member of the Madras high court collegium since she did not assume charge in the transferee court until Dec 19, he said.While so, the recommendation of 13 lawyers was made by a collegium comprising the Chief Justice, Justice R Suresh Kumar and Justice M S Ramesh, excluding Justice Nisha Banu, which is fundamentally flawed, he said. The petitioner added that the chief justice should not have proceeded with the recommendation by including Justice Ramesh, as Justice Nisha Banu had not joined Kerala high court until Dec 19.A fresh notification was issued instructing Justice Nisha Banu to join Kerala HC by Dec 20.This proves that Justice Nisha Banu continued as the second seniormost puisne judge of Madras HC when the recommendations were made without including her in the collegium, the petitioner said. “The process of judicial appointments to a superior court is not a prerogative of a single individual. Instead, it is a collaborative and participatory process involving all collegium members,” he said.Therefore, the exclusion of Justice Nisha Banu from the collegium that made the recommendation is contrary to law and established procedures. He further alleged that the entire list of advocates recommended is backed by strong political interference.He wanted the court to pass an interim order restraining the central govt from accepting the recommendation and direct the registrar (judicial) of the high court to reconsider the recommendations.","A public interest writ petition has been filed questioning the legality and constitutionality of the collegium which shortlisted and made the recommendations.

Who is Tarique Rahman

Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman and a leading figure in opposition politics is scheduled to land in Dhaka on Thursday, ending more than 17 years of self-exile in the UK. His return ends a prolonged period abroad that began in 2008, when he left Bangladesh for medical treatment amid heightened legal and political pressures at home.His return comes at a time when the country has been marred by a series of violent incidents, weeks after the announcement of parliamentary elections slated for February 12.Rahman, the elder son of former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, is widely seen as the party’s principal face ahead of the polls, particularly as Zia remains unwell.Since the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has witnessed recurring spells of violence. The recent killing of youth leader and key figure in Hasina’s ouster, Osman Hadi, has reignited tensions, with Hadi’s brother alleging that the murder was aimed at “sabotaging polls”.Rahman’s homecoming has been facilitated by the interim government. Earlier this month, foreign advisor Md Touhid Hossain said the government could issue a “one-time” travel pass within a day if Rahman wished to return.Chief advisor Muhammad Yunus also discussed Rahman’s return at a recent meeting, according to officials.BNP leaders said Rahman will complete formalities to become a registered voter on December 27, a step that would allow him to play a direct role in electoral politics.Rahman earlier told BBC Bangla, “For some reasonable reasons my return has not happened... but the time has come, and I will return soon… I am running in the election [as well].”Tarique Rahman, 58, is the elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and acting chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He has lived in self-exile in London since 2008 after leaving Bangladesh amid multiple criminal convictions, including money laundering and charges linked to an alleged plot to assassinate then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.Over the past year, Bangladesh’s higher courts have acquitted him in all major cases, including the 2004 grenade attack and the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case, clearing legal hurdles to his political return. Widely regarded as the BNP’s de facto leader, Rahman has now announced plans to return and contest the February 2026 general elections.According to BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed, senior party leaders will receive Rahman at the airport before he proceeds to a reception venue on the July Expressway, also known as the 300 Feet Road, where he is expected to address the nation.He will then visit Khaleda Zia at the hospital and return to his residence in Gulshan-2, Ahmed said. Details of Rahman’s first three days back were outlined by Ahmed at a press conference on Wednesday, as reported by Prothom Alo.On Friday, December 26, Rahman is slated to visit the grave of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, followed by a visit to the National Martyrs’ Monument in Savar.On Saturday, December 27, he is expected to complete national identity card procedures to become a voter, visit the grave of martyred Osman Hadi at Dhaka University, and meet those injured in the July mass uprising at the National Orthopaedic Hospital in Shyamoli, Prothom Alo reported.Bangladesh over the last three decades has alternated power between two rivals, now-ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Rahman’s mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia.Zia was the first female prime minister of Bangladesh and served from 1991 to 1995, and again from 2001 to 2006. Her tenure remains fresh in public memory, particularly among political factions that ousted Hasina on allegations of corruption. Her regime also saw allegations of atrocities and discrimination against minorities. In 2018, Zia was sentenced to five years in prison on graft charges.Bangladesh’s political order has been reshaped following the violent 2024 uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s ouster and the disbanding of her Awami League by the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus.With the Awami League barred from elections, traditional alliances have fractured, including the long-standing BNP–Jamaat partnership. The emergence of the student-led National Citizen Party, born out of the July protests and now registered with the Election Commission, has added further uncertainty to an already fluid electoral landscape.With Khaleda Zia, 80, battling health issues, the BNP sees Tarique Rahman as its most viable leader going into the first election in nearly two decades without the Awami League. His decision to contest signals an effort to consolidate party unity, reclaim the Zia family’s political legacy, and project the BNP as the principal governing alternative.Political observers view the BNP as a frontrunner, and Rahman is being tipped as a possible prime ministerial candidate if the party secures a majority.India-Bangladesh relations have sharply deteriorated since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster and her political asylum in India, where she continues to reside despite arrest warrants and extradition requests from Dhaka.The BNP has criticised New Delhi for sheltering Hasina, with Rahman saying India risks alienating the Bangladeshi public by doing so. A BNP return to power could further strain ties, given the party’s historically closer relations with Pakistan, in contrast to Hasina’s pro-India stance that included cooperation against insurgent and extremist networks.As the BNP regains political prominence, it faces growing challenges from rising mob violence and the resurgence of Islamist groups advocating stricter religious norms. Party leaders have warned against attempts to impose Shariah law and curtail women’s freedoms, cautioning that extremist forces are seeking to replace liberal democratic politics.Recent attacks on religious sites and political offices, along with survey data showing widespread public concern over mob violence, underline the risks confronting the BNP as it prepares for elections.The political stakes are high. Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League has been barred from contesting the upcoming elections, leaving the BNP as a frontrunner. The BNP-led alliance is set to face a coalition headed by Jamaat-e-Islami.Rahman and the BNP have previously pressed the interim administration for early elections and, in May, questioned Yunus’ mandate to take long-term foreign policy decisions, arguing that such authority rests with an elected government.","Tarique Rahman, 58, is the elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and acting chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

Hamas Refuses To End Gaza Fight? Netanyahu Gets Chilling Warning | ‘3rd INTIFADA Would Break Out’





BETHLEHEM: Thousands of people flocked to Bethlehem’s Manger Square on Christmas Eve as families heralded a much-needed boost of holiday spirit. The giant Christmas tree that was absent during the Israel-Hamas war returned Wednesday, overlooking a parade of scouts playing songs on bagpipes.The city where Christians believe Jesus was born cancelled Christmas celebrations for the past two years. Manger Square had instead featured a nativity scene of baby Jesus surrounded by rubble and barbed wire in homage to the situation in Gaza. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, top Catholic leader in the Holy Land, kicked off this year’s celebrations during the traditional procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, calling for “a Christmas full of light”.Arriving in Manger Square, Pizzaballa said he came bearing greetings from Gaza’s tiny Christian community, where he held a pre-Christmas Mass on Sunday. Among the devastation, he saw a desire to rebuild.“We, all together, we decide to be the light, and the light of Bethlehem is the light of the world,” he told thousands of people, Christian and Muslim.Despite the holiday cheer, the impact of the war in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is acute, especially in Bethlehem, where around 80% of the Muslim-majority city’s residents depend upon tourism-related businesses.The vast majority of people celebrating were residents, with a handful of foreigners. Some residents said they are starting to see signs of change as tourism slowly returns. “Today is a day of joy, a day of hope, beginning of the return of normal life here,” said Bethlehem resident Georgette Jackaman, a tour guide who has not worked in more than two years.A visitor from France, Mona Riewer, said “I came because I wanted to better understand what people in Palestine are going through, and you can sense people have been through a very hard time.” Fadi Zoughbi, who previously worked overseeing logistics for tour groups, said his children were ecstatic to see marching bands streaming through the streets.Irene Kirmiz, who grew up in Bethlehem and now lives in Ramallah, said the scout parade is among her favourite Christmas traditions. Her daughter, 15, plays the tenor drum with the Ramallah scouts. Her family had to wake up at 5am to arrive in time for the parade and waited upwards of three hours at Israeli checkpoints. “It’s very emotional seeing people trying to bounce back, trying to celebrate peace and love.”","Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, top Catholic leader in the Holy Land, kicked off this year’s celebrations during the traditional procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.

Osman Hadi's Brother Accuses Yunus Regime Of Murder Plot To Defer Bangladesh Polls Scheduled in Feb





DHAKA: Tarique Rahman, former PM Khaleda Zia’s son and BNP’s heir apparent, returns to Bangladesh Thursday along with his family, ending over 17 years of self-exile. On the eve of his return, the country’s largest political party described the moment as “both politically significant and emotionally charged. ”His return, along with wife Zubaida and daughter Zaima, comes less than two months before the parliamentary elections and BNP sources said his presence in campaigns as its star leader will help boost its prospects and its workers’ morale.BNP is facing the challenge of growing popularity of the coalition led by the country’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, especially among the youth. To mark his return, BNP has organised a reception in the outskirts of Dhaka, for which the party expects thousands to gather.Rahman was detained by the 2007-2008 military-backed caretaker govt, and he went to Britain after the regime released him and has been living in London since then. He had faced multiple criminal convictions, including a case related to a plot to assassinate Hasina. He was, however, acquitted of all charges after Hasina’s removal.Though he has been leading the party from abroad, his return now comes as he prepares to take a more direct role in party affairs, sources said.","Tarique Rahman, former PM Khaleda Zia’s son, returns to Bangladesh along with his family, ending over 17 years of self-exile.

Putin Smirks As Zelensky Blinks, Offers Concessions To Moscow In New 20-Point Peace Plan





KYIV: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told reporters on Tuesday that he was ready to pull his troops back from areas of the eastern Donetsk region still under Kyiv’s control and turn them into a demilitarized zone as part of a possible peace deal with Moscow.The offer was the closest Zelensky has come to addressing the thorny territorial disputes in Donetsk that have repeatedly derailed peace talks, signalling his willingness to compromise after weeks of US-mediated negotiations.But the proposal also hinted at the significant gaps that remain between Ukraine and Russia. Zelensky’s offer of a demilitarized zone came with a condition: Russia would have to pull its forces from an equivalent stretch of land in Donetsk. So far, the Kremlin has given no indication that it is willing to accept anything less than full control over the region.The proposal forms part of a revised 20-point peace plan that was drawn up by Ukraine and the US in the past few weeks and that Zelensky presented to reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday. The blueprint covers a broad range of issues, from potential territorial arrangements to the security guarantees Ukraine wants to prevent future Russian aggression, as well as plans to rebuild the war-ravaged nation.Zelensky portrayed the plan as Ukraine’s best effort to end the war and said it was now up to Russia to decide how to respond.The Ukrainian leader said the various points in the plan “largely reflect the joint Ukrainian American position.” But Ukraine and Washington did not reach an agreement on two sticking points: the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in Donetsk and control of a major nuclear plant currently occupied by Russia. On the second point, Ukraine offered to manage the plant jointly with the US as a form of compromise.Ukraine’s proposed concessions, even if accepted in full by the US, are likely to be rejected by Moscow. The Kremlin has insisted that its primary goal is a full military takeover of Donetsk and has dismissed any notion of returning the nuclear plant to Ukrainian control.The Kremlin said President Putin had been briefed about the negotiations. “We aim to formulate our future stance and resume our contacts shortly,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Zelensky voiced cautious optimism that Moscow would not openly rebuff the new proposal for fear of angering President Trump.",Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky offered to pull his troops back from areas of the eastern Donetsk region still under Kyiv’s control as part of a possible peace deal with Moscow.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"Charlie Kirk's KILLER In Court; Tyler Robinson Defiant, Shows No Remorse | Dramatic Scenes On Cam





Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.

The US Justice Department released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein, marking the largest disclosure yet in the long-running investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender. The files also contained many of mentions of US President Donald Trump, although it includes an email from a prosecutor pointing out the flights that Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.The Department of Justice said that some material includes “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump that were submitted to the FBI shortly before the 2020 election. The department said those allegations were unfounded and false, but the records were being made public in the interests of legal transparency, with protections in place for Epstein’s victims.Among nearly 30,000 pages of material is now available on the official Justice Department website.An FBI intake report dated October 27, 2020, records a tip from a former limousine driver. According to that report, the driver described a disturbing phone conversation he claimed he overheard in 1995 involving Trump and Epstein.The driver’s account says the woman later told him she had contacted police about what had occurred, and was then found dead in January 2000 by suicide.The details in the file are heavily redacted, and the authorities have made little to no determination about the allegations’ credibility.In an accompanying statement on X on Tuesday, DOJ addressed the claims. It said some documents contain “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.""The authotrity described the allegations as lacking any credible basis. “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the department said.The DOJ reitarated its commitment to transparency and the legal requirement to release the records, but also said that the inclusion of such claims in the files does not make them factual.Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In public statements this week, the MAGA chief called the focus on the Epstein case as a distraction by Democrats, asserting that he “cut ties” with Epstein long before the pedophile's arrest in 2019.The release covers a range of material, not just the unverified rape allegation. Internal emails in the files show Trump was recorded as having travelled on Epstein’s private jet in the 1990s more times than previously known — at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996.Trump’s association with Epstein in the 1990s is well documented, but inclusion in flight logs or social records is not itself an accusation of illegal behaviour.DOJ is constantly being pressured by Democrats for not releasing the full bulk of files. Supporters of the Transparency Act say the public has a right to see government records, even if they contain unverified claims.The latest release follows criticism of an earlier batch of Epstein records, some of which were temporarily removed from the DOJ’s online portal amid concerns about protecting victims’ identities. Authorities later restored those files after determining no victims were shown in the disputed photos.","Department of Justice released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein.

The US Department of Justice on Tuesday said that it has uncovered over a million additional documents “potentially related” to the Jeffrey Epstein case.In a social media post on X, the Department of Justice said that finishing the release of all of Epstein’s files could take a “few more weeks.”“The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The DOJ has received these documents from SDNY and the FBI to review them for release, in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, existing statutes, and judicial orders,” the DOJ said.“We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the massive volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks. The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump’s direction to release the files,” it added.This comes days after the DOJ released 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, while noting that some of these documents contain “untrue” claims made against President Donald Trump.In an X post, the DOJ claimed that the documents against Donald Trump are “false” and would have been “weaponised” against him.“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims,” the DOJ wrote on X.A 2021 subpoena to the Mar-a-Lago Club, founded by Trump in 1995, is also among the documents, as reported by CNN. The subpoena relates to a probe into Epstein’s former girlfriend and convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell The documents also include a letter signed by “J Epstein,” which was sent to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar in the same month Epstein died by suicide in 2019. The letter, as reported by CNN, makes references to Trump without explicitly naming him. The letter contains the phrase “our president.”However, the DOJ said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has confirmed that the letter is fake. The DOJ noted that the writing in the letter does not appear to match Epstein’s, and the letter was postmarked three days after his death.The US passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act last month, prompting the DOJ to release documents related to Epstein, who was charged as a sex offender.Newly released documents tied to Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson, musician Mick Jagger, and former US President Bill Clinton.The DOJ has released thousands of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, but a substantial number of documents remain unpublished.Among the newly released documents is a grand jury interview with an unnamed FBI agent from May 2007. The agent described an allegation that Epstein recruited a 15-year-old girl to give him a topless massage.The agent said a witness had recruited other girls from among their peer group, adding: “Epstein liked girls like her, which is thin and blonde and attractive,” as quoted by The Independent.Another witness quoted in the files described Epstein as selective and highly focused on the age of the girls he allowed to work for him, adding that Epstein rejected some girls he “didn’t really like” and once dismissed a potential masseur as “too old” at 23.","The US Department of Justice on Tuesday said that it has uncovered over a million additional documents “potentially related” to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Kash Patel-Led FBI Hands Over 1 MILLION More Files To Trump DOJ





In academia, loyalty is usually reserved for ideas, not indicted billionaires. But newly surfaced emails suggest a UCLA neuroscience professor once pledged allegiance to Jeffrey Epstein — even after learning the disgraced financier was preparing to plead guilty to soliciting a minor. Calling themselves “boys from The Bronx,” the professor framed friendship as thicker than scandal, law enforcement or, it seems, common sense.Newly unearthed emails showed that Professor Mark Tramo of UCLA pledged loyalty to Jeffrey Epstein after learning he planned to plead guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. The message, sent after Tramo read media reports of the impending plea, referred to them as “boys from The Bronx”, emphasising their bond, New York Post reported.“I read the newspapers this morning. … Please remind him that boys from The Bronx (even if they end up at Harvard) have long memories, know all about cops, and stay true to their friends through thick and thin (no less peccadilloes),” Tramo wrote.Epstein served a 13-month sentence for the solicitation charges. He was also charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors in July 2019 and died in jail two months later.In a statement to the Harvard Crimson, Tramo denied knowing the full extent of Epstein’s conduct in 2006–2007, saying he had been “duped to believe” the offences were minor. He added, “I never visited Epstein’s island, never flew on his planes, and never saw him with young girls.”In a 2018 email, Tramo offered to analyse Kanye West’s meeting with President Trump for Epstein “given your interest in creativity”. Records suggest the Institute for Music and Brain Science, founded by Tramo, received grants from the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation between 2010 and 2012. A UCLA spokesperson told the Daily Bruin the university had no records of gifts from that foundation.Student reactions were mixed. “You can’t say that you didn’t know what was going on if then you’re still contacting him past his initial arrest,” one student said on condition of anonymity. Grace Wang, who took Tramo’s class in fall 2025, said the emails did not indicate a close connection to Epstein, adding that the professor seemed inclined to email anyone “of even remote interest to him.”The trove of documents was released by the Department of Justice under a bipartisan mandate and includes FBI files, court records and photographs, though large sections remain heavily redacted to protect victims. In a letter to lawmakers, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said teams of attorneys had reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of material to determine what could legally be disclosed. More Epstein-related material is expected in the coming weeks.","Newly unearthed emails showed Professor Mark Tramo of UCLA pledged loyalty to Jeffrey Epstein after learning he planned to plead guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Why Nick Fuentes is targeting Usha Vance and Vivek Ramaswamy





Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna came out in support of Vivek Ramaswamy and Usha Vance and called out Nick Fuentes' dangerous anti-Indian rhetoric, where he is attacking Vivek Ramaswamy to target Vice President JD Vance.""Nick, your campaigning against @VivekGRamaswamy because he is Hindu & of Indian heritage to send a message to @JDVance in 28 is chilling. I reject your bigotry against Vivek & Usha Vance. Many Hindu Americans, including my family, love celebrating Christmas. Merry Christmas,"" Ro Khanna said. Nick Fuentes in his latest hate speech said if Ramaswmay becomes the Governor, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Governor house to which Ro Khanna objected and said many Hindu Americans do celebrate Christmas.Nick Fuentes again called Vivek Ramaswamy an 'anchor baby' and said he should not become the Ohio Governor. He said it is the only election that Fuentes cares about because Ramaswamy is not even a Christian.Nick Fuentes recently hurled racial abuse at Second Lady Usha Vance because of her Indian origin. Vivek Ramaswamy objected to it and said Nick Fuentes does not represent America.

By defeating Ramaswamy in 2026, the message will be delivered to JD Vance in 2028, Fuentes elaborated.",Nick Fuentes again called Vivek Ramaswamy an 'anchor baby' and said he should not become the Ohio Governor.

Epstein In Senate: Kash Patel Ambushes Massie; 'You Want Names, You Want Names?' | FULL EXCHANGE





When the Epstein files hit X, the blowback hit harder. Now, in an unusual damage-control move, the White House has taken charge of the Justice Department’s social media messaging, trying to steady the narrative after a chaotic release, sudden deletions, and a wave of conspiracy theories rattled the Trump administration.According to Axios, the department of justice (DOJ), under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has been working through a reported trove of over 1.45 million records to meet the requirements of the Epstein Transparency Act, personally signed by President Trump. Faced with criticism, White House officials assumed control of the account to sharpen messaging and steer away from the negative public reaction.One day after posting the first batch of documents, the DOJ reclaimed 13 files without explanation. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked Bondi on X, “What else is being covered up?” Bondi is facing calls for impeachment and contempt of Congress over her handling of the files.One retracted file featured a photograph of Trump, 79, found in a drawer at an Epstein property. The DOJ said it removed the image out of concern for victims before reinstating it following further review.An unnamed official told Axios that a second batch of files - in which the president features more prominently - was released prematurely owing to an internal error.Officials close to the administration voiced frustration: “It’s a combination of extreme frustration at everything: at what Congress did, at our response to it, and a concern that it won’t go away.”Bondi’s department was also criticised for not releasing all records by the Friday deadline, as required by law. More than 200 staff worked through the backlog, but puzzling redactions have undermined the pledge of full transparency.In one case, the publicly available addresses of the United States Attorney’s Office and the New Mexico Department of Justice were removed from a 2020 letter about the seizure of an Epstein property. “These redactions are so arbitrary, it destroys the credibility of the entire exercise,” journalist Michael Tracey wrote on X. “They’re redacting completely banal documents that have already been in the public domain for years!”A reporter from the Miami Herald noticed another 2008 document that was unjustifiably redacted under the Transparency Act.Critics have also pointed to the quality of the documents released. After issuing 30,000 new investigative records on Tuesday, the DOJ included an alleged letter from Epstein to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar in which “our president” liked “nubile” girls. The letter was postmarked after Epstein’s death and passed through a mail room that did not handle correspondence from Epstein’s New York jail, and it was later determined to be a fake. The department released it anyway in the interest of “transparency.”The DOJ later posted on X, “The FBI has confirmed this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar is FAKE,” prompting concerns over the release of disinformation.On Tuesday, another questionable document slipped through vetting even as the department warned some records could be “untrue and sensationalist” but insisted on issuing them for “transparency.”Although no “smoking gun” has been found linking President Trump to wrongdoing, he remains rattled by mentions of his name in the files. “The minute he thinks it’s unfair to him and it’s a personal attack, he just goes into fight mode,” an insider told Axios in November.Around 700,000 files still await review, prolonging the scrutiny of the Trump administration. “This will end soon,” one official said. “The conspiracy theories won’t.”","The White House has taken charge of the Justice Department’s social media messaging, trying to steady the narrative after a chaotic release, sudden deletions, and a wave of conspiracy theories.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday said that Pakistan should not oppose attacks by India if the country itself was attacking Afghanistan.Speaking to journalists in Rehman said, “If you justify attacking Afghanistan by claiming you are targeting your enemy there, then why do you object when India targets its enemy in Bahawalpur and Murid (inside Pakistan)?”He further warned that continued tensions between the two neighbours would only destabilise the region and said dialogue and political engagement were the only lasting solutions.The JUI-F chief also slammed Pakistan's army saying political power belonged to the people and not the armed forces, reported local news paper The Express Tribune. ""Political strength is not the right of defence institutions; it belongs to the people and politicians,"" Rehman said.Rehman further said national progress depended on constitutional supremacy, not the dominance of one institution over others. The senior cleric-politician also opposed sending Pakistani troops to Palestine.On Afghanistan, Fazlur Rehman noted that no Afghan government, from the time of King Zahir Shah to Ashraf Ghani, had been friendly towards Pakistan, and asked whether this pointed to failures in Pakistan’s own policy.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.
