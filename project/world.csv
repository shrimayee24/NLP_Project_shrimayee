"After vehicle breakdown, guide abandons Ranthambore tourists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-vehicle-breakdown-guide-abandons-ranthambore-tourists/articleshow/123376707.cms,"Jaipur: The open-top safari truck coughed, rattled, stopped. Twenty tourists sat trapped in Ranthambore's Zone-6 - a 25sqkm territory locals call ""three-tiger country"". Time: 6pm. Darkness set in and the forest closed in. Panic spread. Parents whispered words of comfort to shush their crying children.For an hour and 45 minutes Saturday evening, the group remained stranded. Among those stuck was a seven-month-old child. Their guide allegedly deserted them, taking a lift out with another vehicle. By 7pm, no relief had come.With no mobile network to summon help, tourist Mohit hailed another vehicle returning from a trip. There's room for only one. He reached the main gate and begged for help. At the chowki, staff told him it wasn't their responsibility.A Canter driver allegedly demanded full payment before agreeing to assist.Rescue finally arrived around 7.45pm. The replacement Canter had no working headlights. The driver steered through the jungle with a torch. Children cried as the forest went pitch black. An audio recording of a woman tourist's call, made after she reached safety, recounted the ordeal.""Fortunately, no wild animal appeared,"" she said. Ranthambore is home to 70 tigers and about 130 leopards.The broken Canter may have spared its passengers a brush with the wild - but it left the national park's safari system fully exposed.A senior official said Sunday the truck broke down during the evening safari. Another Canter, meant to be on standby at the chowki, was absent. A third Canter, which had already returned, was instructed to bring the marooned group but failed to follow orders. Forest department banned all three Canter drivers and the accompanying guide until further orders. An inquiry has been ordered, with the assistant conservator of forests (tourism) directed to submit a report in three days.The department also reviewed the age and condition of safari vehicles. Ranthambore currently has 556 registered vehicles for tourism: 269 Gypsies and 287 Canters. Authorised vehicles are either locally owned and registered with the forest department or department-owned, with private operators managing bookings.Hoteliers and conservation stakeholders warned that many Canters are in rundown condition.""Some owners avoid spending on maintenance... expecting the vehicles will be phased out,"" a tour operator said Monday. ""A dedicated rescue vehicle must always be stationed.""Tourists came to see the wild, but none of Ranthambore's tigers showed up. Instead, they saw the cracks in the system - in full, frightening darkness.","Twenty tourists sat trapped in Ranthambore's Zone-6 - a 25sqkm territory locals call ""three-tiger country"" For an hour and 45 minutes Saturday evening, the group remained stranded.

Husband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/husband-taking-part-in-selection-of-amus-1st-woman-vc-not-proper-sc/articleshow/123375855.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday made adverse comments on the selection process that led to the appointment of Naima Khatoon as the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), saying the participation of her husband Mohd Gulrez, the officiating vice-chancellor, in the process was not proper.A bench of CJI Bhushan R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said, ""Certainly, the husband's participation in the selection process is not proper when his wife is a candidate. He should have recused and made his deputy participate in it. The selection process should not only be fair but also appear to be fair"".The remarks came on appeals filed against a judgment of Allahabad HC, which too had disapproved of the participation of Khatoon's husband in the selection process, but upheld her selection by the President, who is the visitor of the university, as the vice-chancellor of AMU.Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal explained how voting in the executive council was tailored to insert Khatoon's name into the panel of five names - Faizan Mustafa, Qayyum Husain, Muzaffar Uruj Rabbani and Furqan Qamar were the other candidates - for the purpose. When these names were placed before the AMU Court (Senate), Rabbani got 61 votes, Mustafa, 50 votes, and Khatoon, 50 votes. These three names were sent to the President of India, who chose Khatoon as VC, and she was appointed to the post in Apr last year.Despite the CJI's adverse comments, the court adjourned the hearing as Justice Chandran recused himself, on the ground that as chancellor he had recommended the appointment of Faizan Mustafa as the VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Chandran need not recuse himself as the parties had full faith in him. He held that Gulrez's participation in the selection process did not affect the sanctity of Prof Khatoon's appointment as AMU VC as her name was included in the panel of three names by the AMU Court.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench that the selection process had followed the rules and regulations scrupulously and that the high court, after examining the allegations, had upheld her appointment as the AMU vice-chancellor.Sibal said he had no issues with the Visitor's choice, but if the allegations of manipulation were examined and found true, then Khatoon's name would not have figured on the list of five names forwarded to the AMU court by the executive council.",Naima Khatoon is the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University.

Intent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intent-to-drive-a-person-to-death-must-for-abetment-conviction-sc/articleshow/123375600.cms,"New DELHI: A person cannot be accused of abetment of suicide if there is no conscious deliberate intention on their part to drive another person to suicidal death, no matter how harsh or severe the harassment they meted out, the Supreme Court said on Monday while upholding Bombay high court's decision to quash the abetment of suicide case over the death by suicide of former MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli constituency Mohan Delkar.Delkar, a seven-time MP, died by suicide on Feb 22, 2021, leaving behind a suicide note which named persons, both in the administration and police, who he said had conspired to defame, degrade and demean him, to end his political career and ruin his social standing.But a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said the court could not place absolute reliance on the suicide note to initiate the proceedings in absence of any other evidence. The court noted that police had still not grasped what constitutes abetment of suicide despite a slew of SC verdicts and ""FIRs are registered, investigation carried out and for reason of abject ignorance or on tainted instigation or at times deliberate design, the alleged perpetrator is even taken into custody without examining the existence of mens rea (intention of accused)"".Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Chandran said that merely because the victim was continuously harassed and at one point, they succumbed to the extreme act of taking their life cannot by itself result in finding positive instigation that constitutes abetment and mens rea cannot be gleaned merely by what goes on in the mind of the victim.""True, a person unable to bear the pressure or withstand a humiliation or unable to oppose, may succumb to the extreme act of ending his own life, in desperation; but that would not necessarily mean that the alleged perpetrator had an intention to lead the victim to eventual death by his own or her own hands,"" the bench said.It said many people stand up, some fight back, a few run away in the face of adversity and certain people crumble and, at times, take the extreme step of suicide. ""To put the blame on the pressure imposed and the person responsible for it, at all times, without something more to clearly discern an intention, would not be the proper application of the penal provisions under Section 306 (abetment),"" the court said.""The victim may have felt that there was no alternative or option, but to take his life, because of what another person did or said; which cannot lead to a finding of mens rea and resultant abetment on that other person. What constitutes mens rea is the intention and purpose of the alleged perpetrator as discernible from the conscious acts or words and the attendant circumstances, which in all probability could lead to such an end. The real intention of the accused and whether he intended by his action to at least possibly drive the victim to suicide, is the sure test. Did the thought of goading the victim to suicide occur in the mind of the accused or whether it can be inferred from the facts and circumstances arising in the case, as the true test of mens rea would depend on the facts of each case,"" it said.","Mohan Delkar, a seven-time MP, died by suicide on Feb 22, 2021.

Back then, Kamala Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco and Gavin Newsom was its mayor.

Aaron Rodgers takes aim at Donald Trump’s pandemic leadership

Donald Trump keeps fueling NFL debates



Aaron Rodgers has never shied away from mixing football with controversy, and his sharpest comments often extend beyond the gridiron. During a 2024 appearance on the Look Into It podcast, the four-time MVP quarterback revisited Donald Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, reigniting debate about the intersection of politics and sports.Aaron Rodgers, who drew widespread scrutiny for questioning vaccine mandates and even flirted with politics himself as a rumored running mate for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., argued that Donald Trump failed his own “drain the swamp” promise. His biggest criticism focused on Donald Trump’s decision to keep Dr. Anthony Fauci in charge.“Trump, OK, Trump’s an outsider, all the rhetoric, we’re going to drain a swamp and go after the corruption. And I don’t think a lot happened,” Rodgers said. “What I fault him for is Tony Fauci … not only did Trump push the vaccine, Operation Warp Speed, or whatever the [heck] it was, but he let Fauci stay in charge and shut the country down.”The president, however, hasn’t stayed out of NFL storylines himself. Amid Pittsburgh’s quarterback shuffle, Donald Trump unexpectedly endorsed Mason Rudolph, praising his arm and charisma while predicting he could become “the guy” for the Steelers.Trump’s second term has also divided locker rooms. The Philadelphia Eagles split over attending the White House after their Super Bowl LIX win, while Saquon Barkley drew online fire for golfing with Trump.

A fake Aadhaar card was used to show her age as 19 years.The girl's missed call to her grandmother eventually led to her rescue. Police have arrested three men in connection with the case.Police sources said the force got a complaint about a missing girl on July 22. Despite continuous effort by the family and the police, she could not be traced at first. A case was registered under Section 137 (kidnapping) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).""While we were searching for the girl, her family informed us that they had received a missed call from an unknown number. When they called back, a woman answered and said her daughter-in-law might have made the call, then abruptly disconnected it.The number provided by the family had one incorrect digit, and when a police team followed that lead to Mathura, it turned out to be false, a police source said. Later, after obtaining the correct phone number, the team traced the location to Shamli and rescued the girl from a home.Police later learned that the girl had left her home and taken a bus to a railway station and randomly boarded a train that led her to Meerut.While she was wandering in the station, she encountered a 20-year-old man, who promised to help her settle down. However, it was a trap. The man from Hapur, along with a 55-year-old associate from Meerut, took the girl to Shamli, where they forced her to marry a 40-year-old man on July 24 in exchange for Rs 15,000-20,000. They made a fake Aadhaar card to falsify her age as 19 years.Four days after the forced marriage, the girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by the 40-year-old man at his residence. Police are now investigating whether other minor girls — often from impoverished backgrounds — were similarly trafficked and forcibly married to older men.The duo, and the man who married the girl, have been booked under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including charges of human trafficking , exploitation of a trafficked person, and forgery of official documents.Additionally, provisions under Sections 6 and 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as well as Sections 9 and 10 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, have been invoked against the trio.The arrests were carried out by a team from the Bharat Nagar police station.

Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Lieutenant General Vinod G Khandare (retired), who was the principal advisor to the Ministry of Defence during Operation Sindoor , on Sunday said further escalating the recent Indo-Pak conflict by occupying the PoK would have given birth to a ""new monster' for India.""The ceasefire was announced by India after a request from Pakistan DGMO. The war is not a cheap solution, as it comes with heavy expenditure and creates a financial burden.

Khandare, who is the recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Ati Vishisht Seva Medal among other honours, termed Pakistan a police state that often witnesses military rules and political anarchy.Calling Operation Sindoor a convergence between political desire and military action, Khandare lauded affordable, modern innovation in the country's warfare during the May Indo-Pak conflict.""We can adopt high-tech solutions where common sense is added.India fought a high-tech war during Operation Sindoor.

Land-pooling issue ‘settled'

CHANDIGARH: Two days after opposition parties in Punjab complained to Election Commission over ruling AAP's state in-charge Manish Sisodia's ""saam, daam, dand, bhed"" remark in connection with the 2027 assembly election, the party on Monday sought to distance itself from the controversial speech, saying it doesn't reflect AAP's ideology.AAP Punjab chief Aman Arora said the issue had been ""blown out of context"" and that the party would seek votes ""with folded hands"" on the basis of their govt's performance.In response to a media question, Arora said on Monday, ""A single individual — be it me, the chief minister, or party in-charge Manish Sisodia — does not represent the entire party. The video in question does not reflect AAP's ideology.""Asked if AAP was disowning Sisodia's statement, Arora clarified, ""I am saying it in my individual capacity. What was said in that video is not my ideology, nor is it the ideology of Kejriwal, the party, or even Sisodia himself. As I've said, an individual is not the whole party; I too am a small part of it. The issue has been blown out of context. Punjab's culture has always been about seeking votes with love, respect, and folded hands. ""Arvind Kejriwal has always instructed party members to seek votes humbly, by going to the people and highlighting their good work, he said, adding that it's the ""consistent belief of Kejriwal, the party, and himself"".""Those who want to politicise this issue are free to do so. I am confident that the work we completed over the past three and a half years, and our plans for the next one and a half years in Punjab, will earn us strong public support when we ask for their cooperation. I am sure people will support our govt's initiatives,"" he said.""A mountain has been made out of a molehill with Sisodia's clip, and what the rival parties did during previous regimes cannot be overlooked,"" he remarked.Arora was responding to questions about a video clip shared by opposition parties from a purported speech Sisodia gave at an AAP Women's Wing Leadership Training Programme in Mohali on August 13.The clip on social media has Sisodia saying: ""2027 ki chunav jitwane ke liye, saam daam dand bhed; sach jhoot; question-answer; ladai jhagda; jo karna padega karenge. Taiyyaar hein? Josh ke saath? Bahut bhadia"" (To win the 2027 elections, we will use all means necessary — truth, lies, questions, answers, fighting, and quarrelling. Whatever we have to do, we will do. Are you ready? With passion? Very good).""Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar accused Sisodia of openly advocating corrupt and violent practices to win the polls and sought an FIR against him. On Saturday, he wrote to the CEC, demanding action against Sisodia.The AAP leadership said that Sisodia's words had been taken out of context and the clip was being used to misrepresent his speech. An AAP leader told TOI on Saturday that the ""brief, one-minute video does not convey the full meaning or entire thought process"" of what Sisodia was trying to communicate.Responding to a question about the land-pooling scheme that sparked statewide protests until it was scrapped, Aman Arora said that the policy was withdrawn to ""respect the sentiments of farmers"". ""Therefore, the matter is now settled. The process adopted to formulate the policy was no longer relevant. Perhaps, there was a shortcoming in communicating the policy, but it is now immaterial,"" he said.On Aug 7, Punjab and Haryana high court had stayed the policy, flagging several concerns, including the absence of a rehab policy for landless farm labourers, lack of impact assessment studies on society and environment, and the fact that fertile land was shortlisted to be pooled.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday expressed his gratitude to US First Lady Melania Trump for penning a “peace letter” to Russian president Vladimir Putin, addressing the abduction of Ukrainian children.Zelenskyy said the abductions highlighted one of the most “painful and difficult issues” of the conflict and reaffirmed his commitment to pursuing an “all-for-all” exchange of prisoners of war.“I want to thank @FLOTUS Melania Trump for her attention to one of the most painful and difficult issues of this war, the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah—located along today’s Benin coast—exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.","Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

BHOPAL: Panna district collector in Madhya Pradesh on Monday ordered an inquiry into allegations by an elderly couple that they have been declared “dead” in panchayat records and that their land has been usurped.This followed a high-voltage drama, a video of which went viral showing the couple falling at the feet of state higher education minister and Panna district in-charge Inder Singh Parmar during a govt programme, pleading for justice.The incident took place on Sunday at a state horticulture department event in Janwar village.The couple, Bhura Adivasi (78) and his wife Keshkali (75), told the minister that they had been shown as deceased in official records, enabling local residents, along with their son, to seize their house and six acres of land.Eyewitnesses said the couple knelt in front of Parmar, saying, “We are alive, please get us our house and land.” The minister assured them that their matter had already been flagged to the collector.Panna collector Suresh Kumar told TOI that a fact-finding team was dispatched to their village on Monday. “The team found that the couple had migrated to Katni district around 40 years ago following a dispute with a local.They had been living there since, only to return three years ago. Team was told that their land, which is around five acres, was sold by their elder son on grounds that both parents were dead. The son, who sold the land is also dead now. We are getting the land records examined so that the land could be restored to them,” Kumar said.State panchayat secretary Surya Pratap Singh Yadav said that they had been trying to resolve the issue for the last two-and-a-half years. “They don’t have any documents. But when we talked to some elderly people in the village, we were told that the land belongs to them. We are trying our best to help them” he said.Officials said after the couple had migrated to Katni decades ago, they were traced by their niece a few years ago, who brought them back to Panna. By then, their land records had allegedly been manipulated, and they were marked “dead” in panchayat registers.Their niece said she had been repeatedly petitioning the administration since their return but to no avail. With their names struck off as “deceased,” the couple said they have been denied basic entitlements — they have no Aadhaar card, no voter ID, and do not receive old-age pension.","Bhura Adivasi (78) and his wife Keshkali (75) told the minister that they had been shown as deceased in official records.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he would deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States, after Washington raised the bounty for his arrest and launched anti-drug operations in the Caribbean.""This week, I will activate a special plan with more than 4.5 million militiamen to ensure coverage of the entire national territory -- militias that are prepared, activated and armed,"" Maduro announced on state television.The militia, created by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, is officially said to number about five million, though the real figure is believed to be lower.

He faces US drug trafficking charges, with Washington accusing him of leading the Cartel de los Soles, a network it blames for large-scale cocaine smuggling.

US President Donald Trump held a closed-door multilateral meeting with European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, along with guarantees to be provided by European nations in coordination with the United States.Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and seven European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen.During the meeting, a hot mic inadvertently caught audio of Trump whispering to Emmanuel Macron during the meeting.“I think he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand that? As crazy as it sounds,” thereported.The remark suggested that Trump believed Putin was inclined to strike an agreement, offering further insight into his assessment of his recent talks with the Russian leader.Trump had met Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. Both leaders described the meeting in positive terms, but no formal agreement or signed deal was announced.Trump stated, “We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” while adding, “We didn’t get there.” Addressing reporters, he remarked, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”Trump and special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, who also participated in the Alaska summit, claimed that they had secured Putin’s agreement to allow US and other NATO forces to come to Ukraine’s defense should Moscow violate any terms of a potential peace arrangement.Following Monday’s consultations with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump said he called Putin to begin preparing a direct meeting between the two warring sides, which would be followed by a trilateral session including the US president. He confirmed the plan in a post on Truth Social.","US President Donald Trump held a closed-door multilateral meeting with European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said the death of three people in Florida caused by a semi truck's wrong U-turn was a gut-wrenching tragedy which should have never happened.

Trump THREATENS DC Takeover: 1,000 National Guard Troops To ‘CLEAN UP’ Washington?

Trump federalises policing in Washington

Protests and pushback

Concerns over law enforcement role

White House claims success





National Guard members patrolling the US capital as part of President Donald Trump’s policing plan may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.Army Senior Master Sgt Craig Clapper was quoted by NPR as saying that “Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training.”He stressed their role was “focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve,” adding that the Guard “remains committed to assisting the District of Columbia and serving its residents and visitors whenever called upon.”Just days earlier, the Army had said Guard personnel would not carry weapons in public and would not be making arrests. At that point, officials insisted their weapons would remain in the armoury, to be used only if needed, and that deployed troops would instead act as a “visible crime deterrent” while equipped with protective gear such as body armour.The deployment follows President Trump’s announcement earlier this month that the federal government would assume control of the Metropolitan Police Department and flood Washington with hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members.According to the news agency AP, about 800 DC Guard members have already been activated.On Saturday, Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio pledged to send additional reinforcements, between 150 and 400 troops each, to strengthen the federal presence.“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Governor Patrick Morrisey said, as per AP.Trump has defended the takeover, claiming the city has been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people.”However, official data shows violent crime in Washington has actually fallen by 26% compared with last year.The move has triggered strong opposition from residents, local officials and activists, who say the federal intervention represents an overreach of power.DC Mayor Muriel Bowser warned on Friday that the city’s “limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.”On Saturday, hundreds marched from Dupont Circle to the White House, chanting against what they described as a “military occupation.” Protesters held banners reading “No fascist takeover of DC.”Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, was cited by AP as saying that she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for her students’ safety with “unmarked officers of all types” detaining people. John Finnigan, a local resident for nearly three decades, called Trump’s actions “ridiculous” given crime levels are falling.At the Asbury United Methodist Church on Sunday, Rev Ronald Bell Jr used his sermon to call on Black leaders to guide the community through the moment peacefully. Bell, who previously served in Minnesota during the unrest after George Floyd’s killing, said, “I think we have learned lessons from the past. I think we are well equipped to handle this moment.”Some experts have also raised alarms about the National Guard taking on quasi-policing duties. Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown Law professor and former reserve officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, was quoted by NPR as saying, “I think what we’re seeing is the effort to habituate people to the idea that you’re going to have armed federal personnel in your business, asking questions, stopping you, and that’s just truly scary. ”The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of federal armed forces in civilian law enforcement, unless specifically authorised by Congress. But Guard troops, who operate under state control unless federalised, have sometimes been deployed to cities with weapons, most recently to patrol the New York City transit system.Despite criticism, the White House insists Trump’s crackdown is working. Officials said that since 7 August, 308 people had been arrested in Washington, including 135 immigrants living in the US illegally. They added that 53 firearms had been seized.“President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,” spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said on Sunday.“In less than ten days, over 300 dangerous criminals have already been arrested and taken off the streets of Washington, DC President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American greatness to our cherished capital”, Rogers added.","National Guard members patrolling US capital may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.

Hundreds March In NYC Urging Trump To Stop U.S. Arms To Israel Amid Gaza Starvation Crisis





The State Department made a major announcement of halting all visitor visas for people from Gaza for the time being, as it conducts a full and thorough review of the ""process and procedures"" used to issue medial-humanitarian visas in recent days.“All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,” the department wrote in a statement posted to X.The announcement came after MAGA activist Laura Loomer ranted for a day how Palestinians have been entering the country via a humanitarian organization through various airports. Loomer questioned how so many Palestinians were getting visa from the State Department.Loomer said she obtained video footage of Palestinians who claim to be refugees from Gaza coming into the US via San Francisco and Houston. ""The Palestinians traveled from Gaza to the US with the help of a group called 'Heal Palestine'. How did Palestinians get visas under the Trump administration to get into the United States? Did @StateDept approve this? How did they get out of Gaza? Is @SecRubio aware of this?""

Chip Roy (R-Texas) wrote on Friday.Earlier this month, France suspended evacuations from Gaza after a Palestinian student allegedly shared a social media post with an image of Adolf Hitler that called for killing Jews.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told France Info radio that the woman ""must leave the country"" and that she ""has no place"" in France.

A shooting incident in Tremonton, Utah, left at least three police officers injured on Sunday night after a suspect opened fire during a disturbance call.The Brigham City Police Department, which is handling public information on the case, confirmed that the suspect fired at officers responding to the scene near 700 North and 200 East, close to North Park Elementary School, around 9:30 pm (local time), according to Fox 13 Now.Detective Crystal Beck of Brigham City Police told reporters that three officers were shot and later taken to hospital for treatment, though their conditions remain unknown. She also explained that officers had called for backup during the confrontation but eventually stopped responding over their radios.The situation initially caused confusion after Tremonton Mayor Lyle Holmgren posted a statement on Facebook suggesting that two officers had died. Both the city and Holmgren later retracted the claim, with the mayor telling KSL TV’s Alex Cabrero that he could not confirm any details as the scene was still active.The shooting sparked a huge police response, with support from neighbouring law enforcement agencies. As per Newsweek, the suspect was eventually taken into custody and moved to Box Elder County Jail. Authorities confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public, although residents were asked to stay away from the area.A temporary “shelter in place” order had been issued earlier in the night. Officials also said no civilians were hurt.A local resident, Randy Kidman, described his frightening experience when a stray bullet struck his car. “I thought there was somebody lighting off fireworks,” he was quoted as saying by Fox 13 Now. “I come up the road, and I saw two cop cars and something in the road, and decided it wasn’t a good situation. I went to go back out, and when I went to back out, I caught a bullet through the driver’s side door and it went out my windshield… It’s pretty freaky. ”Reported scanner audio from Box Elder County is going viral on social media, which captured the tense exchanges between officers during the incident, including calls for SWAT support and reports of two officers down at the intersection near the school. However, the authenticity of the audio can’t be verified.The name of the suspect has not yet been released.","A shooting incident in Tremonton, Utah, left at least three police officers injured on Sunday night after a suspect opened fire during a disturbance call.

Trump signals support for security guarantees



Europeans heap praise but note tough road ahead



A different reception for Zelenskyy



Putin’s shadow over the talks



Trump hints at rapid resolution



Plans for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting



Hot mic reveals Trump’s private thoughts



Ceasefire debate divides leaders



Zelenskyy launches a charm offensive



Security guarantees tied to arms deals







US President Donald Trump’s White House meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top European leaders gave the clearest sign yet of a potential path to peace talks between war-torn Ukraine and sanction-laden Russia.The Oval Office encounter marked a sharp departure from their strained February meeting, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance openly criticised Zelenskyy. This time, there were more smiles, warmer words and discussions about security guarantees for Kyiv.The talks came just days after Trump’s Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin , which failed to deliver a ceasefire but left the US leader convinced Moscow wanted a deal. Trump even phoned Putin after Monday’s session to brief him directly, and later revealed that arrangements had begun for a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting.The summit also offered moments of levity, with Zelenskyy dressed in formal attire, a charm offensive directed at Trump, and even a hot mic capturing the US President’s private views on Putin. But behind the pleasantries, difficult questions remained: How to guarantee Ukraine’s security, whether a ceasefire is essential, and what compromises – if any – should be made on territory.A central theme was Trump’s openness to backing European-led security guarantees for Ukraine, even while ruling out Nato membership. “European countries want to give protection and they feel very strongly about it and we’ll help them out with that,” Trump said. Zelenskyy welcomed the message, calling it “such (a) strong signal.” While no details were finalised, the discussion ranged from large-scale peacekeeping deployments to smaller “tripwire” or observer forces. Trump has not committed US troops, but he left the door open. European leaders stressed that guarantees must deter future Russian aggression, with Macron warning they are about “the whole security of the European continent.”European leaders sought to show unity, flanking Trump with praise while signalling that complex negotiations lay ahead. Nato chief Mark Rutte addressed Trump as “dear Donald” and later called him “amazing” on Fox News. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed “real progress” and a “real sense of unity.” But German Chancellor Friedrich Merz struck a cautionary tone, saying “the path is open now” though next steps were “more complicated. ” Ursula von der Leyen insisted that talks must aim for a “just and lasting peace.” Trump himself was noncommittal, remarking: “If we can do the ceasefire, great,” but quickly aligning with Putin’s view that peace, not a ceasefire, should be the priority.Zelenskyy’s latest Oval Office appearance stood in stark contrast to February, when Trump and Vance scolded him for ingratitude and even mocked his attire. This time, Ukraine’s President arrived in a black suit and shirt, prompting right-wing reporter Brian Glenn to tell him: “You look fabulous.” Trump immediately chimed in: “I said the same thing!” Zelenskyy deflected with humour, joking to Glenn: “You are in the same suit. I changed. You did not.” The mood was lighter, with both presidents clasping their hands calmly as they fielded questions. Zelenskyy also expressed repeated gratitude, even thanking First Lady Melania Trump for sending Putin a letter about the war’s toll on children.Even as European leaders pressed their case, Putin loomed large in Trump’s remarks. The US President repeatedly said the Russian leader “wants it to end” and spoke about updating him on progress. At one point, Trump phoned Putin directly after the meeting, holding a 40-minute call. German Chancellor Merz compared Russia’s demand that Ukraine cede Donbas territory to the US giving up Florida. Still, Trump suggested Putin was open to “security guarantees,” with envoy Steve Witkoff claiming Moscow could accept Nato-style protections for Kyiv. Macron reinforced the message, insisting that “security guarantees” meant safeguarding the entire European continent.Trump, who during his presidential campaign claimed that he could end the war “in a day,” tempered but still played up expectations. “A week or two weeks, we’ll know whether we’re going to solve this, or if this horrible fighting is going to continue,” he said. He insisted the issues were not “overly complex,” though they include territory, Ukraine’s future military capacity and enduring security guarantees. Outside the White House, Zelenskyy admitted no date had been set for a Putin meeting but that Trump was pressing for it “as soon as possible. ” He added that questions of land concessions would be left to “between me and Putin.”Trump announced he was arranging a face-to-face between Putin and Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral summit including himself. On Truth Social, he wrote: “Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine.” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov later said Putin and Trump had spoken “in favour” of continuing direct talks, though no location was confirmed. Zelenskyy told reporters he was “ready” for such a meeting, while Macron floated the idea of expanding it to include top European leaders. If confirmed, it would mark the first encounter between Putin and Zelenskyy since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.Before the formal talks began, Trump was caught on a hot mic with Macron. Whispering in the East Room, he said of Putin: “I think he wants to make a deal. I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand that? As crazy as it sounds.” The remark underscored Trump’s belief that Putin views him as a unique broker for peace. Trump also mentioned setting up a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy, echoing what he would later announce publicly. The candid aside highlighted the unusual role Trump sees for himself — both as mediator and as the dealmaker Putin allegedly prefers.One of the sharpest divides emerged over whether a ceasefire is a prerequisite for negotiations. Trump downplayed its necessity, saying: “I don’t know that it’s necessary.” That aligned with Putin’s view but clashed with European leaders. Merz was blunt: “I can’t imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire.” He pressed for more pressure on Russia, while Macron and others echoed calls for de-escalation. Zelenskyy, notably, did not repeat his earlier demands for a ceasefire, instead leaving the matter open. The question now threatens to shape the next phase of talks, with Trump willing to sidestep it in favour of pursuing longer-term agreements.Mindful of his rocky last visit, Zelenskyy embarked on a deliberate charm offensive. Within minutes he offered six “thank yous,” presented Trump with a letter from his wife to Melania Trump, and dressed in a formal suit. Trump reacted warmly, joking: “I cannot believe it. I love it. Look at you.” Zelenskyy also kept the humour going when Glenn, the conservative reporter who previously mocked him, complimented his new look. The Ukrainian leader replied: “I changed, you have not.” European leaders, meanwhile, dialled up their flattery of Trump, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saying “something had changed” thanks to him, while Nato chief Rutte praised his “leadership.”Zelenskyy revealed that part of the security guarantees under discussion involved a massive arms package. He told reporters the US and Ukraine had reached a preliminary $90 billion agreement for advanced weapons, including aviation and anti-missile systems. He also said the US would purchase Ukrainian-made drones to fund their domestic production. The Financial Times reported Ukraine had agreed to buy $100 billion in US weapons financed by Europe in return for American security backing. Trump remained vague but promised: “We’ll give them good protection.” Zelenskyy said terms could be finalised within 10 days, with leaders framing it as a foundation for future peace talks.","US President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top European leaders.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.
