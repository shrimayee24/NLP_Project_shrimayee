NEW DELHI: Residents of Rohini 's Prashant Vihar woke up to unusual vibrations on Sunday morning, jolted by a thunderous sound.Fearing an earthquake, they rushed outside, only to be met with a chemical-like odour and thick white smoke, leaving them in shock.No one was injured although there were around a dozen men near the site.CCTV footage from near the CRPF school captured the moment when the explosion disrupted the morning calm, shattering window panes in nearby buildings.In the evening, a Telegram group allegedly linked to banned outfit Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) claimed responsibility, posting a message with a veiled reference to Lawrence Bishnoi along with CCTV footage of the blast.Advocate Shashank Goswami said: ""When I came out of my house, I was unable to see anything.

Pakistan-based PAFF links Kashmir tunnel attack to Chinese interests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-based-paff-links-kashmir-tunnel-attack-to-chinese-interests/articleshow/114436935.cms,"A policeman guards during the funeral of Kashmiri doctor Shahnawaz who was among those killed when terrorists fired at people working on a tunnel project in Kashmir, Monday, October 21, 2024. (AP)

SRINAGAR: A Chinese angle surfaced Monday in a statement by Pakistan-based terrorist outfit People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) following the mass shooting on the campsite of a tunnel-construction company in Gagangir village of central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district Sunday night that left a doctor and six workers dead. The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba , claimed responsibility for the attack.In its statement, PAFF praised TRF for what it called a “strategic attack” on workers engaged in building the Z-Morh tunnel. PAFF claimed the attack aimed to disrupt Indian military deployments toward the eastern border, stating it was “against our military interests and those of our Chinese friends”.While it’s known that China and Pakistan have strategic cooperation, officials said there’s no evidence to support Beijing’s involvement beyond the statement by PAFF. They said the reference to “Chinese friends” is a rhetorical attempt by PAFF to align their goals with China’s interests.The 6.5km-long tunnel on the Srinagar-Leh highway is a critical infrastructure project designed to provide all-weather connectivity between Kashmir and Ladakh. The tunnel, being constructed by UP-based APCO Infratech , is slated for inauguration in early Nov. Officials said the project’s timeline remains unchanged.“Military projects in an occupied territory are death traps. Hence, every sane-minded person should avoid them,” PAFF said. However, officials countered that such infrastructure in sensitive regions are dual-use, so characterising the tunnel solely as a military project might be misleading.TRF claimed its Falcon Squad targeted the construction site, describing the project as one intended primarily for military transportation. It reiterated its warnings to locals and non-locals to avoid working on “illegal projects”. The group expressed regret for civilian casualties but warned of further attacks on similar infrastructure efforts.According to intelligence officials, the attack was carried out under the orders of TRF chief Sheikh Sajjad Gul, who carries a Rs 10 lakh bounty announced by NIA in 2022. Around 8.15 pm, two to three Pakistani terrorists armed with automatic weapons stormed the campsite, targeting workers who had gathered for dinner in the mess area.The victims included three workers from Bihar — Faheem Nasir, Mohammad Hanif, and Abdul Kaleem — along with Anil Shukla from Madhya Pradesh, Gurmeet Singh from Punjab, architectural engineer Shashi Bhushan Abrol from Jammu, and Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar from Budgam district in Kashmir.Widespread condemnation emerged across Kashmir, with rallies and candlelit marches expressing solidarity with the victims’ families. A notable march in Tangmarg, led by the sub-divisional magistrate in collaboration with local associations, saw residents from various backgrounds participate in a peaceful demonstration. Similar events took place in Boniyar and Pulwama, where community leaders like Shoaib Pathan and Mudasir Dar condemned the violence.Residents of slain physician Shahnawaz Dar’s village in Budgam district shouted slogans against CM Omar Abdullah for not visiting his home to offer his condolences. Ministers Javid Dar and Sakina Itoo visited the family in the evening.A team from NIA arrived in Gagangir Monday to investigate whether cross-border outfits were directly involved in the attack, marking it as the deadliest terrorist attack in 2024 after the June 9 ambush in Reasi district, which killed nine pilgrims.Security forces launched a manhunt in the forests surrounding Gagangir to locate the attackers. They are intensifying efforts to secure sensitive projects, especially those with strategic importance along the eastern front.J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha condemned the attack and vowed retaliation. “Security forces will avenge these deaths and ensure the terrorists pay a heavy price,” he said. Sinha also criticized Pakistan for “persisting in killing innocent people” to disrupt peace in the region.The LG announced financial aid for the victims’ families, with Rs 6 lakh from the govt and Rs 15 lakh in immediate relief from the construction firm APCO Infratech. Each family will also receive five years of the deceased worker’s salary. Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will also be provided to the wounded.Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expressed deep sorrow over the deaths of three workers from his state and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh for each family.Politicians across the spectrum condemned the attack. National Conference president Farooq Abdullah urged Pakistan to stop targeting civilians if it wished to improve ties with India. “Kashmir will not become Pakistan. Let us live with dignity,” he said. “How can dialogue take place if innocent people continue to be killed?”Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also condemned the attack, calling it a “grim reminder of the unending cycle of violence” in Kashmir. “Islam, like all religions, deplores such inhuman behaviour,” he said.","A Chinese angle surfaced Monday in a statement by Pakistan-based terrorist outfit People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) PAFF claimed the attack aimed to disrupt Indian military deployments toward the eastern border.

SHIMLA: After getting a go-ahead from Himachal Pradesh waqf board, the Sanjauli mosque committee on Monday started demolition of the three illegal storeys of the mosque in Shimla.The court of Shimla municipal commissioner, Bhupender Kumar Attri, had on Oct 5 ordered the Muslim Welfare Committee to raze the top three storeys of the mosque within two months at its own expense.Mosque committee president Mohammed Latif said, “The committee has hired labourers to remove the tin roof of the building as well as the attic. The order of the municipal commissioner court is being followed in letter and spirit, but it may take three to four months to raze the illegally constructed portions of the mosque because of lack of funds.”Welcoming the move, Himachal CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said: “It would be the first such example where people of the Muslim community have themselves come forward to maintain peace and brotherhood in the state. People of every caste, community and religion live honourably and peacefully in Himachal Pradesh, and everybody has the right to work in the state.”Urban local bodies minister Vikramaditya Singh said if the committee faced funds crunch or wanted more time for demolition, it could move an application before the municipal commissioner’s court, which could take a decision as per law.Devbhoomi Sangharsh Samiti, which led the protests for the demolition of unauthorised portions of the mosque, also hailed the decision. Meanwhile, HP high court, while hearing a petition filed by the local residents, directed Shimla municipal commissioner court to decide within eight weeks the main pending case regarding Sanjauli mosque’s unauthorised construction.","After getting a go-ahead from Himachal Pradesh waqf board, the Sanjauli mosque committee on Monday started demolition of the three illegal storeys of the mosque in Shimla.

Instead, what she received was news that would shatter her world — her husband, Shashi Abrol, had been killed in a terror attack in Kashmir’s Ganderbal district late Sunday night.Shashi, an architectural designer, was one of seven victims in a deadly attack on a tunnel construction site on the Srinagar-Leh national highway.The attack occurred just after Shashi and his team had returned to their camp for the night, turning the festive occasion of Karwa Chauth into a nightmare for his family.""I spoke to him in the evening. He didn’t mention any threats.

Our dear Shashi Ji was killed in a cowardly act by terrorists.""Shashi had been working for six years with APCO, a construction company, and was the family’s sole breadwinner.

Did Hurricane Milton wash ashore a '1700s Ghost Ship' in St Augustine?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-hurricane-milton-wash-ashore-a-1700s-ghost-ship-in-st-augustine/articleshow/114383291.cms,"Expert debunks the myth

Can Hurricanes actually cause 'ghost ships' to wash ashore?



(Inputs taken from Pensacola news Journal)

There was a social media buzz on Wednesday with rumours of a “1700s ghost ship” that allegedly washed ashore near St Augustine, Florida , following Hurricane Milton . Despite several inconsistencies, the story went viral, captivating thousands of users.However, it was eventually debunked as false.The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.Despite the fact that the storm hit on October 9—exactly one week before the alleged sighting—and on the opposite side of the state, the ghost ship story still gained significant traction. The original post amassed over 21,000 shares, with users spreading the narrative widely.As it turns out, the ghost ship tale was a piece of satire. It originated from Casper Planet , a Facebook page known for its humorous and entirely fabricated stories, similar to The Onion.Casper Planet posted a follow-up story on Friday morning titled, “Tourists Outraged After Discovering Non-Existent 1700s Pirate Ship in Florida ‘Wasn’t Real’ All Along.” The page continued to poke fun at the viral spread of the ghost ship narrative.In its initial post, Casper Planet claimed that the ship had “emerged from the ocean’s depths as the Category 4 storm [Hurricane Milton] churned the Atlantic, sending the ancient ship onto the beach.” The dramatic description added a sense of mystery, but it was factually inaccurate. Hurricane Milton had made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, on Florida’s central west coast. It then crossed the state’s peninsula, exiting near Brevard and Indian River counties—over 120 miles fromSt. Augustine .To lend the story an air of credibility, the page included a fabricated quote from a fictional marine archaeologist named “Dr. Andrew Clarke,” who said, “This is unprecedented. To see a ship this old, in such good condition, simply appear out of the ocean during a hurricane − it’s both fascinating and chilling.”According to First Coast News report, Chuck Meide, director of the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program at the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum. Meide debunked the ghost ship claim, explaining that the depiction of the ship was unrealistic.“Most of the wood from a ship hundreds of years old would have been eaten by critters like ship worms,” Meide explained. In cases where parts of such ancient ships do survive, it’s typically the lower portion of the vessel, which gets buried beneath the seafloor.While the ghost ship story was a hoax, there is some truth to the concept of hurricanes washing abandoned ships ashore. In fact, such incidents have occurred in the past.According to Weather.com, a 45-foot ghost ship named Lady Catherine III washed ashore on Pensacola Beach on June 18 during Tropical Storm Alberto. The vessel, battered but still intact, was found with no passengers on board. It was later discovered that the boat belonged to Michael Barlow, a Texas man who had abandoned it earlier that month after encountering the storm.In another instance, a 45-foot sailboat named Cuki broke free from its mooring in Key West during Hurricane Irma in 2017. The boat drifted over 300 miles up Florida’s eastern coast before washing ashore at Spessard Holland South Beach Park. According to USA Today, the boat remained there for two years before it was demolished. Its owner, Jeffrey Sundwall of Key West, was later imprisoned at Jackson Correctional Institution in Malone, Florida, on charges including sexual battery, cocaine possession, obstruction of a criminal investigation, and possession of child pornography.","The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.

Article 21: ED should remember there’s something called Article 21: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-should-remember-theres-something-called-art-21-sc/articleshow/114438608.cms,"NEW DELHI: “They ( ED officers) should remember that there is something called Article 21 in the country (which guarantees right to life and liberty),” Supreme Court on Monday told the agency while expressing concern over the way in which PMLA was being implemented and made it clear that any high-handedness against any accused in violation of their fundamental rights would not be allowed.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih took exception to the way in which former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was issued summons and arrested in a tearing hurry, and sought an explanation from ED.The court noted that Tuteja was summoned by ED when he was in the office of Anti-Corruption Bureau , where he was being interrogated, and asked to appear before the anti-money laundering agency. ED issued a second summons a few hours later when he did not appear before it at the time fixed by the agency.ED in its affidavit earlier told SC that Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla, two bureaucrats accused in Chhattisgarh ’s Nagrik Apurti Nigam scam, “were in touch with the HC judge who granted bail to Shukla” in Oct 2019. The then advocate general, Satish Chandra Verma , had been liaisoning between the two and the judge, ED claimed.Challenging the arrest for violation of established procedure, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi contended that Tuteja was taken by ACB officers to the ED office, where he was interrogated the whole night. But additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for ED, refuted the allegation and said that he had appeared voluntarily.“Show us how they came voluntarily. Why should ACB officers accompany them to ED? Please explain to us this procedure. He is in the ACB office when ED issues summons at 12noon and then at 5.30pm. Why is this tearing hurry?” the bench asked the ASG.Raju submitted that the allegation was very serious and it was not that ED tortured Tuteja — he was simply asked to come. But the bench said that it was not about the seriousness of the offence but the way arrest was carried out. It directed the agency to furnish the time at which summonses against Tuteja were issued and the time at which they were served. The court also sought to know how ED came to know that the accused was in the ACB office.“If you knew that he was being interrogated in the ACB office, why was the time of 12.30 given? What was the hurry to issue summonses two times when you knew that he was being interrogated by the ACB? This doesn’t happen (even) in the case of terrorism or serious offences in the IPC,” the bench observed.The court said that it would come down heavily on such practices and the officer concerned should be taken to task.Raju told the court that the agency had already issued a circular asking its officers not to conduct interrogation at odd hours. The court thereafter asked him to file an affidavit on the manner in which he was arrested.At the end of the proceedings, the bench said in a lighter vein that judges are also human beings and they see every day the way in which PMLA law is being implemented, perhaps hinting at recent verdicts of the apex court through which some stringent provisions of the anti-money laundering law had been diluted.",Former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was issued summons and arrested in a tearing hurry. The court expressed concern over the way in which PMLA was being implemented. It made it clear that any high-handedness against any accused in violation of their fundamental rights would not be allowed.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114438652,imgsize-678867,width-400,resizemode-4/114438652.jpg"

NAGPUR: Five Maoists were killed Monday during an eight-hour gunfight with C-60 commando units and CRPF quick-action teams that stormed the booby-trapped Abujmarh headquarters of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) in an offensive ahead of elections in Maharashtra next month.At least 2,500 rounds were fired during the joint operation to overrun the once-impregnable Maoist bastion spread across the rocky, treacherous terrain of the Dandakaranya forest , 6km off Koparshi, the last village on the Maharashtra side of the border with Chhattisgarh.The guns fell silent by sunset, enabling the 22 commando squads from Gadchiroli Police and the two CRPF quick-action teams to mop up and make a safe exit with the bodies of the slain Maoists, three of them women.One of the more dramatic moments of the operation in Abujmarh, which straddles Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, came when a woman pilot of a hired Pawan Hans chopper braved shelling by the Maoists to hover a few feet above the encounter site and airlift a wounded commando to Nagpur via Gadchiroli for medical treatment. The commando, who took three bullets, was in a critical condition until late Monday.The slain Maoists were part of PLGA’s “Company 10”, entrusted with guarding the dense forest and undulating terrain of Abujmarh, the nerve centre of Maoists in Central India.The encounter spanned two sites 7km apart on the Chhattisgarh side of the so-called Red corridor. C-60 and CRPF commandos moved inside the forest three days ago and were combing the area for landmines before engaging with the guerrillas guarding the Maoist bastion and the outfit’s top commanders.Sources said commander Prabhakaran, who heads the Gadchiroli division of PLGA, dodged past the commando cordon as his bodyguards provided cover.Home minister Amit Shah had set March 2026 as the deadline for Chhattisgarh and Dec2025 for Maharashtra to wipe out Maoists from their states.The weaponry strewn across ground zero included INSAS rifles, Kalashnikovs, and other assault rifles. A cache of ammunition, magazines, walkie-talkies, detonator wires, explosives, and other materials were also found.Based on an intelligence input, commando teams crossed the Koparshi Nullah to venture into Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh, officials said.Additional SPs Yatish Deshmukh and M Ramesh led a section each of the contingent. Deshmukh’s team engaged with PLGA near Tekameta hamlet, 2km off the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, while the squad helmed by Ramesh cornered the guerrillas near Kodhur hamlet, 7km inside Chhattisgarh.","Five Maoists killed in eight-hour gunfight with C-60 commando units and CRPF quick-action teams.

Will Hamas get a new chief after Yahya Sinwar's death? Here's what reports suggest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-hamas-get-a-new-chief-after-yahya-sinwars-death-heres-what-reports-suggest/articleshow/114443946.cms,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week, a move that has spurred discussions within the group about its leadership moving forward.According to sources within Hamas, the group has decided not to name a new leader until the next internal elections scheduled for March, provided circumstances allow.“The Hamas leadership's approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections,” a source from the group told AFP.Mewanwhile, a five-member committee, which was formed in August after the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, will assume leadership responsibilities. Sinwar, who was appointed Gaza chief of Hamas in 2017, ascended to the top leadership role after Haniyeh's assassination in July.The committee, comprised of key representatives from Gaza, the West Bank, and the Palestinian diaspora, includes Khalil al-Hayya (Gaza), Zaher Jabarin (West Bank), and Khaled Meshaal (representing Palestinians abroad). Two other key members are Mohammed Darwish, head of Hamas's Shura advisory council, and the political bureau's secretary. All members of the committee are currently based in Qatar.The committee has been tasked with governing Hamas during the ongoing conflict, making strategic decisions, and shaping the group's future plans. “The committee will govern the movement during the war and exceptional circumstances, as well as its future trajectory,” the source said.Another source revealed that there had been internal discussions about appointing a political chief whose identity would remain secret, but the leadership ultimately chose to proceed with collective rule through the committee.Sinwar's death came as Israeli forces intensified their military operations in Gaza. He was killed in southern Gaza, more than a year into the war that erupted after Hamas launched a major offensive on October 7.The death of Yahya Sinwar has created a leadership vacuum within the Palestinian terrorist organization. Various reports speculated about potential candidates who could step into the role.","Hamas is leaning toward appointing a ruling committee based in Doha rather than a single successor following the death of their chief, Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces last week.

DHAKA: Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin found himself in the crosshairs of the interim government on Monday after law adviser Asif Nazrul accused him of lying about not having ""documentary evidence"" of ex-PM Sheikh Hasina resigning before her Aug 5 flight from the country.Shahabuddin's remark that he had ""only heard"" about Hasina's resignation supported her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy 's statement to Reuters from Washington that his mother ""never officially resigned"" as she ""didn't have the time"" to do so once anti-government protesters stormed her Dhaka residence.""When things came under control, one day the cabinet secretary came to collect the copy of the resignation letter. I told him that I was also looking for it,"" a report in the magazine Janatar Chokh quoted the president as saying.Section 57(a) of the Bangladesh constitution states that the prime ministerial office falls vacant only if the incumbent steps down by writing to the president.The resurgence of conspiracy theories about the circumstances of Hasina's departure led law adviser Nazrul to criticise the president for making what he said was a ""self-contradictory"" remark and ""akin to a violation of his oath"".He referred to Shahabuddin's address to the nation on August 5, in which he said the ex-PM had handed him her resignation. This was hours after Hasina flew out of the country.A political insider said he wouldn't be surprised if the interim government removed Shahabuddin as president. ""The government's response suggests that the council of advisers will discuss in a meeting whether Shahabuddin is fit to remain in office."" Nazrul hinted as much to the media. ""We know that the constitution says if the president lacks the physical or mental capacity to hold office or commits serious misconduct, steps can be taken regarding that position,"" he said. ""If someone contradicts their own statements made publicly, that could be considered misconduct. Then questions may arise about their mental capacity to serve as president. The president himself has opened the door to such scrutiny.""BNP functionary Hafizuddin Ahmed said the discussions around Hasina's resignation had added a new dimension to the ongoing political drama .

The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Wearing an apron over his suit and tie, the Republican presidential nominee took aim at Kamala Harris ’ long-standing claim of working at the fast-food chain in her college days.With reporters and MAGA aides gathered around, Trump received a crash course in fry-making, eagerly dunking baskets of fries into sizzling oil, salting them, and scooping them into boxes.Trump, a well-known fan of McDonald's, said, ""I don’t even have to touch them with my hands! Incredible!"", grinning as he maneuvered his way around the fry station. “It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,” he added with a smirk.Trump's impromptu stint behind the counter was more than just a quirky photo op. As Election Day looms just weeks away, the visit was a thinly veiled jab at Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Harris has spoken about her time working at McDonald's during her college years, a story Trump has repeatedly questioned, dubbing her ""Lyin' Kamala.""Seizing the opportunity, Trump claimed he had worked longer at the McDonald's fry station that day than Harris did during her college stint. “Fifteen minutes longer, believe me!” he said. ""I love McDonald's, I love jobs, and I love seeing good jobs,” he added.But the show didn’t stop at the fry station. Trump, apron still on, took to the drive-thru window for an impromptu press conference, leaning out to answer questions from reporters huddled outside. Asked what message he had for Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday, which coincidentally fell on the same day, Trump said, ""Happy Birthday, Kamala! I think I’ll get her some flowers.""Trump’s fry-slinging tour in the battleground state was part of a broader effort to keep Harris’s McDonald's story in the spotlight, continuing to question the legitimacy of her summer job experience. “I could do this all day,” he boasted, poking fun at the notion of Harris having done the same years ago.As the fast-food spectacle wound down, aides nudged Trump to wrap things up, reminding him of his next campaign stop. With a final flourish, he leaned out of the window and declared, “Wasn’t that a strange place to do a news conference?”Before leaving, Trump, who has often sidestepped questions about minimum wage policies, took a moment to praise the McDonald’s crew. “These people work hard. They’re great. I just saw something … a process that’s beautiful.” He sidestepped directly addressing whether his presidency would support wage increases for those manning the fryers.The former president left Pennsylvania, proving that in Trump’s world, even McDonald’s can be a campaign battlefield.","Donald Trump took over the fry station at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday.

Exonerated Five: Exonerated Central Park Five file defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/exonerated-central-park-five-file-defamation-lawsuit-against-donald-trump/articleshow/114443460.cms,"File photo: The Central Park Five (Picture credit: AP)

The Exonerated Five , formerly known as the Central Park Five , have filed a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump , accusing him of making false statements during a recent presidential debate.According to a report by the Associated Press, the lawsuit seeks to hold Trump accountable for the harm caused by his repeated false claims.The legal action, filed in a Philadelphia federal court, stems from remarks Trump made during his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris , where he falsely claimed that the five men had killed someone and pleaded guilty to the crime.""Defendant Trump falsely stated that plaintiffs killed an individual and pled guilty to the crime. These statements are demonstrably false,” the group wrote in their complaint.The Exonerated Five—Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, and Antron McCray—were wrongfully convicted in 1989 for the rape and assault of a jogger in Central Park. Their convictions were overturned in 2002 following the discovery of new DNA evidence and a confession from another individual. Trump’s recent comments during the debate have reopened old wounds for the men, who have spent years working to rebuild their lives after their wrongful imprisonment.During the nationally televised debate, Trump stated, ""They admitted, they said they pled guilty… if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.” In reality, no one was killed in the attack, and the confessions obtained from the men were later proven to have been coerced.The lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages, arguing that Trump’s statements were made recklessly, with a complete disregard for the truth. Shanin Specter , the attorney representing the group, emphasized the harm caused by Trump's remarks, noting that ""Trump essentially defamed them in front of 67 million people."" Specter further clarified that there was no political motive behind the lawsuit, stating that the men were simply seeking justice in court.Trump's spokesperson, Steven Cheung, dismissed the lawsuit as politically driven, labeling it ""just another frivolous, election interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists."" The Trump campaign has yet to formally respond to the legal action.The Central Park Five case has long been a contentious issue between Trump and the group. In 1989, Trump took out a full-page advertisement in several New York newspapers, calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in response to the crime. Despite their exoneration, Trump has consistently refused to retract his statements or offer an apology. In 2019, he reaffirmed his belief that ""they admitted their guilt"" even after DNA evidence proved their innocence.Now known as the Exonerated Five, the men have been vocal critics of Trump, with Yusef Salaam recently becoming a member of the New York City Council.","The Exonerated Five, formerly known as the Central Park Five, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump.

US expresses concerns over deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-expresses-concerns-over-deployment-of-north-korean-troops-to-ukraine/articleshow/114443891.cms,"The United States has raised concerns over reports suggesting that North Korea may be sending troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine , calling it a ""dangerous and highly concerning development."" The US and its allies, including South Korea and the United Kingdom, have warned of the potential geopolitical consequences if such actions are confirmed.Deputy US Ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, emphasized the gravity of the situation during a UN Security Council meeting on Monday.""We are consulting with our allies and partners on the implications of such a dramatic move,"" Wood stated, underscoring the deepening ties between North Korea and Russia. This follows allegations from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who claimed that Pyongyang is preparing to send 10,000 soldiers to assist Moscow.Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya further added that North Korean troops are expected to be ready for combat by November 1. South Korea’s intelligence agency had previously reported that North Korea had already sent 1,500 special forces to Russia’s Far East for training, with plans to deploy them in the conflict.Wood stressed that if these reports are accurate, it would signify a significant escalation in the relationship between Russia and North Korea. ""This marks an obvious deepening of the DPRK-Russia military relationship,"" he said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).The Kremlin has not directly addressed these allegations. However, Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Moscow's cooperation with Pyongyang is not intended to target any third countries. Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the reports as part of a larger pattern of Western ""scare-mongering,"" accusing Western nations of exaggerating threats involving Iran, China, and North Korea.British UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward, however, stated it was ""highly likely"" that North Korea is sending troops, suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin is struggling to recruit domestic forces for his war. ""It seems that the harder Putin finds it to recruit Russians to be cannon fodder, the more willing he is to rely on DPRK in his illegal war,"" she said.South Korean UN Ambassador Joonkook Hwang also weighed in, warning that North Korea will likely demand substantial compensation from Moscow for its involvement, which could include military or financial support. He also raised concerns that this could extend to nuclear weapons-related technology.North Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006 due to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, with Russia previously supporting these international measures. The potential for increased military cooperation between the two countries has sparked widespread concern among Western nations.","Reports suggest that North Korea may be sending troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Iran has issued a stern warning to the United States , saying that it would bear ""full responsibility"" if Israel launches a retaliatory attack against the Islamic Republic.This comes after US President Joe Biden 's remarks suggesting his awareness of Israel's plans to retaliate. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations , expressed grave concern over Biden 's comments in a letter addressed to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN Security Council The controversy stems from President Biden's response to a reporter's question on Friday, where he affirmed his understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran's missile barrage on October 1.Iran had launched approximately 200 ballistic missiles at Israel as retaliation for the killing of leaders from Hamas, Hezbollah, and an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. In response, Israel, currently engaged in conflicts with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, pledged to seek revenge against Iran for the strikes.In his letter, Iravani strongly criticised Biden's statement, describing it as ""profoundly alarming and provocative."" He said that the US president's words implied ""tacit approval and explicit support for Israel's unlawful military aggression against Iran.""""Therefore, the United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,"" he added.According to reports from the Washington Post, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has informed President Biden of his intention to target Iran's military sites, while avoiding strikes on nuclear or oil infrastructure.","Iran's ambassador to the U.N. expressed grave concern over Biden's comments in a letter addressed to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN Security Council.

The New York Magazine Monday announced that the reporter, Olivia Nuzzi , who was placed on leave over her undisclosed relationship with RFK Jr , has parted ways with the magazine. ""Last month, the magazine enlisted the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine to review Olivia Nuzzi’s work during the 2024 campaign. They reached the same conclusion as the magazine’s initial internal review of her published work, finding no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias.Nevertheless, the magazine and Nuzzi agreed that the best course forward is to part ways. Nuzzi is a uniquely talented writer and we have been proud to publish her work over her nearly eight years as our Washington Correspondent. We wish her the best,"" the statement read.Ari Wilkenfeld, an attorney for Nuzzi, said she was gratified though not surprised that two different investigations have determined that her reporting on the 2024 campaign was sound and that she did nothing wrong.”“For nearly eight years, she consistently produced critically celebrated and hugely popular journalism in her capacity as the Washington Correspondent for New York Magazine,” Wilkenfeld said. “She is grateful for the editors, fact checkers, and artists with whom she worked and to the readers who have supported her with their time, subscriptions, and engagement. She looks forward to the next chapter of her career.”A major controversy broke out after it was reported that a New York magazine reporter was in a relationship with Kennedy Jr, who is an aide of Donald Trump in the election 2024. Nuzzi said the relationship was not physical and was based on text messages. Kennedy Jr denied the relationship and said he met Olivia Nuzzi only once when she interviewed him for a profile last year when he was in the presidential race.Much of mudslinging followed with Kennedy Jr camp claiming that Olivia Nuzzi used to send Kennedy nudes and even after being blocked by the politician, she found ways to get unblocked. Nuzzi camp hit back claiming that the first move was made by Kennedy Jr who grabbed her arm during the interview which creeped Nuzzi out.Apparently, Nuzzi's engagement with a fellow reporter of Politico, Ryan Lizza, broke off because of Nuzzi's involvement with Kennedy Jr. Nuzzi accused Lizza of orchestrating a harassment and blackmail campaign against her.","The New York Magazine Monday announced that the reporter, Olivia Nuzzi, who was placed on leave over her undisclosed relationship with RFK Jr, has parted ways with the magazine.

The quarter ending in September has been the biggest fund-raising quarter ever for Vice President Kamala Harris as her campaign managed to raise $1 billion in three months -- $378 million in September alone. And Trump campaign in September raised $160 million -- despite the backing of the world's richest man Elon Musk.According to an NYT report, Harris campaign entered October with $348 million on hand and Trump campaign with $283 million.Kamala Harris was seen as the winner of the ABC News presidential debate and every month since June, when Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race, Harris out-raised and outspent Trump.The previous record for the highest fund-raising quarter across all party committees is probably held by Joe Biden in the third quarter of 2020 when his campaign raised $888 million. September fund this year is less that September 2020 for both Biden-Harris and Donald Trump.Trump has consistently raised less money than his 2020 run, NYT reported and attributed it to the struggle that his low-dollar fund raising apparatus is doing to keep up with the pace four years ago.

Donald Trump: US Presidential Election Top 10: Donald Trump – McDonald’s ‘Employee of the Month’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-top-10-donald-trump-mcdonalds-employee-of-the-month/articleshow/114433720.cms,"One of politics' greatest drawbacks is that it favours gifted thespians or orators over able administrators. How natural one appears while serving takeout at McDonald’s or buying Doritos shouldn’t decide who gets to hold the nuclear football and become the leader of the free world. Sadly, that’s not how the ball rolls, and ever since being shoehorned in at the last minute after Democrats refused to accept the reality about Joe Biden Kamala Harris has been going all out to prove she’s relatable, which has been a hard sell so far.She also appears to have a bizarre strategy of media engagement, where she first avoided interviews, but then started giving more, getting stuck in David Sacks’ prophetic “doom loop”: the more interviews Harris gives, the more her ratings suffer. On the other hand, Donald Trump appears to have found a second wind in recent weeks and is looking stronger than ever, the bumbling old man of the ABC debate completely forgotten.Trump’s mini-renaissance appears to have started from the Flagrant podcast . He was in fine form during the Al Smith Dinner that Kamala Harris skipped, a curious choice given Catholics aren’t just a significantly high voting bloc but consist of much of the “haves and have-lots”, who George W Bush once joked was his base. Of course, Harris’ decision to skip the Al Smith Dinner could have been mediated by her strong pro-abortion stance, given Donald Trump’s role in overturning Roe vs Wade .Trump chose his McDonald’s stint to coincide with Kamala Harris’ 60th birthday. During the gig, Trump appeared to have been doing this his entire life, the bankrupt billionaire looking like he had finally found his most natural habitat. Of course, Trump has always been fixated with McDonald’s, being a huge fan of the Big Mac and even greeting guests at the White House with fare from the Golden Arches.In its own way, McDonald’s is America, and Trump appeared to have morphed into Mr America in his red tie and golden hair. He joked with the owner (“How much are you paying me?”), before putting on the apron, working the French fry counter, and handing out a few bags of food to drive-in customers. The customers, carefully handpicked, included a black couple and an Indian-origin couple, clearly designed to show the new diverse MAGA that includes the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy.The fact is that McDonald’s isn’t just a fast-food chain; it’s an enduring symbol of American capitalism and everything great about it. It unifies beyond race, gender and creed, the North Star of the American story where any hardworking individual could – through grit and hard work – own a joint that fuels obesity and diabetes. There are nearly 14,000 McDonald’s outlets in America, and a 'like' from McDonald’s on social media is the American equivalent of a knighthood. They serve 25 million people a day, and 85% of the American population visits an outlet at least once a year. It’s also an enduring symbol of Americana across the world, and the fact that Russia had lost the Cold War was confirmed when the first McDonald’s opened in Moscow in 1990. Much like NASCAR or WWE, it’s an American institution that Donald Trump has been associated with for a very long time.After working for fifteen minutes, Trump announced that he had already worked at McDonald’s longer than Harris. Despite Harris’ claim to have worked at a McDonald’s on Central Avenue in Alameda, California during her freshman year at Howard University, the Harris campaign hasn’t been able to show an iota of proof that the event actually took place.There were no pay stubs or any sort of documentation, and the campaign has refused to let any friend or family member of Kamala Harris speak about her memories of her time at McDonald’s. Recently, the Nostradamus-like data analyst Nate Silver shared 24 reasons he believed Donald Trump could win. If he had seen Donald Trump’s performance at McDonald’s, he might have been tempted to add a 25th.Top 10 US Election Must Reads:","Kamala Harris has been going all out to prove she’s relatable, which has been a hard sell.

Trump and Harris get roasted and toasted as campaigns ignite passions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-and-harris-get-roasted-and-toasted-as-campaign-ignite-passions/articleshow/114433119.cms,"WASHINGTON: It was a day of drama, spectacle -- and roasts and toasts – in the US Presidential election campaign. Donald Trump jumped from the fryer into the fire as his attempt to troll Kamala Harris by visiting a McDonald's misfired. At the opposite end, Kamala Harris got baked when her effort to woo the Black Christian vote by visiting a church on her birthday was panned by MAGA faithful.The hashtag #McIdiot, promoted by Trump's niece Mary Trump among others, sizzled across social media as the MAGA supremo made a show of preparing french fries at a McDonald's -- except it turned out the outlet was closed for business to allow him to stage the event with handpicked supporters. That too at a franchise that had failed a health inspection in March.Critics were quick to note that Trump, a big fan of McDonald's and a self-professed germophobe, went straight to work without washing his hands. He wore an apron over his shirt and tie but did not wear gloves or a hairnet during his visit, asserting his hands were ""nice and clean.""The taunts that followed were biting. ""Oh the delicious irony of Trump pretending to work at a McDonald’s, considering that most franchisees have policies against hiring convicted felons,"" chirped one troll. A meme showed him asking a customer, ""Would you like lies with that?"" Another said ""It's like training for his job in the prison commissary.""""Perhaps no stunt in the history of U.S. politics deserves more ridicule than the grotesquely embarrassing mummery Trump put on at a Pennsylvania McDonald's today … The McDonald's was closed, the customers were fake, Trump did nothing."" Seth Abramson, a journalist and lawyer, wrote on X. And from Harris' running mate Tim Walz -- ""This guy spent decades stiffing workers pay, cut overtime benefits for millions of people, and opposed any effort to raise the minimum wage. You know who has actually worked at McDonald's, joined workers on picket lines, and fights for working people? @KamalaHarris.""Trump's MAGA followers meantime took aim at Harris' visit to a church in Atlanta to woo evangelical Christians, pointing to an episode the previous day where a protester who shouted ""Jesus in Lord"" was told ""You are at the wrong rally!"" ""You MOCK GOD in your Wisconsin rally and now you PANDER Christians in Church for votes? You are a FRAUD!"" steamed one Trump loyalist while others questioned the betrayal of liberal values of keeping church and politics apart.But at the rousing event, the congregation toasted Harris with a rendering of Stevie Wonder's Happy Birthday, as she urged them to vote as part of a nationwide drive known as "" souls to the polls ."" The push came amid polls showing her support from the young black male demographic has diminished, with some of it drifting towards Trump although she has majority support.Meanwhile, Trump also a facepalm from Peggy Palmer, the daughter of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, about whose manhood the MAGA megaphone had mused about at a campaign rally, when she said the MAGA man had taken a “poor choice of approach” towards remembering her father.She was more restrained in her criticism than in 2018, when she told The Sporting News that her dad, shortly before his death, had been “appalled” by Trump’s behavior during his 2016 presidential run. “My dad didn’t like people who act like they’re better than other people. He didn’t like it when people were nasty and rude. My dad had no patience for people who demean other people in public. He had no patience for people who are dishonest and cheat. He was appalled by Trump’s lack of civility and what he began to see as Trump’s lack of character.” she said.The multiple smackdowns and roasts did not appear to make the slightest difference to the candidates in pre-poll surveys: they showed them in a dead heat across the battleground states.","The hashtag #McIdiot sizzled across social media as the MAGA supremo made a show of preparing french fries at a McDonald's. At the opposite end, Kamala Harris got baked when her effort to woo the Black Christian vote by visiting a church on her birthday was panned by MAGA faithful.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114433436,imgsize-1716324,width-400,resizemode-4/114433436.jpg"

McDonald’s Corp . said it’s not taking sides in the presidential election following Donald Trump ’s visit to a Pennsylvania restaurant on Sunday.“McDonald’s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next president,” the company said in an internal message seen by Bloomberg News. “We are not red or blue — we are golden.”The burger chain has been dragged into the election conversation in part because candidate Kamala Harris has said she worked at the chain when she was a student.Trump’s visit — in which he cooked food, bagged fries and worked the drive-thru, according to his campaign — added more fuel to the discussion.In its message, McDonald’s said local franchisee Derek Giacomantonio got a request from law enforcement about Trump’s “desire to visit a Pennsylvania restaurant.”Pennsylvania is considered one of the key swing states that will determine the election. In an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last week, Trump singled it out as one of the states that he would be closely watching on election night.A perfectly executed order of fries from President Trump.“Upon learning of the former president’s request, we approached it through the lens of our core values: we open our doors to everyone,” McDonald’s said in its message.McDonald’s said franchisees — who independently own and operate more than 95 per cent of US locations — have also invited Harris and her running mate Tim Walz for a visit.Trump has sought to discredit, without evidence, Harris’ claim about her job at the Golden Arches in the 1980s. McDonald’s said that neither corporate nor franchisees have records for all positions going back to that time.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the message.","‘McDonald’s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next president,’ the company said in an internal message seen by Bloomberg News. ‘We are not red or blue — we are golden’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114432767,imgsize-1322325,width-400,resizemode-4/114432767.jpg"
