"'How do you plan to hold Senthil trial,' SC asks Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-do-you-plan-to-hold-senthil-trial-sc-asks-tamil-nadu/articleshow/123007329.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that trial in cash-for-job scam, in which former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji is being prosecuted, could be the most mammoth trial in the country with over 2,000 accused, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the state to place before it a prosecutorial plan on how to go about the case and said that it may consider appointing a special public prosecutor in the case.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the state to submit a complete list of accused and witnesses in the corruption cases and said ""with over 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses it will be the most populated trial of India. A small courtroom of the trial court will not suffice and a cricket stadium will be needed to even mark the presence of the accused.""It asked govt why it did not filter accused on the basis of their marginal or prime culpability in the case. It said that the bribe givers, though technically also committed a crime, are effectively victims and prosecuting such a large number of people would cause extreme inordinate delay.""We want to know what your prosecutorial plan is. It seems to be a very rudderless ship with 2,000 odd accused, 500 odd witnesses. How would you achieve clubbing? We gave a suggestion that you see the accused with regards to their degree of marginal culpability and prime culpability? Why should it come from us? This thought never crossed your prosecutor's mind?,"" the bench asked the state govt.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the complainants, said that the prosecution should identify the prime accused namely the minister, his brother, his personal assistant, and others who solicited bribes and rest be treated as witnesses.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, for the state govt, opposed the appointment of a special public prosecutor as the court had already rejected the prayer and told the court to hear him before making its mind on appointing SPP in the case. He said that there had been no allegations against the present public prosecutor who is discharging his duties.The bench, however, said that appointment of SPP would dispel any wrong public perception about the trial as a former minister and bureaucrats were involved in the case.""He is a powerful politician. Nothing wrong with being a powerful politician. Somebody who has public support. Only concern is that in a case where some person who has held the position of the minister there are some bureaucrats or other affluent people who are facing trial there is a public perception that a prosecution through the govt appointed public prosecutor may not alone be able to do justice,"" the bench said.",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the state to submit a complete list of accused and witnesses in the corruption cases.

Mystery over ghost litigant in SC deepens as 3rd lawyer distances himself from case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-over-ghost-litigant-in-sc-deepens-as-3rd-lawyer-distances-himself-from-case/articleshow/122984613.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mystery around a 'ghost litigant' in Supreme Court deepened further as the third lawyer whose name appeared in the order sheet for the litigant told the court Tuesday that he was not involved in any way in the case and did not know how his name cropped up. Suspecting the role of some outsider and not lawyers, the bar associations sought a police inquiry and forensic examination of documents to catch the culprit which the apex court agreed to consider.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant. Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC.The names of four lawyers were mentioned in the order out of which three are known names in the field of litigation but no one had heard of the fourth advocate. It came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party did not practice law any more and he and his daughter, whose name was also there, were not even aware of the case.The court, thereafter, directed the third lawyer to appear before it.Appearing before a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar, advocate Ratan Lal told the court that he did not do anything and he had nothing to do with the case. As all three lawyers refused their involvement in the case and the fourth lawyer remains untraced, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Supreme Court Advocates On-Record Association (SCAORA) told the bench that lawyers were not involved in the wrongdoing.SCAORA president Vipin Nair said an inquiry was needed in the case and who would conduct it was very important. ""The blame or charge of any wrongdoing can't be straightaway ascribed to AOR or lawyers since the pleadings indicate that the possibility of the petitioner engaging in fabrication can't be ruled out. A thorough enquiry is therefore necessary,"" Nair told the bench.It was also argued police should be asked to hold an inquiry. The court, after a brief hearing, said it would consider all aspects and pass an order. SC had in Dec passed the order after the 'compromise agreement' was placed before it and the order sheet of that day mentioned the names of the four advocates.",A litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner.

A woman collapsed beside the twin graves of Panakkadan Shajahan and his daughter Faiza as the cleric ended their death anniversary prayers. ""Poovi has fainted... It was too much for her,"" said an elderly relative as others rushed to help.Nearby lies the scattered grave of Shajahan's mother Panakkadan Jameela - buried across six different plots after her body was found in fragments. ""How can one find closure when she lies scattered like that?"" asked Mohammed Koya, kin to the Panakkadan family.One year has passed since a rain-triggered landslide on July 30 turned Chooralmala and Mundakkai into ghost villages in Kerala's Wayanad. Of the 298 confirmed dead or missing, 57 families were wiped out entirely, leaving no heirs to even claim the Rs 8 lakh ex gratia.Over 56 unidentified bodies and 213 body parts were interred at Puthumala burial ground - now a grim monument to nature's violence.At the epicentre, 5km away, crushed homes and debris line Punnapuzha's watery path. A year ago, the river carried down sludge, boulders, bodies, entire plantations over an 8km stretch.Today, wild elephants roam the abandoned gardens.Officials hailed the rehabilitation response as one of Kerala's largest, but gaps glare. Each affected person is eligible for Rs 2 lakh to rebuild their lives. Execution remained slow. Govt extended monthly support - Rs 6,000 in rent aid and Rs 9,000 in livelihood aid for up to two family members. A township is being built for the 402 most-affected families.But many remain outside the list. ""Govt has used a filtering-out method,"" said district panchayat president Shamshad Marakkar. ""Meppadi panchayat submitted a list of 545. The final list was cut to 402."" Despite Rs 772 crore collected in public contributions, only Rs 100 crore has been spent so far, he said.The ex gratia list revealed oversights. In Chooralmala, Vipin lost the house he had rented out. His name was excluded, while his tenants received compensation.The psychological toll remains immense. A post-disaster needs assessment of 1,231 people found over 35% reported trauma-related symptoms. Survivor Usman Bappu Koikkal suffers panic attacks during heavy rain. ""Even a motorcycle ignition makes my heart race,"" he said. ""I take three tablets a day just to stay stable.""Shopkeepers and small business owners have been left especially vulnerable. Losses run into crores. Govt offered no direct compensation. Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi stepped in with Rs 2.3 crore for 55 shopkeepers.Pookkattil Aboobacker, once among Chooralmala's wealthiest residents, now lives in a rented house near Muppainad, reliant on charity to support his 11-member family. He owned 11 rental shop units and plantation land, including a 2-acre cardamom plot. All of it now lies buried or abandoned. With dialysis thrice a week and Rs 14 lakh in unpaid loans, Aboobacker said: ""Now I depend on others to survive.""The fight is not against rubble - it's against time, fatigue and fading attention.

Indira 'literally begged' Nixon to intervene in '71 Pak war: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indira-literally-begged-nixon-to-intervene-in-71-pak-war-bjp/articleshow/123005957.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP Lok Sabha members on Wednesday raised questions over the conduct of former PM Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war with Pakistan, claiming she had ""literally begged"" then US President Richard Nixon's to intervene.In a letter to Speaker Om Birla, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey accused LoP Rahul Gandhi of using ""distorted and inaccurate facts"", a day after the Congress neta said if PM Modi had ""even 50% courage of Indira"", then he must announce that US President Trump is a liar and did not force the Operation Sindoor ""ceasefire"".Raising the issue in zero hour in LS, BJP member Anurag Thakur said Indian soldiers won the 1971 war but ""someone else"" was declared the ""Iron Lady"". He claimed the war was won on the battlefield but lost at the negotiation table.While Thakur flagged Indira's letter to Nixon on Dec 5, 1971, in the House, Dubey attached a copy of it in his letter to Birla.Thakur read out the letter, wherein Indira urged Nixon to persuade Pakistan to desist forthwith from the policy of wanton aggression and military adventurism. ""The nation has to decide whether the govt of that day was 'iron or an irony',"" he said, amid protests from Congress members.Urging Birla to reprimand Rahul for his ""habitual delinquency"" and highlighting the letter to Nixon, Dubey said, ""She had literally begged before him to use his influence to stop the war with Pakistan."" Rahul has once again ""unabashedly betrayed"" public trust by twisting well-documented historical facts, which has become his ""habit to glorify his family"", Dubey said.Thakur wondered whether Indira did not trust the armed forces and chose to plead with the US to halt the war.

"Pakistan, China in a tango due to Congress government's decisions: EAM Jaishankar in Rajya Sabha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-china-in-a-tango-due-to-congress-governments-decisions-eam-jaishankar-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/123005949.cms,"NEW DELHI: EAM S Jaishankar Wednesday took a swipe at Congress netas pretending to have expertise on India's bilateral ties with China, calling them ""China gurus"" while countering their claims that Pakistan and China have come closer in recent years. He said the two have come close over decades as earlier Congress regimes left the land of POK between them.Intervening during the discussion on Operation Sindoor in Rajya Sabha, Jaishankar dismissed opposition's questions on whether US President Trump brokered the ceasefire, saying there was no call between PM Modi and Trump between April 22 and June 16. The ceasefire was announced on May 10. He also said the halt to military action was not linked to trade, as Trump claimed.Countering claims made by Rahul Gandhi that Pakistan and China are working as a nexus, the EAM said the countries are in a tango because of the decisions taken during Congress's governance. ""There are China gurus now, one is an honourable member sitting across me (Jairam Ramesh). His affection for China was so much he conjoined India and China - Chindia. There is another China guru (referring to Rahul),"" the minister said. The term Chindia was used by Ramesh in his book 'Making Sense of Chindia: Reflections on China and India'.""China gurus say Pakistan and China have close ties; that is true. But how did they come close? It was because in the middle, we had left POK.This has been happening since 1962 and 1963. In 1963, Pakistan gave Shaksgam Valley to China. Karakoram highway's planning started in 1967 and finished in 1986. You know whose govt was there. Military cooperation between Pakistan and China happened in 1967 and nuclear collaboration happened in 1976, and they make it appear that all this has happened overnight. ..,"" the EAM said.Jaishankar drew a comparison between how past govts and Modi regime responded to terrorism . Months after the blasts in Mumbai trains (July 2006), he said, there was a meeting in Havana in Sept where an agreement was signed between PMs of India and Pakistan. ""Instead of holding Pakistan responsible, we said we condemn all acts of terrorism and agree it's a scourge that needs to be dealt with and by the way we will resume our composite dialogue... You were equating the perpetrator and victim,"" he said. Referring to the 26/11 attack in Mumbai in 2008, Jaishankar said in July 2009, at a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, it was agreed that terrorism was the main threat to ""both countries"".""After a gruesome terror attack, they were ready for dialogue.

When is Gilbert Arenas' trial scheduled?

Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas is firing back just hours after being released from federal custody. The 43-year-old, known as “Agent Zero” during his playing days, was arrested Wednesday in connection with an alleged illegal gambling ring based out of a Los Angeles mansion. After pleading not guilty in court, Arenas walked free and wasted no time in reclaiming the spotlight as he shared a video of himself dancing, apparently captured by his wife, Melli Monaco.Moments after regaining his freedom, Gilbert Arenas took to his X, showing his unbothered face with a dancing move. “I’m back on the streets 🗣️ This ain’t got shyt to do with me — just rented the house. Wasn’t apart,” he wrote alongside a video of himself dancing confidently down a flight of outdoor stairs.He followed that up with a meme showing someone jumping out of a coffin and dancing, captioned simply, “THEY CAN’T HOLD ME.”The case, however, is no laughing matter. Arenas was one of six individuals indicted for allegedly organizing high-stakes poker games at a rented home in Encino, California. According to federal prosecutors, the operation ran between September 2021 and July 2022 and included everything from collecting a “rake” off each hand played, to hiring young women to serve drinks, offer massages, and provide “companionship” to gamblers.Federal documents list three charges against Arenas, conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business, operating an illegal gambling business, and making false statements to investigators. Prosecutors claim Arenas knew about the games, despite telling federal agents he was unaware. Court filings also mention custom poker felts printed with his name and image, reading “ARENAS POKER CLUB.”The indictment paints a picture of a full-scale operation, complete with chefs, valets, and armed security. One of the co-defendants, Yevgeni Gershman, is described as a suspected organized crime figure from Israel. Authorities allege that Gershman was responsible for hiring staff and collecting a “tax” from women working the games.Despite the serious nature of the case, Arenas and his lawyer are holding firm. “He is presumed innocent, right?” said defense attorney Jerome Friedberg outside the courthouse. “He has the same right as any other citizen to that presumption.”Further details on his release await.Also Read: Who is Gilbert Arenas’ wife Melli Monaco?

Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000.

Minnesota called in the National Guard after a “deliberate, coordinated, digital attack” hit the city of St Paul, severely disrupting public services and forcing a complete shutdown of municipal information systems.St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter confirmed during a press conference on Tuesday that the city had initiated a full shutdown of its information systems as a defensive measure to contain the threat posed by the cyberattack, Reuters reported. The move triggered WiFi outages across city buildings, disrupted services in libraries, and suspended network resources.“While these disruptions are difficult, they are necessary steps to limit exposure, preserve system integrity, and protect sensitive information,” Carter stated.The office of governor Tim Walz said in a statement that the National Guard was being deployed because the scale of the cyberattack had ""exceeded the city's response capacity."" The Guard includes a cyber protection component, which is now supporting local efforts to deal with the crisis.Army Brigadier General Simon Schaefer of the Minnesota National Guard confirmed, “The Minnesota National Guard is providing cyber protection support at the request of the city.”Though the precise nature of the attack has not been disclosed, the pattern bears similarities to ransomware operations, where hackers typically deploy data-scrambling software to paralyse systems until a ransom is paid.Mayor Carter said two firms had been brought in to support the city’s response, although he did not name them. He also confirmed that the city is working closely with the FBI.An FBI spokesperson told Reuters, “We are working with partners and lending our investigative expertise.” The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has referred all questions to the city of St Paul.","Minnesota called in the National Guard after a “deliberate, coordinated, digital attack’ St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter confirmed that the city had initiated a full shutdown of its information systems as a defensive measure.

Kamala Harris Makes A Fiery Comeback; 'Mr. Trump, White House Is Not Yours...' | Watch





Former US Vice President Kamala Harris announced Wednesday that she will not run for California governor in 2026, ending months of speculation about her potential bid for the state’s top office. Her decision opens the door for other opportunities, including a possible presidential run in 2028.“In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their Governor. I love this state, its people, and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election,” Harris said in a statement.The decision may give her more flexibility to pursue a possible presidential run in 2028, though she has not confirmed any plans. She said she will share “more details in the months ahead” about her future.Harris didn’t shy away from addressing the current political climate, highlighting the need for fresh ideas to tackle what she called a “moment of crisis.”“Our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people,” she said. “As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking—committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook.”The announcement follows months of Harris reflecting on how best to serve the Democratic Party after her loss in the 2024 presidential election. “I am a devout public servant,” she said, “and from the earliest days of my career, I believed the best way to make a difference was to improve the system from within.” She pointed to her long public service record—as a prosecutor, attorney general of California, US senator, and Vice President—as evidence of her commitment.Though she won’t be running for governor, Harris has been steadily re-engaging in politics lately. She made virtual appearances at a youth voter summit and an abortion rights advocacy event.Meanwhile, her Harris Victory Fund has started fundraising to support former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s Senate campaign, signaling her ongoing influence within the party.Despite stepping back from the gubernatorial race, Harris promised she won’t step away from the fight for “freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all.”“I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans,” she said in her statement.","Former US Vice President Kamala Harris announced Wednesday that she will not run for California governor in 2026.

What Democrats are demanding





Senate Democrats are using a little-known federal law to demand the department of justice hand over all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein—intensifying pressure on the Trump administration to provide full transparency in the disgraced financier’s criminal case and alleged network of high-profile connections.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced the move Wednesday on the Senate floor, saying Democrats are determined to obtain what he called the “full and complete Epstein files.”At the center of this push is Section 2954, or the “Rule of Five,” a rarely invoked statute from 1928 that allows five members of a Senate oversight committee to compel executive agencies—like the DOJ or FBI—to provide information, even without the chairman’s approval. Though seldom used, the law gives minority members significant oversight power.""Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,” Schumer said, as reported by CBS News.The Democrats’ push comes amid renewed public attention to Epstein’s case. A recent DOJ internal review claimed there is no “client list” and found no evidence Epstein blackmailed any powerful figures, findings that were met with widespread skepticism, particularly among Donald Trump ’s supporters.However, the issue has created divisions within Trump’s base, while figures from both parties have called for greater transparency. President Trump has dismissed the controversy as a ""hoax,"" but Democrats have used the internal GOP tension to their political advantageSchumer directly accused Trump of failing to follow through on promises. ""The situation with the Epstein files is very simple- Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,"" Schumer said. ""As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so,"" he added, as quoted by CBS News.He also challenged Republicans, “If there’s nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?”Under Section 2954, the request covers all DOJ and FBI documents, files, evidence, or other materials related to United States v Jeffrey Epstein- including anything referencing Epstein’s clients. Democrats emphasized that the privacy of victims would be protected.The DOJ has been given an August 15 deadline to respond.While Section 2954 has legal standing, it’s unclear how enforceable it is in court if the DOJ declines to comply. Democrats have used it in the past, most notably in 2017 to seek Trump Hotel lease records and in 2001 regarding US census data.",Senate Democrats are using a little-known federal law to demand the department of justice hand over all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. The push comes amid renewed public attention to Epstein’s case. A recent DOJ internal review claimed there is no “client list” and found no evidence Epstein blackmailed any powerful figures.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123004956,imgsize-1342115,width-400,resizemode-4/123004956.jpg"

FBI linked to Russia narrative before probe

Congressional review underway





FBI director Kash Patel has uncovered a hidden room inside FBI headquarters containing multiple “burn bags” filled with thousands of sensitive and classified documents—some related to the origins of the Trump–Russia probe, according to sources cited by Fox News. The burn bag system is used to destroy documents designated as classified or higher.Among the documents was the classified annex to former special counsel John Durham’s final report, which includes key intelligence that could shed new light on the FBI’s role in launching the controversial Crossfire Hurricane investigation.Declassification is being coordinated by CIA director John Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, attorney general Pam Bondi, and acting NSA director William Hartman. Once declassified, the document will be sent to senate judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley, who plans to make it public.Sources revealed that the annex contains credible foreign intelligence indicating the FBI may have played a role in advancing the Trump–Russia collusion narrative even before launching the Crossfire Hurricane probe. With hindsight, the sources claim the intelligence predicted the bureau’s actions “with alarming specificity.”Soon after assuming leadership at the FBI, Patel discovered the unknown sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) and initiated review of its contents. He told podcast host Joe Rogan that the room, hidden under former FBI director James Comey, was “full of documents and computer hard drives that no one had ever seen or heard of,"" as reported by Fox News.Patel has promised a wave of transparency, saying he would release “truckloads” of files related to politically sensitive investigations. He accused former FBI leaders of hiding documentation in secret areas to avoid scrutiny.Patel has turned the documents over to senator Grassley, who is now reviewing the materials. The release of the classified annex and supporting evidence may support Republican claims that intelligence officials sought to influence the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton by targeting Trump’s campaign.","FBI director Kash Patel has uncovered a hidden room inside FBI headquarters containing thousands of sensitive and classified documents.

Fiercest Senate Clash Between Democrats As Klobuchar Slams Booker’s Protest





Eric Trump, the second son of US President Donald Trump , on Wednesday suggested that someone from the Trump family could “certainly” run for president one day, though whether they would actually pursue it remains uncertain.In an interview with BBC Sport's Dan Roan, Eric was asked if the Trump family could become the next political dynasty in the United States, following in the footsteps of families like the Kennedys, Clintons, and Bushes.""People have asked me to. People have suggested I would. The answer is I very much doubt I would even consider it in 2028,"" he responded.He cited the personal and political toll his family has faced. He described the political environment as harsh and relentless, saying the experience had deeply affected them- especially his father.""I’ve got a great company. I’ve got young kids. Politics is brutal. They put us through hell. They tried to bankrupt us. They tried to put my father in jail. They tried to indict him. They tried to smear him. They made up Russia hoaxes, which were nonsense as everybody knows. They tried to impeach him. They tried to take him off ballots. They tried to censor his free speech. They pulled him off every channel,” he said as quoted by BBC.“And listen, you know they tried to kill him twice this year right?""When asked whether Donald Trump would like to see one of his family members run for office in the future, Eric replied, ""So you asked, could we, and I think the answer is somebody in the family? Certainly.”Eric said that, like his father, members of the Trump family might consider running for office only if circumstances became extremely difficult and left them with no other choice.Eric also highlighted the depth of talent within the Republican Party, emphasising that the party has strong leaders who can continue the Trump legacy beyond the family. He specifically mentioned Vice President JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio as capable figures, expressing confidence that they could uphold the values and vision associated with his father’s presidency, even if the next candidate is not a family member.He added, ""I think there’s tremendous amount of great people out there. I think JD Vance would do a great job. I think Marco Rubio would do a great job. We have real talent in the Republican Party in the US and I think they can certainly continue my father's legacy outside of our family.""In June, Eric Trump hinted that the Trump family has not ruled out the possibility of building a political dynasty, with himself or other relatives potentially running for office. Speaking to the Financial Times, he said pursuing a political career would be “easy” for family members once his father’s second term ends in 2029. However, he added, “The real question is: ‘Do you want to drag other members of your family into it?’”","Eric Trump, the second son of US President Donald Trump, on Wednesday suggested that someone from the Trump family could “certainly” run for president one day.

Nebraska plant explosion: Three dead after blast at biofuels facility; fire continues to grow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nebraska-plant-explosion-three-dead-after-blast-at-biofuels-facility-fire-continues-to-grow/articleshow/123001047.cms,"Firefighters hampered by structural collapse at biofuel plant (Image: AP)





Three people, including two kids, who remained unaccounted for following a powerful explosion at a biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, were confirmed dead Wednesday. The blast occurred midday at Horizon Biofuels, a facility that produces fuel pellets and animal bedding. The explosion caused a large fire and significant structural collapse, making it too dangerous for crews to enter and search for the dead.""When we arrived on scene, we had heavy smoke and a lot of flames coming out,"" Fremont Fire Chief Todd Bernt said at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon as reported by AP. ""We had a lot of structural collapse.""Three people were inside the building at the time of the explosion, Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg confirmed. ""But that's all we could say at this point,"" he said.Spellerberg said the two children were waiting for the employee to get off work so they could go to a doctor’s appointment. He wasn't sure of their exact ages but said both were under age 12.The collapse severely limited rescue efforts.""Early on, we tried to get access, but just due to the collapse with the mangled steel, we were unable to get inside,"" Bernt said.The fire remains active as of Wednesday, especially in the facility’s tower.Bernt said crews are expected to remain on site for several days. The plant contains large quantities of wood and alcohol-based materials, which have contributed to the fire’s intensity.The Fremont Fire Department called in Nebraska Task Force One to assess how to safely conduct a search. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, and the Nebraska State Fire Marshal’s Office is among several agencies responding.Horizon Biofuels has a history of fire-related incidents. In 2014, a fire at the same building damaged its electrical system but left the structure intact, according to the Fremont Tribune.""It's quite incredible to see the work, and we're doing everything we can with this situation,"" Mayor Spellerberg said, praising the coordinated emergency response.Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen also said he is closely monitoring the situation.""Our thoughts and prayers are with all involved -- and we're ready to help any way we can,"" Pillen said in a statement.A woman who came to the scene to hand out water to first responders described seeing a ""large black puff of smoke"" after the explosion.""I was just instantly praying that nobody was hurt,"" she told reporters. ""That's all we can hope for. We're a good community. Everybody will rally together and help each other.""Fremont, a city of about 27,000 residents, is located roughly 32 miles (52 kilometers) northwest of Omaha.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market.
