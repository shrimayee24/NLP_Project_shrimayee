Premeditated crime

Muskan Rastogi , accused of murdering and dismembering her husband, Saurabh Rajput, spent her first night in Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail in extreme distress, as per reports. She was placed in the women’s barrack while her lover and co-accused, Sahil Shukla, was lodged separately in the men’s section.According to senior jail superintendent Viresh Raj Sharma, Muskan remained completely silent upon arrival and refused to eat. Jail sources told news agency PTI that Muskan cried throughout the night. Both accused had reportedly requested to be housed in adjacent barracks, but their request was denied.Also read: How Muskan lured lover Sahil to murder ex-merchant navy officer Saurabh Rajput ""Muskan remained silent and did not interact with anyone. She also did not eat the provided food,"" Sharma said.Earlier on Wednesday, Muskan and Sahil were presented in the court of the chief judicial magistrate and remanded to 14-day judicial custody. Their court appearance turned chaotic when a group of enraged lawyers physically assaulted them outside the courtroom. Sahil's clothes were torn in the scuffle before police managed to intervene and escort them to safety.The dismembered body of Saurabh Rajput, which was found encased in cement inside a blue drum, was cremated late Wednesday evening after undergoing a post-mortem examination.Investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil had a long-standing relationship, having reconnected in 2019 through a WhatsApp group of former schoolmates.

The couple then stabbed him to death before dismembering his body in an attempt to dispose of the evidence.They initially planned to discard the body parts in different locations but later opted to seal them inside a plastic drum filled with cement and sand. Before executing their plan, Muskan ensured her six-year-old daughter was sent to her grandmother’s house.After the murder, the couple travelled to Himachal Pradesh, attempting to evade suspicion. However, upon their return to Meerut on March 17, Saurabh’s family lodged a missing person complaint, leading to police action. Investigators uncovered inconsistencies in Muskan’s statements, and during interrogation, she and Sahil confessed to the crime. The blue drum containing Saurabh’s remains was subsequently recovered from their residence.Muskan’s parents expressed deep remorse over their daughter’s actions. Her father, Pramod Rastogi, insisted that she and Sahil deserved the death penalty. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to walk the earth,” he said.","Muskan Rastogi, accused of murdering and dismembering her husband, spent her first night in Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail in extreme distress.

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput has sent shockwaves through Meerut, with his grieving family demanding the death penalty for his wife, Muskan Rastogi , and her alleged lover, Sahil Shukla. Saurabh’s mother, Renu Devi, accused Muskan of killing her husband, locking his body in a room, and then going on a trip as if nothing had happened.Saurabh had been missing since March 4. The horrific crime was exposed when laborers hired to move a heavy drum from the couple’s rented house struggled with its weight. When one of them questioned Muskan about its contents, she casually said it was ""house junk."" However, as they attempted to shift it, the lid accidentally opened, releasing a foul smell. Suspecting something sinister, the laborers immediately informed the police.According to Saurabh’s mother, even their young daughter might have been aware of the crime. “Neighbors told us that she (their daughter) was saying, ‘Papa has been kept in the drum.’ She might have seen something, or else why would a child say such a thing?” Renu Devi said.Police investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil allegedly stabbed Saurabh to death, chopped up his body, and sealed the remains in a drum filled with cement to hide the crime. Muskan’s landlord had reportedly asked the couple to vacate the rented house, which is when she and Sahil attempted to shift the body.After the body was discovered, Muskan fled to her mother’s house, allegedly to inform them of what had happened. However, Saurabh’s mother claims Muskan’s family already knew about the murder. “She (Muskan) reached her mother’s house, and her mother met a lawyer before they went to court. They were trying to cover things up, but the police caught them,” Renu Devi said.Police arrested Muskan and Sahil on Tuesday and presented them before the court on Wednesday. They have been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.Meanwhile, Saurabh’s family is devastated, claiming he sacrificed everything for Muskan, only to be betrayed in the most gruesome manner. “Saurabh left his job and family for Muskan, but she took his life,” his parents said.Renu Devi recalled how Saurabh had distanced himself from his family after marrying Muskan. “I tolerated everything for the happiness of my son and daughter-in-law. Now, she has killed my son.”The grieving mother, overwhelmed with grief, demanded strict punishment. “They all (Muskan’s family) should be hanged along with that boy (Sahil),” she said.Meanwhile, Muskan’s own parents have disowned her, expressing deep remorse over her actions. “It would have been better if she was never born,” her mother, Kavita Rastogi, told reporters.Her father, Pramod Rastogi, called for the harshest punishment. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to be alive. She fell in love with Sahil and got addicted to drugs. He destroyed her. She lost 10 kg because of drug use. But that does not justify this crime,” he said.Pramod and Kavita said that they fully support Saurabh’s family’s demand for justice. They confirmed that Muskan had been living separately from her in-laws since her marriage in 2016 due to ongoing disputes.","Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput was stabbed to death.

But Monday night's riots epicentre Mahal remained under heavy security. Police arrested 17 more suspects and detained four minors for stone-throwing, bringing the total in custody to 95. Fahim Khan , a burqa seller accused of masterminding the violence, was charged with two cases of sedition. He was arrested Tuesday and remanded in police custody. He is expected to be transferred to the cyber cell for further investigation.Police alleged that he spread inflammatory content through viral videos in the hours leading up to the riots. ""Khan proactively shared his inflammatory video, which propagated hate against another community and police,"" said cyber cell DCP Lohit Matani.Khan had led a protest to Ganeshpeth police station Monday, filing a complaint against Bajrang Dal and VHP members for burning an effigy of Aurangzeb and a religious chadar during the day. Shortly after leaving, he posted a video blaming police for shielding the demonstrators. The video quickly went viral, which authorities claim incited the violence in Mahal Gate, a neighbourhood just 2km from the RSS headquarters.Police sources said Khan's video gained traction online, fuelling tensions and helping mobilise a stone-throwing mob. Cyber investigators alleged that a 250-member "" troll army "" played a key role in spreading inflammatory content.""We have zeroed in on more than 50 users and sent out police teams to nab them by midnight,"" Matani said. More than 90 provocative posts were shared from 34 accounts in a short span and before authorities could take them down, they had gone viral.Some of the posts were allegedly doctored to escalate tensions.

“Deal very shortly…”, Prez Trump shares major update on mineral deal | Ukraine-Russia Peace Deal

US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the US would be finalising an agreement with Ukraine regarding access to its rare earth minerals.During his White House speech, Trump confirmed signing a directive to ""dramatically increase"" US production of critical minerals and indicated an imminent agreement with Ukraine.""We're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock rare earths and minerals and lots of other things all over the world, but in particular Ukraine,"" he said. Confirming the intention to sign the deal, trump added, ""One of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths with Ukraine, which they have tremendous value in rare earths, and we appreciate that.""Trump has been urging his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to establish economic agreements to balance American support in Ukraine's defence against Russian invasion.He specifically targeted Ukraine's mineral resources. The country possesses five percent of global mineral deposits, including iron, manganese, titanium, lithium and uranium.Although Ukraine has deposits of ""rare earths"", which comprise 17 specific metals within the broader critical minerals category, none are currently under commercial extraction, as reported by AFP .Last month, Zelenskyy refused to approve an agreement allowing US mining companies access to mineral developments, citing inadequate protection against continued Russian military actions. Nevertheless, Trump has maintained his advocacy for a temporary cessation of hostilities.The proposed critical mineral deal between the US and Ukraine aims to grant the US access to Ukraine’s vast reserves of essential minerals like titanium and lithium, crucial for industries such as artificial intelligence, defense, and clean energy. Under the agreement, Ukraine would contribute 50% of revenues from newly developed mineral assets, oil, and natural gas into a joint investment fund to attract private sector investment and aid in Ukraine’s reconstruction.The deal collapsed during a February meeting at the White House after tensions flared between Trump and Zelenskyy. Trump pressured Zelenskyy to secure US access to these resources in exchange for continued military aid, while Zelenskyy pushed for explicit security guarantees—something the deal did not provide. A heated exchange in the Oval Office led to Zelenskyy’s early departure without signing the agreement, cancelling the planned press conference and signing ceremony. The breakdown underscored Trump’s prioritization of resource access over unconditional support, straining US-Ukraine relations amid the ongoing war with Russia.Read more: How Trump-Vance-Zelenskyy dispute led to the collapse of a critical mineral deal",US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the US would be finalising an agreement with Ukraine regarding access to its rare earth minerals.

FBI shares tips for travelers to stay safe over spring break



Establish points of contact for your family to reference in the event of an emergency.

Avoid traveling alone, especially after dark. Be conscious of your surroundings and avoid areas you believe may put your personal safety at risk.

Use only authorized taxis/shuttles. Passengers have been robbed or kidnapped when using taxis.

Avoid actions that are illegal, improper, or indiscreet. Avoid offers of sexual companionship; they may lead to a room raid, photography, and blackmail.

Evade criminals by being aware of your surroundings and alert to the possibility of surveillance. Take mental notes of anyone following you and promptly report it to the appropriate security officials.

Beware of new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.

Was there any foul play in Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance?



As 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki 's disappearance from a beach in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic remains a mystery, FBI Los Angeles has warned spring break travelers to take certain precautions and be extra vigilant while travelling. Virginia's Konanki went to DR on a vacation from where she mysteriously disappeared with officials initially thinking that she drowned. Her body was not found to date.The case came to a heartbreaking conclusion with Konanki's parents urging the DR officials to declare her officially dead so that they could move on with their lives, grieve and respect the memories of Konanki.FBI Los Angeles told travelers to check the State Department's travel advisories — about security threats overseas. ""Whether it’s families looking to escape the final throes of winter or a college student seeking a brief respite from the rigors of academic life, know that the risks are there,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis said in a statement. ""Maintain vigilance throughout your travels and be prepared to contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate should the need arise.""In the Caribbean, Haiti has the highest and level 4 travel advisory, meaning ""do not travel,"" followed by Jamaica at level 3, which means US citizens should ""reconsider travel.""Sudiksha's parents initially suspected foul play and insisted that she could not drown. Joshua Riibe, a 24-year-old man from Iowa, who was last seen with Konanki was detained and questioned. He said he went to the sea with Konanki when they were caught in strong waves. He fought against the waves and pulled Konanki out of the rough waters and then passed out on the shores. He said when he woke up in the morning, Konanki was not there. Konanki's parents now believe Riibe was not involved in any foul play and they thanked him for cooperation in the probe following which Riibe was allowed to come back home from DR.",FBI shares tips for travelers to stay safe over spring break. 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance from a beach in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic remains a mystery.

JD Vance Kamala Harris: JD Vance says he doesn't have 'four shots of vodka' before every meeting unlike Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-says-he-doesnt-have-four-shots-of-vodka-before-every-meeting-unlike-kamala-harris/articleshow/119265773.cms,"JD Vance jokes that unlike Kamala Harris, he does not have 'four shots of vodka' before meetings.

Vice President JD Vance confirmed what has been there in the form of rumors, trolling and speculations that former vice president Kamala Harris was always 'high as a kite'. However, JD Vance's statement also came in the form of a joke when he was asked how he does things differently from his predecessor. ""Well, I don’t have four shots of vodka before every meeting,” Vance laughed in an interview with radio host and Daily Caller editorial director Vince Coglianese.“That’s one way that I think Kamala really tried to bring herself into the role, is these word salads,” Vance added, “and I think that I would need the help of a lot of alcohol to answer a question like Kamala Harris answered a question.”Apart from her 'word salads' which are a collection of high-sounding words strung together signifying nothing, Kamala Harris is often trolled for the singsong tone in which she speaks which people think is because of her alleged day drinking problem. Several of her appearances struck social media users as being 'drunk' though there is no report confirming any type of alcohol abuse the former vice president may have had.In one of her interviews during the campaigning, Kamala Harris cracked open a Miller High Life beer can with Stephen Colbert which was seen as a cool gesture for a presidential nominee as Joe Biden and Donald Trump are known to be teetotallers.JD Vance too was seen drinking a beer with supporters during the campaigning. He said he liked beer a little bit too much.Kamala Harris' latest public appearance was at an AI conference where she talked about innovation but ended up talking about her famous Doritos with DoorDash serving as the innovation link.“We did DoorDash ’cause I wanted Doritos. And the red carpet part was about to start and nobody wanted to leave to go to the grocery store. So it was DoorDash … So I was willing to give up whatever might be the tracking of Kamala Harris’ particular fondness for nacho cheese Doritos for the sake of getting a big bag of Doritos as I watched the Oscars,” she began.“And that’s right. But here’s the thing: At what point do we also uplift and highlight the consumer’s right to also expect — and you can debate with me if it should be a right — I think it should,” Harris said making many to believe that she was three glasses of wines deep.","JD Vance confirmed what has been there in the form of rumors, trolling and speculations that former vice president Kamala Harris was always 'high as a kite' However, JD Vance's statement also came in the forms of a joke when he was asked how he does things differently from his predecessor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119265860,imgsize-719552,width-400,resizemode-4/119265860.jpg"

Joshua back home, Konanki's body still not found



The father of Joshua Riibe who was called a 'person of interest' in the highly sensational disappearance case of Sudiksha Konanki was seen flustered as Joshua was detained in Puerto Rico on his way home from Dominican Republic to Iowa. “I’m just a dad, who had his son taken away, and I don’t understand, we just spent two weeks trying to stay together, and now … I don’t understand,” Riibe's father complained.According to reports, Joshua Riibe was allowed to leave the Dominican Republic after Sudiksha Konanki's parents appealed to the DR authorities to declare Konanki dead. They said they believed that Riibe was not involved in any foul play and that Konanki was indeed drowned in the ocean. They appealed for Riibe's release as well and thanked him for his cooperation in the probe.Reports said Joshua was detained in the airport as his newly replaced US passport did not have the correct stamp on it.Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Pittsburg University student, went to the Dominican Republic on a vacation with her friends. She mysteriously disappeared after being seen last with Riibe whom she met at the resort. Riibe told police that he had gone to the ocean with Konanki and that they had been caught in huge waves against which he battled and pulled Konanki to the shore.Joshua asserted that Konanki was with him when he reached the shore but was not there the next morning when he woke up. He thought Konanki went to the resort. Konanki's clothes were found on the beach.The case became sensational after Konanki's parents initially ruled out drowning and suspected foul play. Both Konanki and Riibe were evidently drunk when they went to the ocean. Riibe told the cops that they kissed in the water when they were caught in high waves.","Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Pittsburg University student, went to the Dominican Republic on a vacation with her friends.

"Karnataka Bandh: March 22 Karnataka bandh is on, say some pro-Kannada outfits",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/march-22-karnataka-bandh-is-on-say-some-pro-kannada-outfits/articleshow/119174535.cms,"Pro-Kannada organisations led by Vatal Nagaraj have confirmed a 6am-to-6pm bandh on Saturday, protesting the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill and recent incidents in Belagavi.

Cab drivers and some autorickshaw unions have confirmed participation, meaning no Ola/Uber cabs and limited autos. State transport employees (KSRTC, NWKRTC, BMTC) are yet to decide.

The SSLC exam schedule remains unchanged, and private unaided schools will continue exams for lower classes despite moral support for the bandh. The TA Narayana Gowda faction has refused to support the bandh, arguing that it affects people's livelihoods and preferring alternative forms of protest.

The bandh highlights concerns over Bengaluru’s governance restructuring, outsider influx, employment issues, and language disputes, including the Belagavi bus conductor assault and governor’s Hindi speech.

BENGALURU: A section of pro-Kannada organisations on Tuesday asserted they were going ahead with their call to observe a Karnataka Bandh Saturday.The announcement on the 6am-to-6pm bandh comes as exam season is picking up. However, no SSLC exam that begins Friday has been scheduled for Saturday. A schools' association said they would go ahead with exams for lower classes on that day in the interest of students.While a cab drivers' association said they won't ply Saturday, road transport corporation employees said they will take a call in a day or two. Some autorickshaw drivers said they will participate in the bandh.Vatal Nagaraj, leader of pro-Kannada organisations that have called the bandh, said the protest is against the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill and the atmosphere created in Belagavi region by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, where an NWKRTC bus conductor was attacked recently for not speaking in Marathi to a passenger.However, the Kannada Rakshana Vedike faction headed by TA Narayana Gowda said it will stay away from the protest. ""We never believe in protests. Rather we believe in focusing on problems and trying to solve them or fighting for the same. Yes, we're very disappointed with the Belagavi assault and GBG Bill, but we can't really support a full-day protest as it will affecting the earnings of people. So, we are not extending our support to the bandh,"" Gowda explained.But Vatal Nagaraj said: ""We are disappointed with Bengaluru being divided into four to seven parts. We are not going to cancel the bandh. We have support from over 2,000 Kannada activists. People are saying it will affect their livelihood if we have a bandh for one day, but what about things that are affecting us every day? This fight is not for me but for people in the state.""He said other issues of concern include the governor delivering his speech in Hindi, Kannadigas not getting adequate employment in the IT/BT sector, and the increasing influx of outsiders into Bengaluru.N Ashok Kumar, vice-president, Ola Uber Drivers' and Owners' Association, said, ""We fully support the bandh call. We are facing huge losses because of bike taxis. Where should we go for work when outsiders take over our livelihood? No cabs will ply on the road Saturday.""B Jayadev Raje Urs, convener of Joint Action Committee Unions, KSRTC, said, ""We always extend moral support to protests. The Belagavi assault is not at all acceptable, mainly because we are public servants. As of now, we have not really decided to stop bus services. We have to think about public convenience... we will hold a meeting soon and decide.""D Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Private Unaided Schools in Karnataka, said, ""We want to participate in the protest, but we can only extend moral support as of now due to ongoing exams across the state. Cancelling or postponing them will affect children... which we don't want to happen.""""We are supporting the bandh and our members won't operate that day. All our 20,000 drivers will join the bandh.

'Fishing expedition': US Judge limits Elon Musk-led DOGE's access to social security system data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fishing-expedition-us-judge-limits-elon-musk-led-doges-access-to-social-security-system-data/articleshow/119280914.cms,"People protest against DOGE access to Social security data

A federal judge has temporarily blocked Elon Musk and members of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive records within the Social Security Administration ’s (SSA) systems, citing privacy concerns.The directive requires the team to eliminate any personally identifiable information they currently possess.US District Judge Ellen Hollander determined that the team received extensive access to sensitive Social Security Administration data without adequate justification for their fraud investigation . ""The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion,"" she stated.""To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so,"" Hollander further wrote.The directive permits DOGE staff to access redacted data without personal identifiers, provided they complete training and security clearances.The current administration maintains DOGE addresses federal government inefficiencies. Musk has particularly scrutinised Social Security, labelling it a ""ponzi scheme"" and advocating waste reduction as crucial for decreasing government expenditure.The decision, subject to appeal, stems from legal action by unions, pensioners and Democracy Forward. They contended that DOGE's access violates privacy regulations and poses security risks. A former Social Security official's testimony expressed serious concerns about data protection.Court documents reveal DOGE deployed ten federal employees at SSA, with seven granted read-only access to agency systems or personal information. The government argued these federal employees were legally permitted to access data under privacy laws, with no evidence of improper information sharing. The Justice Department maintained that DOGE's access aligned with standard agency practices of database searching.However, the plaintiffs' lawyers termed this access unprecedented. Lee Saunders, AFSCME president, celebrated the ruling as beneficial for workers and retirees nationwide. Democracy Forward's president, Skye Perryman, commended the court's recognition of DOGE's concerning actions.Meanwhile, DOGE has reportedly accessed other government databases, including Treasury and IRS systems. At SSA, DOGE staff arrived shortly after the inauguration, seeking rapid access to restricted data systems, according to a former official's court testimony.Tiffany Flick, former acting chief of staff, indicated the team's fraud investigation was based on misunderstandings.Judge Hollander, 75, based in Baltimore and appointed by President Obama, joins other judges in reviewing DOGE cases. The initiative faces numerous lawsuits. Recently, another Maryland judge ruled DOGE's USAID restructuring likely unconstitutional.","US District Judge Ellen Hollander determined that the team received extensive access to sensitive Social Security Administration data without adequate justification for their fraud investigation.

This marked the first time that the US had turned down such a request under the 1944 treaty that governed water allocation from the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers.The requested water would have gone to Tijuana, a major border city heavily reliant on the Colorado River. However, the US state department justified its decision by pointing to Mexico’s failure to meet its obligations under the treaty, which operates on five-year cycles. The current cycle ends in October 2025.Mexico has fallen behind in its water payments due to drought conditions in the arid north of the country, as per the Guardian.""Mexico's continued shortfalls in its water deliveries under the 1944 water-sharing treaty are decimating American agriculture-- particularly farmers in the Rio Grande valley,"" the state department’s Latin America bureau said in a post on X.The treaty has come under strain in recent years due to increasing water demands, prolonged droughts, and climate change. While US officials argue that Mexico has repeatedly delayed its water transfers until the last minute, falling short in the latest cycle, Mexico itself is struggling with severe drought conditions.The issue is particularly sensitive for farmers in southern Texas, who rely on Mexican water deliveries for crops such as cotton and citrus. A year ago, the region’s last sugar mill was forced to shut down, with operators blaming a lack of water from Mexico.To ease the crisis, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement in November, days after Donald Trump’s election victory, to improve water deliveries. The deal, hailed by then-President Joe Biden’s administration, committed Mexico to more timely transfers, rather than waiting until the end of each five-year cycle.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, speaking before the state department’s announcement, said the matter was being handled through the countries’ boundary and water commission.""There's been less water. That's part of the problem,"" she told reporters.The dispute has also triggered political tensions, with Texas lawmakers pushing for stronger action.""Texas farmers are in crisis because of Mexico's noncompliance,"" Senator Ted Cruz wrote on X, welcoming the State Department’s stance.""I will work with the Trump administration to pressure Mexico into complying and to get water to Texas farmers.""In response to the crisis, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins announced a $280 million relief package for Rio Grande Valley farmers.The water dispute is unfolding as Trump takes a tough stance on Latin America, particularly on migration. He has vowed to crack down on undocumented arrivals, deployed troops to the border, and imposed tariffs on Mexico, though those have been temporarily paused until 2 April.","The US refused a request from Mexico for additional water deliveries, citing ongoing shortfalls in Mexico’s water-sharing commitments.

His tenure had been marked by tensions with the prime minister, particularly over proposed judicial reforms that divided the country. Their relationship further deteriorated following the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which led to the war in Gaza.An internal Shin Bet report, released on March 4, acknowledged failures in preventing the attack but also pointed to a government-backed policy of maintaining “quiet” with Hamas, which allowed the group to build up its military strength. Bar had previously indicated that he would resign before completing his term, accepting responsibility for the agency’s shortcomings.Earlier, attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara had challenged Netanyahu’s move to remove Bar, questioning the basis for the dismissal. She argued that the Shin Bet chief’s role was not dependent on the prime minister’s personal trust, calling attempts to frame it as such a “linguistic manipulation.”Netanyahu dismissed her concerns, asserting in a letter posted on X that the decision to fire Bar was within the government’s “exclusive authority” under Israeli law. He accused Baharav-Miara of overstepping her role and attempting to interfere in security matters during wartime.Bar responded to his dismissal by reaffirming his loyalty to the Israeli people, stating that Netanyahu’s “expectation of a duty of personal loyalty is fundamentally misguided.”This is the latest in a series of dismissals and forced departures of senior officials since the Hamas attack. Critics argue that Netanyahu is using these firings to consolidate power and shift blame, while his supporters maintain that he is taking necessary steps to restore security and stability.","Ronen Bar was appointed in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to call snap election on April 28: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-prime-minister-mark-carney-to-call-snap-election-on-april-28-reports/articleshow/119260891.cms,"File photo: Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney (Picture credit: AP)

The Globe and Mail

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to call a snap election, according to reports by local media, with the vote likely to take place on April 28. The announcement is expected this Sunday, and it marks the beginning of an election campaign that is set to focus heavily on the escalating trade war with the United States and the contentious rhetoric of US President Donald Trump, who has suggested that Canada could become the 51st state.As perthe major political parties—the Liberals, Conservatives, and New Democrats—have already made preparations, with campaign planes and buses in place and their war rooms primed for action.The Liberal Party has reportedly attracted several high-profile candidates, including former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson and former CTV host Evan Solomon. Former Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitão is also expected to run for the Liberals, the report said.Carney, a former Bank of England governor, was sworn in as Prime Minister last week after Justin Trudeau's resignation. The 60-year-old, who has no prior political experience but is widely regarded for his leadership during the 2008 financial crisis, has made it clear that his focus will be on protecting Canadian workers and families, particularly in the face of Trump’s trade actions.Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods has led to growing nationalistic sentiments in Canada, with many Canadians voicing frustration over the economic impact and US sovereignty threats. Public opinion polls suggest that many Canadians reject Trump's rhetoric, especially his repeated remarks about annexation.In response to these pressures, Carney has sought to strengthen Canada's global alliances, making his first trip abroad as Prime Minister to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. The trip was viewed as a signal of Carney’s intention to reduce Canada’s reliance on the U.S. and diversify its trade and security ties, particularly with European allies.","The Liberal Party has reportedly attracted several high-profile candidates, including former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson and former CTV host Evan Solomon.

US immigration authorities have detained an Indian post-doctoral researcher studying and teaching at Washington DC's Georgetown University and flagged him for deportation for his pro-Hamas activism they say violated terms of his exchange visitor visa.Badar Khan Suri , a post-graduate from Delhi's Jamia Millia, whose wife Maphaz Saleh is Palestinian, was taken from his home in Rosslyn just outside Washington DC on Monday and transferred to Louisiana pending deportation proceedings, according to the college newspaperMaphaz's father Ahmed Yousef is said to be a senior political advisor to Hamas, which the US has designated as a terrorist organisation.The couple met in Gaza when Suri was part of a humanitarian convoy in 2011. They married in 2014, after which Maphaz moved to Delhi and enrolled at Jamia Millia eventually earning a master’s degree in conflict analysis and peace-building from the Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace & Conflict Resolution.They came to the US sometime after 2020 following Suri's PhD; while he enrolled as a Peace & Conflict Studies Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgetown University's Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU), Maphaz is also pursuing a master’s degree at the School of Foreign Service’s (SFS) Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. Suri is currently teaching a class on majoritarianism and minority rights in South Asia and researching peace-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.Homeland Security officials said Suri was arrested under a US law that allows deportation of noncitizens whom “the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” He was accused of “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” with ""close connections"" to a senior advisor to Hamas.Georgetown University said it was not aware of Suri engaging in any illegal activity and had not received a reason for his detention. “We support our community members’ rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly,” a university spokesperson said.Suri's lawyer Hassan Ahmad suggested that his client had been abducted, saying he had no criminal record and nor has be been charged with any crime. ""Seeing our government abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible. And if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar."" the attorney Hassan Ahmad, said in a statement.A brief scrutiny of Suri's social media posts, which were infrequent, showed trenchant criticism of Israel's attacks on Gaza, including India's support for Israel. In a June 6, 2024 post, Suri mocked the Modi government for its purported support for Israel and abandonment of Palestine after a Palestinian network posted a video of a missile fragment with an India imprint on it.""From being an ally of Palestinians, to enabler if a genocide. What a disgrace for Made in India, to supply missiles to Israel so that Palestinian children can be butchered. Change of values for blood money. Shame,"" he wrote.While Suri was identified by Georgetown University as an Indian national,said ""Maphaz was a US citizen, raising questions in the MAGA sphere as to how the daughter of a Hamas representative came to acquire American citizenship.""","Badar Khan Suri, a post-graduate from Delhi's Jamia Millia, whose wife Maphaz Saleh is Palestinian, was taken from his home in Rosslyn just outside Washington DC on Monday and transferred to Louisiana pending deportation proceedings.

Legal battle over Riibe’s detention

Sudiksha Konanki missing case

An Iowa man who was previously named a person of interest in the disappearance of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic .Joshua Riibe , 22, was able to leave after securing a new passport from the US Consulate on the Caribbean island. He was accompanied by his father on the journey home, as per his lawyers, quoted by the New York Post.“The prosecutor’s office of La Altagracia informed [Riibe] of their readiness to return his passport,” said the Dominican law firm Guzman Ariza in an email to The Post. “While Joshua appreciated this decision, he chose, for privacy reasons, to apply for a new passport at the US Consulate, which was promptly issued. We are pleased to announce that Joshua and his father are currently traveling back to their home in the United States.”Riibe, a student at St Cloud State College, had been detained in the Dominican Republic since March 6, when Sudiksha Konanki vanished after the two went for an early morning swim in rough waters at the RIU Hotel & Resort in Punta Cana.Riibe told authorities that he had managed to pull Konanki to safety but lost consciousness on the beach, after which she was never seen again.Though officials identified Riibe as a person of interest, he was never formally named as a suspect in the case. However, his passport and phone were confiscated, preventing him from leaving the island.During a court hearing on Tuesday, tensions escalated as prosecutors pushed back against claims that Riibe was being unlawfully detained.Judge Edwin Delgado ruled in Riibe’s favour, granting his request to end police surveillance and allowing him to leave the resort, but he was still unable to leave the country.Finally on Wednesday, Riibe boarded a flight home to Rock Rapids, Iowa, bringing an end to his legal ordeal.Sudiksha Konanki, a 20 year old Indian-origin pre-med student from Chantilly, Virginia, went missing while on spring break with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana on March 6.Konanki's father initially suspected foul play and egged on the administration to widen their search when the mysterious disappearance of the Pitt University student was seen as a case of drowning.Konanki and a group of friends were at the beach before most of them decided to return to their hotel, leaving her behind with a male companion, according to Dominican media reports.After a massive search on land, water, and air turned yield no results even after 12 days, Sudiksha’s parents, Subbarayudu and Sridevi, finally gave up hope of their daughter returning alive. They wrote a letter to the Dominican Republic authorities, asking them to declare their daughter 'dead'.","Joshua Riibe, 22, has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic.

Tulsi Gabbard: French embassy reacts to claim of supporting Bangladesh over Tulsi Gabbard's statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/intellectually-weak-french-embassy-reacts-to-claim-of-supporting-bangladesh-over-tulsi-gabbards-statement/articleshow/119190471.cms,"The French Embassy in Dhaka criticized a social media post supporting Bangladesh's interim government stance against US intelligence chief Gabbard's comments on minority persecution. Bangladesh refuted Gabbard's claims as misleading, while Gabbard reiterated US concerns over minority persecution and Islamist terrorism.

What Bangladesh said on Gabbard's criticism



'US deeply concerned about persecution of minorities in Bangladesh': Tulsi



France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.Reacting to a post, France embassy said, ""How ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement @kawsarc @mainul_haque @carmel_trish.""A former Navy official Manoj Rawat, sharing the screenshot of French embassy sharing the Yunus' statement on Gabbad's post in his post on X, claimed that they are supporting the Yunus Government 's criticism of Gabbard's statement on the genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.He further said that it seems that the the Indo-French Strategic partnership is just a business arrangement for France to secure lucrative Defence contracts from India.""Time to call out the French mischief in the sub-continent,"" he said in a post on X.Bangladesh released a statement challenging Gabbard's observations, calling them ""misleading and damaging"" to the nation's standing.""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement.""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts. Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate,"" the statement added.Bangladesh also urged Gabbard to base her statements on ""actual knowledge"" when discussing sensitive issues, warning that such remarks could reinforce harmful stereotypes.""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears, and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions,"" the statement said.In media interviews later, Gabbard said the US was deeply concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump administration was committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally. She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration. In her meeting with Singh, Gabbard reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent Modi-Trump meeting in DC, while laying emphasis on intelligence-sharing.","France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.

US President Donald Trump said he has a “very good relationship” with India, but the “only problem” he has with the country is that it is “one of the highest tariffing nations in the world.” Trump reiterated his threat to impose reciprocal US tariffs starting April 2. In an interview with Breitbart News, an American news, opinion, and commentary website, Trump discussed the US’ relationship with India.On his summit with PM Narendra Modi last month, Trump said: “I have a very good relationship with India... I believe they’re going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us”. On India-Middle East-Europe-Economic Corridor (IMEC), Trump said it was a “group of wonderful nations” banding together “countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade”. “We have a powerful group of partners in trade,” Trump said. “Again, we can’t let those partners treat us badly, however, we do better in many ways frankly with our foes than we do with our friends.”“The ones that wouldn’t be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly, like the European Union, which treats us terribly on trade. India and everybody would think of them as an ally,” the US president said, adding, “I can say the same for others. But this is a group of wonderful nations that is countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade.” In the past, Trump has called India “tariff king” & a “big abuser”. Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal told a parliamentary panel on March 10 that negotiations are still on and no agreement on trade tariffs has been reached so far between India and the US. India had said it was looking at deepening trade ties with the US, including by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, under a bilateral trade agreement.","US President Donald Trump said he has a “very good relationship’ with India.

Violence against Tesla called 'domestic terrorism'



'Brand tornado crisis moment' for Tesla



Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) celebrates her birthday on March 29 and this time she has a birthday wishlist ready in place as she announced on a live stream set up by #TeslaTakedown. She said she wanted Elon to be taken down as her birthday protest leading to massive outrage that she urged for violence against Elon Musk. TeslaTakedown has organized several protests outside Tesla showrooms in the past few weeks -- as a statement against Elon Musk , his growing influence in the government, his decisions to shut government departments sending hundreds of people out of jobs.The group is planning its biggest day of action on Match 29 with planned protests at 277 Tesla locations in the US and 500 abroad.“I am truly here for very selfish reasons, starting with on March 29 it’s my birthday and all I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down,"" Crockett said.“Obviously, everything that I am promoting is non-violent,” she added.Crockett's call for 'taking down' Elon Musk came as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that three people accused of destroying Tesla cars and charging stations are facing 20 years in reason for 'domestic terrorism'. “The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,” Bondi said in a statement.“Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” she added.President Donald Trump denounced that attack on Tesla and vowed to take action against them, as he bought a Tesla car to show his support for Tesla.Tesla Thursday announced a recall of 46,000 Cybertrucks in the US to fix an exterior panel that could detach while driving. Vancouver International Auto Show removed Tesla from its event citing security concerns.

""Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed and forced me into an unmarked car. At that moment, my only concern was for Noor’s safety. I had no idea if she would be taken too, since the agents had threatened to arrest her for not leaving my side.

""Columbia surrendered to federal pressure by disclosing student records to Congress and yielding to the Trump administration's latest threats,"" he said.""The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent.

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries. The FIA now faces criticism for its handling of the operation and its failure to prevent the looting during what was meant to be a major crackdown on international cybercrime.","Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday. It was unclear who was behind the attack, and an investigation was being conducted.","Pakistani security forces raid two hideouts used by an armed group, triggering gun battles.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Earthquake of magnitude 4.9 jolts Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/earthquake-of-magnitude-4-9-jolts-afghanistan/articleshow/119274487.cms,"Earthquake of magnitude 4.9 jolts Afghanistan

Kabul : A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.In a post on X, NCS stated, ""EQ of M: 4.9, On: 21/03/2025 01:00:57 IST, Lat: 36.48 N, Long: 71.45 E, Depth: 160 Km, Location: Afghanistan.Earlier on March 13, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Afghanistan.As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.""EQ of M: 4.0, On: 13/03/2025 13:58:36 IST, Lat: 36.69 N, Long: 69.70 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Afghanistan,"" NCS noted.Shallow earthquakes like this one are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.As per the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks, UNOCHA noted.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes, and the Hindu Kush Mountain range is a geologically active area where quakes occur every year, according to the Red Cross.Afghanistan sits on numerous fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, with a fault line also running directly through Herat.When earthquakes strike, their magnitude is important but also their depth, with shallow earthquakes wrecking more damage than those deeper into the Earth. Afghanistan is unfortunately prone to these shallow earthquakes, due to the region's tectonic plates often slipping past one another, as opposed to colliding directly.","A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS) The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.
