Modi-Bibi ties have led to govt silence on 'genocide': Sonia Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-bibi-ties-have-led-to-govt-silence-on-genocide-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/124133419.cms,"NEW DELHI: Dubbing India's ""silence"" on the issue of Palestine as abdication of humanity and morality, Congress' Sonia Gandhi said Modi govt's actions in the wake of Israel's ""genocide"" are dictated by ""personal friendship"" between Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and PM Modi, and not by India's constitutional values or strategic interests.In a media article, Sonia said, ""This style of personalised diplomacy is never tenable and cannot be the guiding compass of India's foreign policy.

"48 detained, calm prevails in curfew-bound Leh after violence over Sixth Schedule",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/48-detained-calm-prevails-in-curfew-bound-leh-after-violence-over-sixth-schedule/articleshow/124130171.cms,"Centre should pay attention to legitimate demands, says CM Omar Abdullah

(inputs from Sanjay Khajuria in Jammu)

SRINAGAR: Police detained 48 people during pre-dawn searches Thursday after four protesters were killed and more than 80 wounded when security forces allegedly opened fire to quash a violent demonstration in Leh demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.Peace returned Thursday under heavy curfew. Traffic on streets in Leh was thin, with only official vehicles moving. Alongside police and paramilitary, ITBP patrolled to enforce order. District magistrate Romil Singh Donk ordered closure of all schools and colleges for two days from Sept 26.At Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, calm prevailed after Wednesday’s rush. Sources said four bodies were handed to families following autopsy, while recovered bullets were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory in J&K. About 60 of the wounded were discharged. One critical patient will be shifted to AIIMS, officials said.The clashes left 20 security personnel among the wounded. Protesters torched the BJP office, damaged public property, and threw stones at forces. LG Kavinder Gupta accused demonstrators of trying to set a paramilitary vehicle on fire and blamed “outsiders” and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk’s “provocative” statements for inflaming youth.Wangchuk held a hunger strike from Sept 9 for Sixth Schedule and statehood, which he ended Wednesday.Sixth Schedule in the Constitution grants tribal areas in the Northeast autonomy over land, resources and culture. Ladakhis have sought similar protections since 2019 when J&K was carved into two Union territories, including Ladakh. Talks with a high-powered committee set up by Centre in 2023 yielded only a domicile policy. Another round is due Oct 6, but delays have fuelled anger.Ladakh MP Haji Mohammad Haneefa Jan demanded an investigation into the use of bullets and pellets, calling the force “disproportionate”. Speaking in Kargil, where a shutdown was observed on the call of Kargil Democratic Alliance, he said govt delays in dialogue had frustrated youth. Kargil district magistrate imposed curfew Thursday morning.J&K CM Omar Abdullah urged restraint. “They should adopt the path of peace, and govt should pay attention to their legitimate demands,” he said, adding that authorities must examine “why such situations arise instead of blaming others”.In Srinagar, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah rejected LG’s claims of outside involvement. “China is on our doorstep and has already taken control of much of our land. It is better to resolve the issue through dialogue,” he said.Congress veteran Karan Singh, son of J&K’s last Dogra ruler, appealed to Ladakhis to remain calm and urged govt to consider constitutional safeguards. “Inclusion in something like the Sixth Schedule seems an eminently reasonable solution,” he said.Congress functionaries from J&K and Ladakh blamed BJP and Centre for ignoring demands over land, culture, jobs and political rights. “Now indulging in blame game is part of their diversionary tactics… it is an insult to the peaceful people of Ladakh,” they said in a joint statement.",Police detained 48 people during pre-dawn searches Thursday after four protesters were killed and more than 80 wounded.

Congress raises Mandal pitch as Kharge slams caste rally ban in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-raises-mandal-pitch-as-kharge-slams-caste-rally-ban-in-up/articleshow/124133354.cms,"Mallikarjun Kharge (File photo)

NEW DELHI: After aggressive advocacy of caste census, removal of 50% ceiling on reservations and private sector quota, Congress has asserted its new branding as a ""social justice"" platform by slamming UP govt's ban on caste-based political rallies.In a little-noticed statement, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, at a CWC meet in Patna, asked PM Modi to answer how does the all-round acceptance of caste census square up with threat to jail people who come out to protest against atrocities inflicted on them. By linking the ban to UP CM Yogi Adityanath ""who has written in the past against reservations"", Kharge sought to paint caste rallies as part of protest and mobilisation rooted in caste injustices - in support for the now-banned gatherings.The reaction from the AICC chief has been stronger than the words of protest murmured by some regional parties of Mandal hue.But insiders said it is in line with the new politics, being pursued by Congress with a special nudge from Rahul Gandhi, who has found a strong ally in the party president. Since his debut, Rahul followed aggressive ""pro-poor politics"" with an element of Dalits and weaker sections. However, things took a dramatic turn over two years ago when he shifted gears to whole-heartedly embrace Mandalite fervour, with features like caste census and reservations.",Mallikarjun Kharge slams UP govt's ban on caste-based political rallies.

Travis Decker dead? US Marshals declare army veteran who 'killed' 3 daughters deceased; DNA test awaited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/travis-decker-dead-us-marshals-service-declares-suspected-child-killer-deceased-sheriff-awaits-dna-confirmation/articleshow/124102287.cms,"



The US Marshals Service has declared Travis Decker, the 32-year-old Army veteran accused of murdering his three daughters, deceased. But Chelan County authorities said on Wednesday that confirmation of his death is still pending DNA results.In a filing this week, federal prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the case and quash Decker’s arrest warrant. “The United States Marshals Service has advised the Defendant TRAVIS CALEB DECKER is deceased,” the document said. US Attorney S Peter Serrano confirmed the motion followed the Marshals Service’s advice.Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison pushed back on the timing of the declaration, calling it premature. “We are currently awaiting DNA test results from the state Crime Lab, which are expected to be returned within the next few days,” his office said. “Once the DNA results are confirmed, the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office will hold a press conference to share findings and address any questions from the media and public. ”Skeletal remains believed to be Decker’s were found last week on Grindstone Mountain at an elevation of 4,000 feet.They were discovered with personal items including clothing, a bracelet, and chewing tobacco. Coroner Wayne Harris said his office must rely on scientific confirmation. “Other agencies can speak about their investigation into Mr. Decker and locating human remains, and can state that based on circumstantial evidence that the remains located are his,” Harris said. “The Chelan County Coroner’s Office does not have that luxury. We must rely on scientific methods to establish positive identification.”Decker had been on the run since June, when the bodies of his daughters — 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn and 5-year-old Olivia — were discovered at a campground near Leavenworth. Investigators said the girls had been bound with zip ties, suffocated with plastic bags, and their deaths ruled as homicides.The discovery of remains came after a drone search spotted a shirt consistent with what Decker was last seen wearing. Morrison said all signs indicate Decker died in that location some time ago.Arianna Cozart, attorney for Decker’s ex-wife Whitney, said in a statement last week: “We are praying that the remains found are confirmed to be Travis’s. We continue to be grateful for law enforcement’s efforts in this case and are forever appreciative of the entire world’s love, compassion, and support for Whitney.”Decker, a former infantryman who served in Afghanistan, was known to have survival skills and lived out of his truck at times. The manhunt for him became the largest in Chelan County’s history.The US Marshals Service had previously offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.","US Marshals Service has declared Travis Decker, the 32-year-old Army veteran accused of murdering his three daughters, deceased.

Age: 26

Native of Kulgam district, South Kashmir

Identified as an Over Ground Worker (OGW) for The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT)

Provided logistical support to terrorists involved in the Pahalgham attack

Helped the attackers navigate Kulgam’s forested terrain

Pahalgam massacre





SRINAGAR: Srinagar police on Wednesday arrested Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, from South Kashmir’s Kulgam district, in connection with the April 22 Pahalgham terror attack that left 26 people, mostly tourists, dead. Katari is alleged to have provided crucial logistical support to the terrorists involved, who were later neutralized during Operation Mahadev.Authorities say Katari’s arrest follows intense questioning and intelligence leads that exposed his role in assisting Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s proxy group, The Resistance Front.As per news agency PTI, Katari’s assistance included guiding terrorists through local terrain, enabling them to plan and execute their operations.Security agencies are now interrogating Katari to determine the extent of his involvement and whether other associates remain active in the region.Katari's arrest followed an extensive investigation after Operation Mahadev, during which security forces killed the three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack.“The investigation trail led us to Kataria. He was taken into custody following forensic examination of weapons seized from him,” a police officer said.Forensic analysis of weapons recovered from the encounter site at Dachigam, including two AK-47s and one M4 carbine rifle helped link Katari to the plot. The seized weapons were sent to a forensic lab in Chandigarh, confirming their use in the attack.The April 22 assault in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot in Pahalgam often called ""mini Switzerland"", marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since Pulwama in 2019.The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the massacre.India’s response to the Pahalgam attack came in the form of Operation Sindoor, a coordinated tri-services military operation targeting nine terror camps across Pakistan.Backed by multi-agency intelligence and government support, the operation involved precision airstrikes, robust air defence, and maritime dominance. Key Pakistani airbases were hit, and retaliatory drone attacks were effectively neutralised through integrated command systems.The Army, Navy, Air Force, and BSF worked in full synergy to eliminate threats and secure Indian territory. Operation SINDOOR marked a decisive, calibrated response to cross-borderThe three were senior Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives killed in an encounter in Dachigam forest near Srinagar on July 28 during Operation Mahadev.They had been hiding there since the April 22 attack in Pahalgam’s Baisaran meadow, which claimed 26 lives.The arrest of Katari is seen as a breakthrough in uncovering the broader support network behind the attack.","Police in Jammu and Kashmir arrest Mohammad Katari, 26, for allegedly aiding terrorists in the deadly Pahalgam attack on April 22.

BAREILLY: Senior leader of Samajwadi Party (SP), Azam Khan , who finally walked out of Sitapur jail two days ago after almost 23 months, on Thursday reiterated his allegiance to his party, saying that ""(SP chief) Akhilesh (Yadav) is to me what he was to Mulayam ji. "" Back in his Rampur home, he added: ""I have a character, and I have shown that it is not for sale.""Notably, speculations are rife of the former UP cabinet minister's switch to BSP . However, dismissing the rumours, he said, ""I may be a fool, but not that dumb. There is no doubt, I'll remain with the party.""Rumours of the SP veteran joining his long-time rival Mayawati's party gained momentum following purported reports of his wife, former MP Tazeen Fatima, meeting the BSP leader in Delhi, and that Khan might participate in the party's ‘mega' rally scheduled in Lucknow on Oct 9.The BSP, however, has remained evasive on the matter so far, with the party's lone sitting MLA, Uma Shankar Singh, claiming ignorance about any such meeting. He did add, however, that Khan's entry into the party would strengthen it. Experts believe if Khan were to join the BSP, the move might help the party reclaim influence among certain sections of Muslim voters, particularly in parts of Western UP. Meanwhile, president of the Aazad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) Chandrashekar Azad said that he will meet Khan soon.Khan's legal troubles began in Feb 2020, when he, his wife Tazeen Fatima, and son Abdullah Azam surrendered in Rampur over a forged birth certificate case. Over the following years, he faced multiple charges, including forgery, land grabbing and theft. In Oct 2022, he was convicted of hate speech and sentenced to three years in prison, disqualifying him from the UP assembly. After spending months in jail, he secured interim bail from the Supreme Court in May 2022.His second imprisonment began in Oct 2023, when a court in Rampur sentenced him, his wife and son to seven years in the forged certificate case. While his family managed to secure release in 2025, Khan remained in prison, facing fresh convictions and acquittals, including a 10-year sentence in a 2016 house eviction case, bail in theft charges and acquittal in a 2008 protest case. He was sentenced in six cases and has now been granted bail in all of them, though several other cases remain under trial.","Azam Khan walked out of Sitapur jail two days ago after almost 23 months.

British woman’s murder: Lutyen's Delhi crime scene was once Congress HQ; ‘White House’ holds history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/british-womans-murder-crime-scene-was-once-part-of-history/articleshow/124129851.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The murder of 85-year-old British national Pauline Crowther Ann has put the spotlight on a property which once was witness to making history but has now been consigned to a mundane existence. The crime scene, called ‘The White House', is part of 7, Jantar Mantar Road, which once served as the headquarters of Congress.Initially headquartered at Anand Bhawan, Allahabad, during the freedom struggle, Congress relocated to 7, Jantar Mantar Road after Independence. According to several accounts, former PM Jawaharlal Nehru spent considerable time at this address, which also saw visits by Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel. It was here that Nehru appointed Indira Gandhi as the Congress president in 1959.Following the split in Congress in 1969, two factions emerged — Congress (R) and Congress (O). A few party old-timers recalled that the split led to the Morarji Desai-led faction to 7, Jantar Mantar Road while the Indira-led faction moved to temporary offices at Windsor Place and then to 5, Rajendra Prasad Road, before arriving at 24, Akbar Road in 1978. Congress (O) merged with Janata Party in 1977 and later became Janata Dal, and finally JD(U).Once a vibrant political hub, the campus today bears a deserted look, with a couple of dosa vends in the vicinity buzzing with more activity. Entering the campus through a rusted iron gate, one first passes an office currently rented by JD(U) before reaching ‘The White House'.The premises houses 30-40 units with dilapidated outer facades, many of which have been sublet. A few residents, not wishing to be named, said their ancestors were members of Congress and had been allotted the property to live in.A library, managed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Smarak Trust, functions out of the ground floor of the JD(U) office. Apart from a small canteen and a few offices, the area is largely quiet — and most of its current occupants seem unaware that a murder has taken place there.Even decades later, there isn't much clarity on who owns the sprawling campus. During investigation of the British woman's murder, police personnel, trying to zero down on a suspect, veered into the neighbourhood to verify the antecedents of local residents, and to ascertain whether they were tenants or owners. However, their efforts appeared to have reached a dead end.In 2016, an RTI query by an activist had led to questions about the property's ownership. ""As per the records of lease-1 Section of Land & Development Office, there is no information as to which political parties the property at 7, Jantar Mantar Road, New Delhi was allotted,"" read the RTI reply. However, the file notings in the reply quoted the department of legal affairs saying that legal ownership rested with central govt.Surender Kumar, trustee of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Smarak Trust, claimed that the property belongs to the trust. ""Between 1945 and 1977, the then-president of the Bombay Provincial Congress Committee, S K Patil, had said the building would serve as the Congress headquarters. However, if anything were to change, ownership would revert to the trust,"" he said.","The crime scene, called ‘The White House', is part of 7, Jantar Mantar Road, which once served as the headquarters of Congress.

NEW DELHI: Swami Chaitanyananda Saraswati, also known as Parthasarathy, who is accused of sexually harassing 17 female students at a management college in Delhi's Vasant Kunj, allegedly turned the women’s hostel into a fear chamber.Sources said he maintained his own accommodation inside the hostel, which can house 75 students, and had remote access to CCTV footage on his phone, giving him constant surveillance over the girls.Investigations revealed that he tampered with the institute’s DVR system, destroying key CCTV evidence.Police confirmed that cameras were installed in lobby and washroom areas under the guise of security, enabling him to intimidate students.The FIR stated that he routinely threatened students with suspension and rustication, leaving parents powerless to intervene.Former students alleged that Chaitanyananda forced one girl to change her name against her will and made others wait for hours in his cabin with promises of marks, placements, and tours.Complaints to the University Outreach Program, Directorate of Education, and Air Headquarters were later forwarded to the college management in early August.The inquiry also uncovered alleged financial misconduct. Chaitanyananda reportedly sublet institute property to private companies and used the funds to buy luxury vehicles, including a BMW, which police later seized.Victims recounted instances where he forcibly took female students out in his cars, adding to the climate of fear he cultivated in the hostel.","Swami Chaitanyananda Saraswati, also known as Parthasarathy, is accused of sexually harassing 17 female students at a management college in Delhi's Vasant Kunj.

In a touching moment of history and humanity, King Charles III visited the world’s oldest living person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, at Hallmark Lakeview Care Home in Lightwater, Surrey. The meeting took place shortly after the King completed his official duties, including bidding farewell to US President Donald Trump at the end of his state visit and attending several high-level diplomatic events.Unlike formal royal ceremonies, this encounter was deeply personal and heartfelt. For the King, it was an opportunity to pay respect to a remarkable woman whose lifetime spans more than a century of world events and societal transformations, and for Mrs. Caterham, it was the fulfillment of a cherished wish she had expressed—to meet the monarch in person after celebrating her extraordinary milestone birthday.Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, making her a witness to over 11 decades of world history. Her long life has seen humanity transition through wars, revolutions, pandemics, and technological transformations that reshaped the modern world, including the rise of aviation, space exploration, global communications, and major cultural shifts across continents.In April 2025, she officially became the world’s oldest living person following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canbarro Lucas, who was also 116 at the time of her passing. Beyond her age, what makes Mrs. Caterham’s life even more extraordinary is that she remains the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, connecting her directly to the Edwardian era and Britain’s early 20th-century monarchy, bridging history in a truly remarkable way.Throughout her 116 years, Ethel Caterham has lived through defining moments in global history. As a young child, she grew up in the aftermath of the Edwardian period, only to witness the First World War during her formative years. By the time she was 20, the world was in the grip of the Great Depression, and within a decade, she would see the devastation of the Second World War unfold.She also lived through monumental shifts such as the Russian Revolution, the decline of colonial empires, the rise of modern technology, and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Few people alive today can claim to have seen the world transform in so many profound ways.As BBC reported, when King Charles III greeted Mrs. Caterham, the interaction was filled with warmth and wit. She reminisced about his 1969 investiture as the Prince of Wales, telling him: “I remember when your mother crowned you in Caernarfon Castle.”She went on to add with a smile that during his youth, “all the girls were in love with you and wanted to marry you.” The King responded with laughter and a humorous grimace, joking: “Yes well, all that’s left of him anyway.”This exchange highlighted not only Mrs. Caterham’s sharp memory but also her sense of humor, which continues to shine even after 116 years of life.Ethel Caterham’s personal life is as rich as her historical experiences. She was the second youngest of eight siblings and grew up in Tidworth, Wiltshire. At 18, she moved to India to work as an au pair for a military family, an adventure that shaped her independence at a time when international travel for women was rare.She returned to the UK at 21, where she met her future husband Norman at a dinner party in 1931. Together, they raised two daughters, building a family legacy that now includes three granddaughters and five great-grandchildren.Remarkably, she lived an active life well into her later years, even driving until the age of 97. For the past 50 years, she has made Surrey her permanent home, remaining close to her family.When Mrs. Caterham turned 115 in 2024, she received a personal congratulatory letter from King Charles, praising her for reaching a “truly remarkable milestone.” While her birthday celebration was kept quiet, she expressed that she would have gladly traded the occasion for a meeting with the King.This year, her wish came true. The King’s personal visit underscored the royal family’s long-standing tradition of honoring the nation’s oldest citizens. In the UK, it is customary for monarchs to send birthday greetings to those turning 100 or older, but in Mrs. Caterham’s case, the tribute went even further—a royal encounter in person.Supercentenarians, people who live beyond the age of 110, are extremely rare. There are fewer than 100 verified individuals alive worldwide who have reached this milestone, making Mrs. Caterham’s achievement extraordinary on a global scale. Longevity researchers study individuals like her to understand the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that contribute to such remarkable lifespans.In Ethel Caterham’s case, her resilience, sense of humor, and family support appear to be key contributors to her well-being. Her ability to drive until nearly 100 and remain mentally sharp well past her centenary suggests an active lifestyle played a role in her long life.","Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire.

Police confirmed the closure had been triggered by suspected drone activity.The incident followed several disruptions this week, with unidentified drones sighted over airports in Aalborg, Billund, Esbjerg, and Sonderborg, as well as at the Skrydstrup air base. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Denmark had become the target of “hybrid attacks” aimed at spreading fear and division, adding: “There is one main country that poses a threat to Europe’s security, and it is Russia.”Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said the purpose of the flights was “to spread fear, create division and frighten us”, while Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen suggested the pattern of activity showed “the work of a professional actor” though it posed “no direct military threat”. Russia has firmly denied involvement, calling the incidents “a staged provocation”.",Airspace over Aalborg in northern Denmark was shut late on Thursday after drones were reportedly seen in the area.

SEOUL: South Korea's military said it fired warning shots early Friday to drive away a North Korean merchant ship that briefly crossed the disputed western sea boundary between the rival neighbours.The ship crossed the Northern Limit Line near the South Korean border island of Baengnyeong around 5 am but retreated after South Korea's military issued an audio warning and fired warning shots, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.There were no immediate reports that North Korean forces returned fire or responded with force.The response was carried out in accordance with operational procedures and the military remains in a heightened state of readiness to firmly safeguard territorial waters, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.South Korea's military frequently has fired warning shots to repel North Korean patrol or commercial vessels breaching its waters. The poorly marked western sea boundary between the Koreas has been the scene of past skirmishes and attacks, including the North's 2010 shelling of a South Korean island and its alleged torpedoing of a South Korean navy ship, which together killed 50 South Koreans.During a fiery speech in January 2024, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country does not recognise the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea, which was drawn by the US-led UN Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea insists on a boundary encroaching deeply into South Korea-controlled waters.The Koreas exchanged warning shots in 2022 after the South's navy fired at a North Korean merchant ship that crossed the western sea boundary.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea continues to dismiss Seoul's calls to resume diplomacy.

‘General Squid Games’: Pete Hegseth summons military top brass — triggers anxiety in DC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/general-squid-games-pete-hegseth-summons-military-top-brass-triggers-anxiety-in-dc/articleshow/124143325.cms,"Pete Hegseth (AP)





US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of America’s top military commanders to a sudden meeting at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, next Tuesday, sparking unease inside the Pentagon and across the armed forces.According to officials who spoke to CNN and the New York Times, the gathering will include generals and admirals of one-star rank or higher, along with their senior advisers, flown in from across the United States and overseas. No explanation has been offered for the mass directive, which some insiders are already referring to as “the general squid games.”The Pentagon confirmed the meeting but declined to provide details. Chief spokesman Sean Parnell said only that Hegseth would be “addressing his senior military leaders early next week.” The Washington Post first reported on the order, which has been filtering through commands and caused what the New York Times described as “anxiety and concern” in the ranks.CNN reported that officials remain in the dark about the purpose, with theories ranging from a sweeping review of the Defence Department to mass firings.One congressional aide told the network, “Unless Hegseth planned to announce a major new military campaign or a complete overhaul of the military command structure, I can’t imagine a good reason for this.” Other officials voiced unease about concentrating so many senior leaders in one location, raising security concerns.The backdrop to the meeting is a period of turmoil under the Trump administration. Hegseth has led a drive to cut the number of four-star officers by at least 20% and overseen the removal of several high-profile figures, including former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. CQ Brown, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, and Gen. James Slife. CNN noted that some firings were tied to Hegseth’s campaign against diversity initiatives, while others were left unexplained.President Donald Trump, asked about the gathering on Thursday, downplayed speculation. “Isn’t it nice that people are coming from all over the world to meet?” he said, adding that the event would partly focus on reviewing military equipment. “We have the greatest equipment in the world. A lot of generals want to be here. They’re also going to be touring equipment sites. They’re going to be talking about the newest weapons. ”","US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of America’s top military commanders to a sudden meeting at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, next Tuesday.

Two US inmates were executed Thursday in separate states, with one put to death by nitrogen gas in Alabama and another by lethal injection in Texas. The executions, carried out within 18 minutes of each other, bring the total number of US executions this year to 33, the highest since 2014.In Alabama, Geoffrey West, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m. US Central Time for the 1997 murder of Margaret Berry, 33, a mother of two, during a gas station robbery in Attalla. In his final statement, provided to USA TODAY by his attorneys, West apologized and reflected on faith, saying, ""I am at peace because I know where I am going and look forward to seeing Mrs. Berry when I get there... I urge everyone, especially young people, to find God. ""Berry's son, Will Berry, who was 11 when his mother was killed, had sought a reprieve, expressing a wish to meet West before his execution. ""I believe that in seeking to execute Mr. West, the state of Alabama is playing God,"" he wrote in an opinion piece. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declined to commute the sentence, citing the state's legal duty to punish egregious crimes. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, ""Margaret did not have to senselessly die... Justice is how we restore peace to the communities they leave behind.""Just 18 minutes later in Texas, Blaine Milam, 35, was executed by lethal injection for the 2008 killing of his girlfriend’s 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, during what Milam and the mother described as an ""exorcism."" Court documents described the child’s death as including 24 bite marks, 18 broken ribs, severe skull fractures, and genital injuries. Milam’s final words, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, thanked the department for allowing him to join a faith-based program on death row. ""I love you all, bring me home Jesus,"" he said.Milam’s attorneys argued that he is intellectually disabled and that the bite mark evidence in his case was unreliable. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected those claims. His case was featured in Werner Herzog’s 2013 documentary, ""On Death Row.""Both executions mark the fifth instance this year where two inmates were executed on the same day in the United States. Florida has carried out the most executions this year, followed by South Carolina and Texas.President Donald Trump, a proponent of capital punishment, signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday directing federal prosecutors to pursue the death penalty in Washington, D.C., for the nation’s most heinous crimes. The memo, cited by USA TODAY, highlights Trump’s commitment to enforcing federal capital punishment despite opposition from some politicians, lawyers, and non-governmental organizations.Nine more executions are scheduled in eight states by the end of 2025, putting the U.S. on pace to execute at least 42 inmates this year, a number not seen since 2012. The next execution is set for Sept. 30 in Florida, where Victor Tony Jones is scheduled to be lethally injected for the 1990 stabbing murders of inventor Jacob Nestor and his wife, Matilda Nestor.

An Arizona man was convicted Thursday on eight murder charges for a series of fatal shootings that targeted random victims as well as his own mother and stepfather over a three-week period in late 2017.Cleophus Cooksey Jr., 43, was also found guilty of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery. Authorities did not provide a motive, and Cooksey maintained his innocence throughout the months-long trial. The sentencing phase of the trial begins Monday, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty.The killings began on November 27, 2017, when Andrew Remillard, 27, and Parker Smith, 21, were found shot in the head inside a parked car in Phoenix. Five days later, Salim Richards, 31, a security guard, was killed while walking to his girlfriend’s apartment. His 9 mm Glock handgun and a necklace were stolen.On December 13, Latorrie Beckford, 29, was found shot twice in the head in the common area of a Glendale apartment complex. Two days later, Kristopher Cameron, 21, was shot while arriving at another Glendale complex to conduct a drug transaction with Cooksey.Later that day, Maria Villanueva, 43, was abducted from a parking lot by an unknown man captured on surveillance cameras. She was found partially nude and shot to death the following morning in a Phoenix alley. Investigators said Cooksey’s DNA was recovered from her body, and her car keys were found in his possession at the time of his arrest.The spree ended on December 17, when police responding to gunfire at Cooksey’s mother’s apartment found Rene Cooksey, 56, and her husband, Edward Nunn, 54, dead from gunshot wounds. Cooksey initially told officers he had cut his hand and was the only one home, but threatened an officer when they tried to detain him.Authorities also recovered Salim Richards’ gun, later linked to the killings of Beckford, Cameron, and Villanueva. Police said Cooksey was wearing Richards’ stolen necklace at the time of his arrest. Prosecutors declined to charge Cooksey in a suspected ninth killing of his ex-girlfriend’s brother, Jesus Real.Cooksey’s victims included people he knew and strangers. Adriana Rodriguez, the daughter of Villanueva, said her family finally received closure with the verdict. “He took my mom, the only support system that I had,” she said, breaking into tears.A family friend of Rene Cooksey and Edward Nunn, Eric Hampton, called Cooksey a “monster” and expressed hope that he would receive the death penalty. “I thought maybe he had a little heart. But he doesn't have any heart at all, you know, to actually do these things to people and actually the worst part, kill your own mom,” Hampton said outside the courthouse.The killings occurred four months after Cooksey’s release from prison on a manslaughter conviction linked to a 2001 strip club robbery in which an accomplice was killed. Cooksey, an aspiring musician, consistently claimed he was innocent. In a 2020 handwritten letter to a judge, he wrote that he was “not a rapist or murderer” and described himself as a “music artist.”The trial was delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cooksey appeared in court looking down as the verdicts were read.Cooksey’s arrest followed two previous serial shooting sprees in metro Phoenix. In 2015, a series of 11 shootings occurred on Phoenix freeways over several weeks, but no serious injuries were reported and charges against the accused were later dismissed.The next case, which lasted nearly a year and ended in July 2016, involved bus driver Aaron Juan Saucedo, who was charged with killing nine people. Saucedo’s trial is scheduled for December, and he has pleaded not guilty.Maricopa County prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Cooksey during the upcoming sentencing phase, citing the brutal nature of the killings and the inclusion of his own family members among the victims. Authorities have said the case represents one of the most disturbing serial murder sprees in recent Arizona history.","Cleophus Cooksey Jr., 43, was also found guilty of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery. Authorities did not provide a motive, and Cooksey maintained his innocence throughout the months-long trial. The sentencing phase of the trial begins Monday, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124140584,imgsize-1217231,width-400,resizemode-4/arizona-jury-convicts-man-in-string-of-shootings-that-killed-8-in-metro-phoenix-ap-photo.jpg"

'Hybrid attacks': What Denmark revealed about drone & disruption at airports; Russia denies involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/hybrid-attacks-what-denmark-revealed-about-drone-disruption-at-airports-russia-denies-involvement/articleshow/124139555.cms,"Drones Over Copenhagen Airport A 'Serious Attack'; Russia Breaks Silence, NATO Vows Response

Prime minister calls it ‘hybrid attacks’





Aim to create fear, says justice minister









Denmark said Thursday that drone flights over multiple airports this week were part of “hybrid attacks” aimed at spreading fear and disrupting the country, prompting authorities to consider new security measures and closer coordination with NATO allies. Russia firmly denied involvement, calling the incidents a “staged provocation.”Authorities confirmed that unidentified drones were seen over several Danish airports, including Aalborg, Esbjerg, Sonderborg and the Skrydstrup air base, as well as near Billund, the country’s second-largest airport. Aalborg was closed for several hours, while Billund was briefly shut following unverified reports of drone activity. Earlier in the week, a similar episode had forced Copenhagen Airport, Denmark’s busiest, to halt operations.North Jutland police inspector Jesper Bojgaard Madsen said drones over Aalborg flew “over a very large area over a couple of hours” and could not be intercepted. Police said investigations were under way in cooperation with the intelligence service and the armed forces.“Over recent days, Denmark has been the victim of hybrid attacks,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a video address on social media.She warned that such incursions “could multiply” and highlighted Russia as the main security threat to Europe.“There is one main country that poses a threat to Europe’s security, and it is Russia,” Frederiksen said. She added that she had discussed the incidents with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.The Kremlin rejected the accusations. “We firmly reject any suggestion of involvement in these incidents,” the Russian Embassy in Copenhagen said in a social media post, describing the drone flights as “a staged provocation.”Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said the purpose of the flights was “to spread fear, create division and frighten us.” He said Denmark would invest in new capabilities to “detect” and “neutralise” drones in response to the incidents.Defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the pattern of activity suggested “the work of a professional actor” with “systematic navigation across several locations at virtually the same time.” While he noted that the flights posed “no direct military threat,” Poulsen said they highlighted Denmark’s vulnerability to hybrid warfare and sabotage.Military intelligence officials said investigators had not yet identified those responsible. “The risk of Russian sabotage in Denmark is high,” said intelligence chief Finn Borch.Denmark has not yet decided whether to invoke NATO’s Article 4, which allows a member state to call consultations if its security or territorial integrity is threatened. Poulsen said the option remained under consideration given the “current security situation in Europe.”French President Emmanuel Macron voiced solidarity, saying France was ready “to contribute to the security of Danish airspace.” European defence ministers are due to meet Friday to discuss drones as emerging threats, while EU leaders are scheduled to gather in Copenhagen next week for a summit.The incidents in Denmark follow drone incursions in Norway, Polish and Romanian airspace, and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets. Earlier this month, more than 20 Russian drones crossed into Polish territory, prompting Warsaw to trigger NATO’s Article 4.European analysts describe such actions as part of so-called “grey zone” or hybrid warfare tactics designed to destabilise opponents without open conflict. “Russia sees a new opportunity space and is trying to explore it,” said Flemming Splidsboel Hansen, a researcher on hybrid warfare and post-Soviet Russia.For many Danes, the drone sightings stirred unease. “I feel rather insecure. I live in a country where there has been peace since 1945. I am not really used to thinking about war,” said 85-year-old Birgit Larsen in central Copenhagen.Others expressed a more measured view. “It’s probably Russia, you know, testing the borders of Europe. They fly close to the borders and stuff and try to provoke, but not threaten,” said 48-year-old Torsten Froling.The threat posed by drones to airports has grown in recent years. In December 2018, drone activity over Gatwick Airport in London disrupted hundreds of flights, while in January 2019, drone reports near Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey temporarily halted air traffic.Danish officials said the latest events underscore the need to strengthen defences. The government recently announced plans to acquire long-range precision weapons for the first time, citing Russia as a long-term threat.Poulsen said the government was treating the situation with urgency but emphasised that it remained under control. “This was a systematic operation, but there was no immediate military danger,” he said.The drone incursions, coinciding with Denmark’s preparations to host European leaders, have intensified debate over how Nato and the EU should respond to unconventional threats at a time when the war in Ukraine continues to destabilise the region.","Drones seen over several Danish airports, including Aalborg, Esbjerg, Sonderborg and the Skrydstrup air base.

Defence secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned scores of generals and admirals from around the world to meet on short notice next week at a Marine Corps base in Virginia but has not disclosed the reason for the gathering, four US officials said Thursday. The unusual directive, which has been filtering its way through military commands, and the undisclosed rationale, has stirred anxiety among the military's top ranks at a time when Hegseth has fired several senior officers.The officials said the gathering was scheduled for next week, probably Sept 30, at the base in Quantico, Virginia. There are about 800 general-level officers in the armed forces, including 44 at the most senior, four-star level. It was not immediately clear how many of them would be ordered to the gathering, reported earlier by the Washington Post.In May, Hegseth ordered a 20% reduction in four-star officers, continuing the broad job reductions and firings that have marked the first several months of his tenure.Hegseth has already fired more than a dozen military leaders, many of them people of colour and women. Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said Hegseth ""will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.""Top four-star combatant commanders and chiefs of armed services typically meet at least twice a year in Washington, often holding a working dinner with the president. But the large number of generals who could be ordered to Washington, including those working in active conflict zones, is without precedent in recent memory, officials said.","Defence secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned scores of generals and admirals from around the world.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

""It's been enough,"" said US President Donald Trump as he shot down questions about whether he would allow Israel to annex of West Bank.Asked directly about Israel’s suggestions that it could seize control of parts of the territory, he repeated, “I will not allow it. It’s not going to happen.”“I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope. I won’t allow it. It’s not going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.The comments came just as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in New York to address the United Nations before heading to Washington for talks at the White House.The 47th POTUS confirmed he had spoken to Netanyahu earlier in the day, adding: “Yeah, but I’m not going to allow it. Whether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I’m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There’s been enough. It’s time to stop now.”The statement marks one of the rare occasions Trump has broken from Netanyahu, despite his long record of backing Israel, both financially and through defence equipment.Around 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank alongside some 500,000 Israeli settlers, in communities deemed illegal under international law.Netanyahu, under pressure from his nationalist coalition partners, has resisted calls for Palestinian statehood and overseen the expansion of settlements.The comments came after several US allies, including the UK, France and Australia, recognised a Palestinian state in an attempt to revive the stalled two-state solution. Arab leaders, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, had warned Trump that annexation would be a “red line.”Trump’s remarks also came amid Israel’s intensifying military campaign in Gaza, where tens of thousands have died during nearly two years of war with Hamas. Speaking on Thursday, he said he believed progress was being made towards ending the conflict. “We spoke with Bibi Netanyahu today, and we spoke to all the leaders in the Middle East who are great people, and we’re getting pretty close to having a deal on Gaza and maybe even peace,” he said.Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, addressing the UN by video after being denied a US visa, urged countries to continue recognising Palestinian statehood and rejected any role for Hamas in a future government.","'I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.

US President Donald Trump met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir in the White House Oval Office on Thursday in a public embrace of a country he had derided as a deceitful terrorist haven for much of his political career, including during his first term.The White House did not release any details of the meeting, nor were there any statements or readouts, much less a press conference in the hours after the unusual engagement that included ""Field Marshal"" Munir, regarded as the country’s de facto ruler. But a clutch of photos released by the Pakistani government showed Sharif and Munir seated in the gilded Oval Office for talks that were said to have lasted 80 minutes, and later posing with a grinning Trump with his characteristic thumbs up gesture.Trump appeared to be showing a mock up of the White House in a third photo, and in a fourth, secretary of state Marco Rubio is seen guffawing with the Pakistani leaders. The US President also conspicuously wore a pin of a fighter jet along with the trademark American flag. While Pakistan partisans claimed he wore the pin to recognise its downing of Indian aircraft during the recent war, it turned out that he wore it earlier in the day for his meeting with Turkish President Erdogan to press for sale of F-16s and F-35s to Ankara.Shortly before the Pakistan meeting, Trump had boasted about American military manufacturing prowess and said foreign leaders and generals were lining up to visit US factories to buy equipment, without specifically mentioning Pakistan. Erdovan, the leader of Turkey, a NATO ally, had met Trump earlier in the day and Washington has been hawking its military wares to him too.Absent any briefing from either side till the time of writing, speculation raged about the real purpose of the Pakistani meeting, which came soon after Trump had hosted a lunch for Erdogan, who, like with India, was asked by the US to cease purchasing Russian energy. But Pakistan is not a significant economic power, so much of the conjecture centered on Trump’s recent post seeking to retake the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan now under Taliban rule, and also Washington repurposing Islamabad for exploiting its purported mineral wealth. The US also appears to have taken a benign view of the Saudi-Pak defense pact even though it is ostensibly aimed at Israel, arguably the closest US ally.Even Pakistan’s defense minister Khwaja Asif, excluded from the meeting where his Army Chief was present, shed little light on the meeting with a cryptic social media post that read: “Victory over India, defense agreement with Saudi Arabia, and unprecedented progress in Pak-US relations. 2025, a year full of successes, Alhamdulillah. The continuation of the successes of the hybrid system's partnership. Allahu Akbar. ”The meeting, which was scheduled for 4.30 pm, began half an hour late as Trump was busy signing executive orders and bantering with reporters. Shortly before he met the Pakistani duo, he told the White House press corps, ""I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia's doing and what President Putin is doing. I haven't liked it at all...I have solved seven wars. In fact, we have a great leader coming, the prime minister of Pakistan and the field marshal. Field Marshal is a very great guy and so is the prime minister, both, and they're coming, and they may be in this room right now. I don't know, because we're late...they actually maybe somewhere in the Oval Office…behind you.""The fact that he did not mention, or remember, their names was trademark Trump transactional, which some Pakistani analysts opposed to the current regime lit into. ""Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims in his first term alone. His strategy is pure exaggeration. Here, he inflates the stature of a military dictator and his puppet with empty praise, all to conscript their services for his dirty work in Gaza,"" Adil Raja, a retired Pakistani Army officer and a vocal critic of the establishment he once served, said on X.""Calling Pakistan's fascist rulers ""great leaders"" is just the price tag for making them his cleanup crew. Only idiots can celebrate this statement!"" Raja, now a staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and a social media influencer, wrote.Supporters of the current Pakistani dispensation though rejoiced over the country getting back into the good books of the White House after almost two decades of being in the doghouse for its use of terrorist proxies, something even Trump had flagged as far back as 2012 when he was still on the margins of US politics.“When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some 'ally.'"" he posted on July 5, 2012. And on January 1, 2018, during his first term as President: “We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That’s ENDING!""That indeed now appears to have ended, with Pakistan opening up its purported mineral wealth for exploitation, and according to several media accounts, serving as a crypto front for US businesses to milk.","US President Donald Trump met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir in the White House Oval Office.

‘Left-wing terrorism’: Trump orders probe into violent protest funding; justice dept likely to target Soros-backed groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/left-wing-terrorism-trump-orders-probe-into-violent-protest-funding-justice-dept-likely-to-target-soros-backed-groups/articleshow/124139081.cms,"Justice Department directive



Escalation against political opponents



Pushback from civil society groups







US President Donald Trump on Thursday directed his administration to crack down on what he called “left-wing terrorism,” instructing federal agencies to investigate the financial backers of groups he accused of funding violent protests.Trump’s directive placed the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Taskforce in charge of the effort, with involvement from the Treasury Department and other agencies. He said the objective was “to identify and disrupt financial networks that fund domestic terrorism and political violence.”When pressed to name possible targets, Trump pointed to two of the Democratic Party’s most prominent donors, billionaire philanthropists George Soros and Reid Hoffman. “If they are funding these things, they're going to have some problems,” he said.The president’s announcement came weeks after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah and a shooting outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas that left one detainee dead and two others wounded. Authorities have identified suspects in both cases but have not publicly provided evidence of a wider conspiracy or organized funding network.Ahead of Trump’s order, Soros’ Open Society Foundations rejected accusations that it promotes violence. “These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech,” the organization said in a statement. It added, “Our activities are peaceful and lawful.” Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and PayPal, could not be reached for comment.The New York Times reported that a senior Justice Department official has instructed more than half a dozen U.S. attorney’s offices to prepare investigative plans targeting groups funded by Soros. A copy of the directive, viewed by the newspaper, suggested potential charges including arson, racketeering, wire fraud and material support for terrorism.The directive, issued Monday by Aakash Singh, a lawyer in the deputy attorney general’s office, asked prosecutors in California, New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Detroit and Maryland, among others, to review allegations against the Open Society Foundations. It also cited a report by the conservative Capital Research Center, which claimed the foundation “has poured over $80 million into groups tied to terrorism or extremist violence. ” One cited example was al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights group that the Israeli government declared a terrorist organization in 2022.At the time, Open Society Foundations disputed Israel’s designation, saying it was unsupported by credible evidence and was intended to silence human rights defenders.Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the new directive was focused on safety. “This DOJ, along with our hardworking and dedicated U.S. attorneys, will always prioritize public safety and investigate organizations that conspire to commit acts of violence or other federal violations of law,” he said.The move comes as Trump continues to call for investigations into high-profile political adversaries. Over the weekend, he urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to bring charges against former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Both are subjects of separate federal investigations, and grand juries may soon be asked to consider indictments.Trump’s criticism of Soros has intensified since the killing of Kirk. Speaking to NBC News earlier this week, Trump said Soros is “a bad guy” who “should be put in jail.” He has also called for Soros and his son to be prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a law historically used against organized crime. In an August social media post, Trump claimed they should face charges “because of their support for Violent Protest, and much more, all throughout the United States. ”Soros, who began funding pro-democracy initiatives abroad in the 1980s, expanded his Open Society network to the United States in the 1990s. The foundation funds programs supporting human rights, democracy and equity. Critics, including Trump and some Republicans, allege without evidence that the network promotes unrest and violent demonstrations.The Open Society Foundations has joined more than 100 philanthropic organisations in condemning efforts to link its work to political violence. “Organizations should not be attacked for carrying out their missions or expressing their values in support of the communities they serve,” a joint letter said. “We reject attempts to exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work or restrict our fundamental freedoms, like freedom of speech and the freedom to give. ”Last week, the Soros family donated $10 million to Democratic redistricting efforts in California, part of a nationwide battle over congressional maps ahead of future elections.Hoffman, another donor singled out by Trump, has long supported Democratic campaigns and has funded projects opposing online disinformation.The Justice Department’s directive requires prosecutors to determine whether the allegations against Open Society and other groups merit opening criminal investigations. Singh’s memo also asked prosecutors to be ready with plans for grand juries if charges are pursued.For now, Soros’ organisation maintains that its US work is focused only on democratic freedoms. “Our activities are peaceful and lawful,” the foundation said in its latest statement.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday directed his administration to crack down on what he called “left-wing terrorism’ The directive instructs federal agencies to investigate the financial backers of groups he accused of funding violent protests.

Former FBI director and longtime Donald Trump critic James Comey has been indicted on two counts, US media reported Thursday, marking the latest escalation in the president’s campaign of legal action against political adversaries.Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The indictment follows Trump’s public call earlier this week for Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against Comey and other officials.""No one is above the law,"" Bondi said on X after the indictment was announced, without naming Comey. ""Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.""The indictment was filed by Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump who was appointed US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia just days earlier. Halligan has no prior prosecutorial experience. She replaced Erik Siebert, who resigned last week after reportedly telling Justice Department leaders there was insufficient evidence to charge Comey or New York Attorney General Letitia James.James and other Democratic officials have been accused by Trump allies, including Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, of falsifying mortgage documents.Comey was dismissed by Trump in 2017 during an investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. His indictment comes amid a broader crackdown on critics, including former national security advisor John Bolton, whose home and office were raided in August as part of a classified documents probe.Bolton has angered Trump with his memoir,, and frequent public criticism of the president, calling him ""unfit to be president.""Since returning to office in January, Trump has taken punitive steps against perceived opponents, including stripping former officials of security clearances, targeting law firms that handled past cases against him, and cutting federal funding to certain universities.Trump himself has faced multiple investigations. The FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago residence in 2022 over classified documents, and Special Counsel Jack Smith charged him with trying to overturn the 2020 election results. Neither case went to trial, and Smith dropped both after Trump’s victory in the 2024 election, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.","Former FBI director James Comey indicted on two counts of making false statements and obstruction of justice.

Field Marshal is a very great guy, and so is the Prime Minister, both, and they're coming, and they may be in this room right now.”Sharif was among senior officials from eight Islamic nations who met Trump on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly this week to discuss strategies for ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.The meeting follows a trade deal between the US and Pakistan and comes shortly after the leaders briefly met at the UN General Assembly in New York.Meanwhile, in July the US and Pakistan signed a trade deal expected to open up Pakistan’s largely untapped oil reserves to US investment and reduce tariffs for Islamabad.Trump’s intensifying ties with Pakistan are notable because he has previously called the country “a terrorist safe haven” that has deceived the US.Pakistan’s army chief has visited the US twice recently and even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.Trump has frequently claimed he helped in easing out military tensions between India and Pakistan, saying he brokered peace during India's Operation Sindoor in response to the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, has denied any foreign influence in the operation.For Trump, Pakistan is also central to renewed US interest in Afghanistan. He has highlighted the strategic importance of retaking the Bagram Air Base near Kabul, citing its proximity to China’s nuclear assets.",US President Donald Trump met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief Asim Munir in the Oval Office.

Trump Pays Tribute To Kirk, Reveals His Last Plea & Calls Him A ‘Martyr’





US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order approving a deal for the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok to be taken over by a group of American investors, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, allowing the app to continue operating in the US. The signing took place in the Oval Office.Trump emphasized the platform’s importance during his 2024 campaign, saying, “I used it myself during the campaign, and it was very successful.” He also noted the influence of former conservative activist Charlie Kirk , who was assassinated this month, saying Kirk “helped me a lot, too,” and encouraged him to use TikTok to reach voters, as cited by NBC. Charlie helped me a lot too! He said to me, 'you should go on TikTok.' And it actually helped. We got RECORD votes with the young voters!"" Trump said.Highlighting the transition to US ownership, Trump said, “it’s very good and very meaningful, but we have American investors taking it over, running it, highly sophisticated,” adding that they would “play a very big role in terms of security, safety and everything else,” as quoted by NBC.Former President Joe Biden signed legislation last year requiring China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US assets to an American company by early this year or face a nationwide ban.However, Trump has repeatedly issued orders allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US while his administration worked toward a sale agreement.ByteDance currently owns TikTok, but to remain functional in the US, a majority stake will shift to American investors, including Oracle and Silver Lake. ByteDance will retain less than 20 percent equity to comply with the divest-or-ban law and will have one board representative, who will be excluded from security-related matters.Many details of the arrangement remain unclear, but Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “gave us the go-ahead” to proceed with the deal.Vice president JD Vance said the American company that takes ownership of TikTok will be valued at $14 billion. He also emphasized that US investors will ""actually control the algorithm"" of the app.“We actually think this is a good deal for investors, but ultimately the investors are going to make the determination about what they would invest in and what they think is proper value,” Vance added, as reported by NBC News.Neither Vance nor Trump specified the exact buyers of TikTok, but both noted that Oracle will play ""a big part"" in the deal.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order approving a deal for the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok to be taken over by a group of American investors.

US President Donald Trump reiterated his dissatisfaction with Russia’s actions and the leadership of President Vladimir Putin amid escalating conflict with Ukraine.“I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia's doing and what President Putin is doing. I haven't liked it at all...I have solved seven wars,” he said.Trump had said earlier this week that with the backing of the European Union and Nato, Ukraine could potentially reclaim all of its territory. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump described Russia’s war effort as “aimless” and called the country a “paper tiger.”He highlighted the severe economic pressures on Moscow and major Russian cities, noting the hardships faced by ordinary Russians: “the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get gasoline through the long lines that are being formed,” along with other challenges affecting Russia’s war economy, which is dedicating most of its resources to the fight in Ukraine.Trump commented on the US role in the conflict as well, saying that America will continue providing weapons to Nato “for Nato to do what they want with them.” He added, “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.”Trump also mentioned on Thursday an upcoming visit by Pakistani leaders, noting, “in fact, we have a great leader coming, the prime minister of Pakistan and the field marshal.

The gunman who opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas despised the US government and sought to incite terror by killing federal agents, officials said Thursday, revealing the first indication of a motive.The gunman, identified as Joshua Jahn, who ultimately fatally shot himself, “carried out a targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement,” Joseph Rothrock, head of the FBI’s Dallas field office, was quoted as saying by AP.He “specifically intended to kill ICE agents,"" firing at ICE vehicles and sending multiple rounds into ""the windows of the office building where numerous ICE employees do their jobs every day.”The attack took place at daybreak on Wednesday, targeting the ICE building and a van in a gated entryway carrying detainees. One detainee was killed, and two others were critically wounded, though no ICE personnel were injured.The attacker is believed to have acted alone. Nancy Larson, the acting US attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said investigators discovered a series of notes at his residence, including one that read, “yes, it was just me.”Other notes were highly critical of ICE agents and suggested he intended to avoid harming detainees.Larson said investigators have found no evidence linking the gunman to any group or organization. While he expressed a broad hatred of the federal government, she noted he did not mention any federal agency other than ICE.FBI director Kash Patel confirmed on Wednesday that Joshua Jahn was influenced by the rooftop killing of Charlie Kirk, noting that Jahn searched multiple times on September 23 and 24 for “Charlie Kirk Shot video.” Jahn also fired his shots from a nearby rooftop.“The perp downloaded a document titled ‘Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management’ containing a list of DHS facilities,” Patel said.The shooter also left behind a note stating he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” Patel said through a post on X on Thursday.The FBI director shared a photo on social media of a bullet recovered from the scene, marked with the words “ANTI-ICE.” In response, Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide, according to a DHS post on X.The shooting marks the latest high-profile targeted attack in the US, coming just two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot by a rooftop gunman at Utah Valley University. It also unfolds amid heightened immigration enforcement, which has fueled both backlash against ICE agents and growing fear in immigrant communities.","Gunman opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.

D4vd moves out of Hollywood Hills apartment: Why isn't he arrested yet?



Body handed over to family: Is the investigation over?







While the mystery behind 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez's death and her connection with D4vd remain unsolved, the singer's friends have now issued statements claiming that Celeste had many fake IDs and they used to believe that she was 19. The revelations come as the LAPD has not yet made any arrests in Rivas' death, nor has it issued any statement on Rivas' connection to the singer who is now out of the public eye.TMZ reported that D4vd's friends claimed that they saw Celeste at parties and hangouts which had age restrictions, and they thought D4vd and Celeste were a couple. They also believed that Celeste was a student at USC.Several conspiracy theories are doing the rounds as the LAPD has not yet charged D4vd, even after raiding the Hollywood Hills apartment where Celeste used to stay with him. Celeste was reported missing in 2024 until her remains were found in D4vd's Tesla on September 8. But Celeste was not dead long before as a neighbor claimed that he saw Celeste with D4vd weeks before her body was found.The neighbor claimed that the Tesla apparently met with an accident and D4vd did not repair it and eventually dumped it.Celeste had a habit of running away from her troubled home and speculations are rife whether Celeste fled from D4vd's house also and met with some accident, or if that's what D4vd told the cops to distance himself from the death.But the body was found at D4vd's car and it's not yet known how things are adding up for the investigators.Meanwhile, D4vd's manager ended the lease agreement for the apartment where many believe Celeste was murdered. They have started moving their belongings out as well.The police handed over the rotting body of Rivas to the family for the funeral without answering the mysteries surrounding the death. The body was rotting when it was found on September 8, as it was reported to the police because of a foul smell. It was already attracting flies and it took almost a week to establish the identity. Officials could even determine the clothes that Rivas was wearing when she died. But they have not revealed the cause of death and the date of death yet.",D4vd's friends said they thought Celeste Rivas was his girlfriend and that she was 19.

The Pentagon is convening a rare gathering of top US military leaders next week in Quantico, Virginia. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned senior commanders from around the world, though the purpose of the meeting remains unclear.""People are scrambling to change their plans and see if they have to attend,"" a source was quoted as saying by Reuters.Many senior military officials, who often command thousands of troops and maintain schedules planned weeks in advance, face disrupted plans due to the meeting. It remains unclear how many will attend, but gatherings of this scale, with so many top officials in one room, is a rare occurrence.“The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,” Pentagon spokesperson Parnell’s office said. The office did not respond to questions regarding the number of officers attending, the purpose of the meeting, or why Hegseth issued the abrupt summons.A meeting of this scale is highly unusual and would typically be conducted via secure video teleconference, as roughly 800 generals and admirals are stationed across the US and globally.The order targets senior officers at the rank of brigadier general or higher, or their Navy equivalents, along with their top enlisted advisers, as cited by the Washington Post.The US maintains troops worldwide, including in distant locations such as South Korea, Japan, and across the Middle East, under the command of two, three, and four star generals and admirals.Hegseth has rapidly reshaped the defence department, dismissing top generals and admirals to advance Trump’s national security agenda and eliminate diversity initiatives he deems discriminatory.Last month, Hegseth removed the head of the Pentagon’s intelligence agency along with two other senior military commanders.In May, Hegseth issued a directive to cut roughly 100 generals and admirals, including a ""minimum"" 20 percent reduction among four-star officers. He also ordered an additional 10 percent reduction in general and flag officers across the military.""More generals and admirals does not lead to more success,"" Hegseth said at the time, as reported by Reuters.","Pentagon convenes rare gathering of top US military leaders next week in Quantico, Virginia.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan.

Poll Do you believe that security measures for trains in Balochistan are adequate? Yes, they are sufficient No, they need improvement





At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.
