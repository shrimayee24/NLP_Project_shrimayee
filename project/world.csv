Police and BMC officials hit by slum dwellers in Powai's Jai Bhim Nagar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/police-and-bmc-officials-hit-by-slum-dwellers-in-powais-jai-bhim-nagar/articleshow/110775046.cms,"MUMBAI: Over a thousand locals of Powai's Jai Bhim Nagar watched their homes being torn down by the authorities on Thursday afternoon. The anger and frustration led to stone pelting between the civic and police authorities, videos of which went viral. Bharat Suryavanshi , assistant commissioner of police was among the 15 police personnel who got injured. Additionally, five civic engineers and five labourers appointed by BMC also faced injuries.In retaliation the police also started beating up those who were barring the demolition works while some were taken to the nearby police station. Kavita Thorat, a slum dweller said that her teenage daughter was taken away by the police. ""You assault us but don't touch our kids. My 18 year old daughter was taken away by the police only for continuing to stay in the houses we have lived in for the past many years,"" said Thorat.“Women with photos of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, politicians, and gods carried along with them stayed in the front to avoid the officials from entering. Knowing about the demolition they were ready with stones and construction scraps that were used to attack the officials,” said a police officer of the Powai police station.At the site on Thursday TOI found angry residents pleading with the authorities to go inside their homes to bring their belongings. However fearing the worst again the police barred any entry into the area where the demolition was taking place. “The stone pelting lasted for over 30 minutes before an additional police force of 500 (SRPF, Rapid Action Force and Quick Response Team) were called to the spot,” said the police officer.BMC commissioner Bhushan Gagrani reached the site in wake of reports that civic staff had been beaten up. ""Attacks on municipal employees during this operation will never be tolerated. The employees were assured that the administration stands firmly behind them,"" said a statement issued by the BMC.Further the civic body said that multiple notices under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act 1966 section 55 were given previously to the slum dwellers. Under Section 55 of the MRTP Act, if a person has carried out any development of a temporary nature unauthorizedly, the Planning Authority may by an order direct that person to remove the said structure or work erected within 15 days of receipt of the order.""A Labor Hutment with about 500 huts was constructed on a plot of land in a temporary manner in the year 2007. But then the State Human Rights Commission had directed the BMC to take action against these huts. Also notices were issued to the occupiers of these huts on June 1, as per the provisions of Section 488 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888. It was stated in this notice that if these encroachments are not removed by themselves within 48 hours, they will be removed by the BMC. This means that the BMC completed the prescribed procedure and also gave sufficient time by giving advance notice,"" said the civic body.However authorities said that the temporary shelter location was later grabbed by over 400 more people who built the huts. Police on Thursday were in the process of registering a first information report (FIR) against the slum dwellers for unlawful assembly, rioting, deterring public servants from performing duty, endangering life, and other Indian Penal Code sectionFormer Congress MLA from the area Naseem Khan said that the due process of law was not followed by the BMC before taking the action. ""No time was given to the slum dwellers to reply to the notice. The slum dwellers should have been given a hearing before the demolition was started. These are protected homes and the slum dwellers should have first been rehabilitated before they were removed from their houses,"" said Khan.However, BMC said that the eviction of all the slums will continue. Aarti Atish Patnik said that how could the authorities throw them off the homes before monsoons. ""Kids schools have started and the rains will start in no time.

Nine of those calls ended with a patient needing treatment in a hospital. A spokesperson for the county said the number is likely higher, as the heat can also play a role in other types of calls to the fire department, including those related to alcohol intoxication or when conditions like fainting, dizziness, or nausea are reported.New record highs Thursday included 113 F (45 C) in Phoenix, breaking the old mark of 111 F (44 C) set in 2016, and 111 F (44 C) in Las Vegas, topping the 110 F (43 C) last reached in 2010. Other areas of Arizona, California, and Nevada also broke records by a few degrees.The heat has arrived weeks earlier than usual even in places farther to the north at higher elevations — areas typically a dozen degrees cooler. That includes Reno, Nevada, where the normal high of 81 F (27 C) for this time of year soared to a record 98 F (37 C) on Thursday.The National Weather Service in Reno forecasted mild cooling this weekend, but only by a few degrees.

Hunter Biden told lover he was a ‘drunk and an addict’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-told-lover-he-was-a-drunk-and-an-addict/articleshow/110781328.cms,"Hunter Biden , the only surviving son of President Joe Biden , admitted to being a drug and alcohol addict to his former lover and sent her texts within hours of purchasing a gun indicating that he was buying and using crack cocaine .The dramatic testimony highlighted the fourth day of Hunter Biden’s trial in Delaware on the charges brought by Special Counsel David Weiss over his purchase of a gun in mid-October 2018. Separately, Biden’s father said he doesn’t intend to pardon his son if he’s convicted of federal firearms violations.Hallie Biden , Hunter’s sister-in-law who later became his lover, testified that she regularly begged him to go into treatment for crack cocaine and alcohol addiction. But he kept “running away like a child,” she said.“This has all got to stop,” Hallie Biden said she told Hunter. “Check yourself into a rehab.” She had been married to Hunter’s brother Beau, who died of cancer in 2015. She later had a romantic relationship with Hunter, who is accused of illegally buying and possessing a gun while using drugs.Hallie Biden said she personally saw him smoke crack on several occasions and even joined him in using the drug during the summer of 2018. But she became fearful after finding the pistol in his car. She said she didn’t want him to hurt himself or for her children to get their hands on the weapon, so she threw it in a grocery store trash can.Hunter Biden acknowledged in a text to her shortly after buying the pistol that he was a “drunk and an addict.” That’s potentially useful testimony for prosecutors trying to convince jurors that he was in the throes of drug use when he bought the gun and checked “no” on a federal form asking if he was a user of illegal drugs.Prosecutors pointed to two texts that Hunter Biden sent Hallie after he bought the gun on Oct. 12, 2018. In one Oct. 23 text, Hunter Biden said he was waiting for a “dealer named Mookie” in Wilmington, Delaware. In a text on Oct. 14, he wrote, “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack.” Hunter’s lawyers have argued that perhaps he was lying in the texts.In testimony that could help his defense, Hallie Biden wasn’t able to say whether Hunter Biden was on drugs the day he bought the gun. She said she couldn’t recall seeing Hunter Oct. 6 to Oct. 12. She also said she did not see him use drugs between Oct. 12 and Oct. 23.Meanwhile, the president said he’d respect the jury’s verdict in the case and had ruled out a pardon for his son if he’s convicted, according to a transcript of an interview the elder Biden did with ABC World News Tonight anchor David Muir.Prosecutors in the gun case say they only have to show that Hunter Biden was a user of illegal drugs around the time he bought the gun. Hunter Biden’s lawyers argue that Hunter didn’t knowingly lie when he filled out the form and bought the gun.Hallie Biden is a key witness for the prosecution. After her husband’s death, she had an affair with Hunter Biden while he was married to another woman.Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter’s vehicle 11 days after he bought it. She said she had gone into the car to clean it out, but discovered “some remnants of crack cocaine and some paraphernalia” and then the gun. She put the gun in a pouch she found in the vehicle, which prosecutors say later was tested and determined to have traces of cocaine.In describing how she disposed of the gun, she said, “I realize it was a stupid move now, but I was in a panic.”Hallie Biden said she wasn’t sure if Hunter Biden was using drugs on the day she found the gun, but said he exhibited signs of it that included looking like he hadn’t slept in awhile.As for her own drug use, Hallie Biden said she stopped in August 2018.“It was a terrible experience that I went through and I’m embarrassed and ashamed,” she said. “I regret that portion of my life.”Hunter Biden’s gun was found in a trashcan by an elderly man who regularly picked through trash for recyclable materials he could sell. Prosecutors called the man, Edward Banner, as a witness. Banner said after he found the gun and the pouch, he took them home, put them in a closet and never touched them again. He later turned the gun and pouch over to a police detective who tracked him down.Prosecutors asked Banner if anyone in his house used cocaine, to which he said no. That’s a potentially important piece of evidence if Hunter Biden’s defense tries to argue that the trace cocaine found on the pouch was put there after the gun was thrown away.",Hunter Biden admitted to being a drug and alcohol addict to his former lover. He sent her texts within hours of purchasing a gun indicating that he was buying and using crack cocaine.

Nato stands with Ukraine like US backed Europe against Nazis: Biden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nato-stands-with-ukraine-like-us-backed-europe-against-nazis-biden/articleshow/110780368.cms,"NORMANDY: US Prez Joe Biden observed the 80th anniversary of D-Day on the beaches of Normandy on Thursday by asserting that the allied effort to stand up to Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine is a direct extension of the battle for freedom that raged across Europe during World War II.Addressing 180 surviving veterans of the Normandy operation and thousands of other guests, Biden said that the world must defeat another “tyrant bent on domination” and meet “the test of ages” to defend Ukraine — just as the heroes who stormed the beaches and dropped behind enemy lines did eight decades ago.“Isolation was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,” Biden said, with WWII veterans seated in wheelchairs behind him. “We know the dark forces that these heroes fought against 80 years ago. They never fade. Aggression and greed, the desire to dominate and control, to change borders by force — these are perennial. The struggle between dictatorship and freedom is unending.”In an energetic address, Biden declared that “Nato is more united than ever” and insisted that the alliance would stand by Ukraine in its own hour of need just as the US had stood by Europe against the Nazis. “We will not walk away,” Biden said. “Because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there.”The president spoke just steps from where 9,388 members of the American military are buried, most of whom participated in the Allied invasion at Omaha Beach. Their graves are marked with rows of stark white marble crosses or Stars of David, which gleamed under the bright sunlight and blue skies.Biden, 81, who was a toddler when American, British and Canadian troops poured onto the beaches here on June 6, 1944, will almost certainly be the last US president to speak at a Normandy remembrance who was alive at the time Allied forces began to push Adolf Hitler out of Europe.Now, eight decades later, Biden is leading a coalition of European and other nations in a very different war on the continent, but for a very similar principle — pushing back against the attempted seizure of a neighbouring country, in this case Ukraine, by Prez Vladimir Putin of Russia.In his remarks on Thursday at the Normandy American Cemetery, Biden drew a direct line between the two, connected by the defence of a rules-based international order. “The men who fought here became heroes not because they were the strongest, the toughest or the fiercest — although they were,” Biden said, “but because they were given an audacious mission, knowing — every one of them knew — the probability of dying was real.” “They knew beyond any doubt there are things that are worth fighting and dying for,” Biden added. “Freedom is worth it. Democracy is worth it. America is worth it. The world is worth it. Then, now and always.”",US Prez Joe Biden observed the 80th anniversary of D-Day on the beaches of Normandy on Thursday.

‘Smoked crack every 20 min’: US prez son’s drug-fuelled past laid bare in court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/smoked-crack-every-20-min-us-prez-sons-drug-fuelled-past-laid-bare-in-court/articleshow/110780418.cms,"Brother’s widow details tossing the revolver

(With AP/Reuters inputs)

Hunter Biden ’s ex-wife and a former girlfriend testified Wednesday in his gun trial about finding his crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia , and jurors saw photos of the prez’s son bare-chested in a bubble bath and heard about his visit to a strip club.As first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row, the courtroom grew quiet when Kathleen Buhle , who was married to Hunter for 20 years, walked in. She testified that she discovered her husband was using drugs when she found a crack pipe in an ashtray on July 3, 2015, a day after their anniversary. When she asked him, “he acknowledged smoking crack,” she said. “I was definitely worried, scared,” said Buhle, who divorced him in 2016 after his infidelity and drug abuse became too much.The trial, about whether he lied on a gun purchase form in Oct 2018 when he said he wasn’t using drugs, has become a highly personal and detailed tour of the mistakes and drug use of Hunter, whose struggles have been tabloid fodder for years and were used publicly by Republicans, including for an impeachment bid against US prez.The proceedings are unfolding as the 2024 election looms, and allies worry about the toll it will take on Prez Biden. Hunter has been charged with three felonies: Lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. Prosecutors have said Hunter was a habitual user, unable to stay clean for long and had been kicked out of the US navy after testing positive for cocaine.Prosecutors also called Zoe Kestan, who testified about meeting Hunter in 2017 at a strip club where she worked. She described Hunter’s drug-fuelled lifestyle during 2018, including when they stayed at an expensive hotel for a month. Kestan said he was often smoking crack about every 20 minutes. The prosecution showed photos of him with crack pipes, including one of him in a soapy bathtub. But she conceded she didn’t see Hunter using drugs during the month when he bought the gun because the two were estranged at that time. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in jail, though first-time offenders get a far more lenient punishment.The widow of Hunter Biden’s brother told jurors in his federal gun trial on Thursday about the moment she found the revolver in his truck, describing how she put it into a leather pouch, stuffed it into a shopping bag and tossed it in a trash can outside a market near her home. “I panicked, and I wanted to get rid of them,” Hallie Bidentestified about finding the gun and ammunition in Oct 2018.“I didn’t want him to hurt himself, and I didn’t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.” The purchase of the Colt revolver by Hunter — and Hallie’s frenzied disposal of it — are the fulcrum of the case against him. Prosecutors say the prez’s son was in the throes of a heavy crack addiction when he bought the gun. Hallie, who had a brief romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau Biden died, said she considered hiding the gun but thought her kids might find it, so she decided to throw it away. “I realise it was a stupid idea now.” Asked by the prosecutor if Hunter was using drugs around then, she said, “He could have been.”","Hunter Biden’s ex-wife and a former girlfriend testified Wednesday in his gun trial about finding his crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia.

Donald Trump quickly surpasses Joe Biden on TikTok with just one video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-quickly-surpasses-joe-biden-on-tiktok-with-just-one-video/articleshow/110752526.cms,"In a move that has quickly gained traction, former US President Donald Trump made his debut on TikTok last Saturday. The video, featuring Trump alongside Dana White, the CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, was captured before their attendance at the recent UFC fights in Newark. Despite being his inaugural post, it has already amassed an impressive 5.9 million likes, while his account has attracted 5.6 million followers in just four days.

Content on TikTok about Trump has generally outperformed posts focused on Biden in recent months.

Former President Donald Trump posted his first video to TikTok on Saturday, and has already amassed more followers and likes than President Joe Biden ’s campaign account as the two men vie for attention before November’s general election.

Trump’s first post, which showed him standing next to Ultimate Fighting Championship Chief Executive Officer Dana White before attending this past weekend’s slate of fights in Newark, has garnered 5.9 million likes, and his account has 5.6 million followers after just four days. Biden’s campaign account, which has posted hundreds of videos since its debut in February, has just 361,000 followers and 4.7 million likes.

Trump’s campaign trumpeted the contrast in a press release on Wednesday, highlighting his popularity on an app that he tried to ban four years ago while he was in office.

He has since come out in support of TikTok, which faces a possible ban in the US if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., does not divest its ownership stake in the platform by Jan. 19. Biden, who signed the law that could eventually ban TikTok on grounds that the app poses a security risk to American users, is still using the platform to campaign.

Content on TikTok about Trump has generally outperformed posts focused on Biden in recent months, although performance varies based on the news cycle, according to Ben Darr, the founder of CredoIQ, a social media analytics firm.

The Biden campaign said it was continuing to bolster its presence on social media platforms, including TikTok and Instagram, and committed to spending millions of dollars on digital investments as well as forging bonds with influencers.

Both candidates are using TikTok to appeal to young voters. TikTok claims it has 170 million monthly users in the US, and its parent company is vigorously fighting in court the divest-or-ban law.

WASHINGTON: Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, according to a Western official familiar with the matter. The weapons were used under recently approved guidance from President Joe Biden allowing American arms to be used to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv , Ukraine’s second-largest city. The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Biden’s directive allows for US-supplied weapons to be used to strike Russian forces that are attacking or preparing to attack. It does not change US policy that directs Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia, US officials have said.

Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US to allow Kyiv’s forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv sits just 20km from the Russian border and has come under intensified Russian attack.

On Tuesday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that he could not confirm that Ukraine had used US weapons at targets in Russia. “We’re just not in a position on a day-to-day basis of knowing exactly what the Ukrainians are firing at what. It’s certainly at a tactical level.”

Police officers arrested 13 pro-Palestinian protesters Wednesday who had barricaded themselves in the office of the prez of Stanford University and demanded that administrators meet several demands, including a vote by the university trustees on whether to divest from companies that are said to support Israel’s military.

The administration offices, located in Building 10, were cleared within about three hours, according to a campus spokesperson, who said that there was “extensive damage.” Several walls and pillars on the exterior were covered in graffiti that criticised the police, Stanford and Israel. One officer was injured during the arrests, the spokesperson said, adding that any students who were arrested will be suspended and those who are seniors will not be allowed to graduate.Wednesday is the final day of classes for spring.

(With Reuters inputs)

TEL AVIV: Israel organised and paid for an influence campaign last year targeting US lawmakers and the American public with pro-Israel messaging , as it aimed to foster support for its actions in the war in the Gaza Strip , according to officials involved in the effort and documents related to the operation.The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs , a govt body that connects Jews around the world with the state of Israel, four Israeli officials said. The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoic , a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out, according to the officials and the documents.The campaign began in Oct and remains active on the social platform X. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments. The accounts focused on US lawmakers, particularly ones who are black and Democrats, with posts urging them to continue funding Israel’s military.ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites featuring pro-Israel articles.The Israeli govt’s connection to the influence operation, which NYT verified with four current and ex-members of ministry of diaspora affairs and documents about the campaign, has not previously been reported. FakeReporter, an Israeli misinformation watchdog, identified the effort in March.Last week, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said they had also found and disrupted the operation. The campaign didn’t have a widespread impact, the two companies had said. The fake accounts accumulated more than 40,000 followers across X, Facebook and Instagram, FakeReporter found. But many of those followers may have been bots and didn’t generate a large audience, Meta said.The secretive drive signals the lengths Israel was willing to go to sway American opinion on the war in Gaza. The US has long been one of Israel’s staunchest allies, with Prez Biden recently signing a $15 billion military aid package for the country. But the conflict has been unpopular with many Americans, who have called for Biden to withdraw support for Israel in the face of mounting civilian deaths in Gaza. Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs denied involvement. Stoic didn’t respond for comment.Israel reiterated on Wednesday its refusal to halt the Gaza offensive for a resumption of hostage-release talks with Hamas, after mediator Qatar said it had given the Palestinian militants a US-backed truce proposal. “Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,” defence minister Yoav Gallant, said in remarks after he flew abroad a warplane to inspect the Gaza front. On the other hand, Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh said the group will deal “seriously and positively” with any agreement that is based on the total halt of war, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.","The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs. The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoic, a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110751695,imgsize-1771130,width-400,resizemode-4/110751695.jpg"

BERLIN: A municipal candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany party was slashed with a box cutter in the German city of Mannheim , authorities said Wednesday. While police said the incident on Tuesday night did not appear to be politically motivated, it came four days after a knife attack on members of an anti-Islam party in the same city, which raised concerns about more violence in the prelude to Sunday’s vote in Germany for the European Parliament .

Tuesday’s attack occurred after Heinrich Koch , running for municipal office in Mannheim, noticed a man “taking down and slashing” AfD posters. After Koch confronted him, the man attacked Koch with a box cutter.

Koch was taken to a hospital for stitches but is expected to make a full recovery.

Taiwan strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.The United States has expressed concern about Chinese military activity near Taiwan, including after the island's presidential election and the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te last month. China has warned the US should not interfere in China's affairs with Taiwan.Taiwan and the United States have no official diplomatic relationship, as Washington formally recognises Beijing but is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and is the island's most important international backer.The United States recognized that if China was successful in annexing Taiwan it would impact US credibility and have ""profound, and potentially irreversible effect on the perceived reliability of US alliances worldwide"", Rudd said.The United States, China and Taiwan have a common interest in avoiding open military confrontation on the future of Taiwan, said Rudd, a China scholar who was president of the Asia Society in New York until last year.""The economic costs, domestic political impacts, and unknowable geo-strategic consequences that such a war would generate would likely be of an order of magnitude that we have not seen since the Second World War,"" he said.""Whatever the outcome (an American victory, a Chinese victory, or a bloody stalemate), the world is likely to become a radically different place after such a war than it was before.""","Kevin Rudd, Australia's ambassador to the U.S., says a war over Taiwan would be as great as the impact of the Second World War.

Asked about ways he would curb the flow of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally, Trump said: ""We have tremendous economic power."" Trump said if a country, such as China, does not help to curb the flow of immigrants in to the U.S., ""we have these things called tariffs.""

Trump added he hoped he would not need to use tariffs to curb illegal immigration , but warned if other countries do not help to reduce it, then he could ""tariff the hell out of that country"" if re-elected.

FBI director warns of Moscow-like attack in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-director-warns-of-moscow-like-attack-in-us/articleshow/110774536.cms,"NEW DELHI: FBI director Christopher Wray has alerted lawmakers to the increasing risk of a coordinated jihadist attack on American soil , akin to the deadly assault at Russia's Crocus City Hall . Speaking to a US Senate committee on Tuesday, Wray emphasized the need for heightened funding to bolster counter-terrorism efforts.

Wray's testimony outlined the severity of the terrorist threat, citing the March 22 attack at the Crocus concert venue near Moscow, which resulted in 145 deaths and over 500 injuries. The assailants, identified as Tajikistani nationals, used firearms and explosives to wreak havoc, leading to a devastating fire that trapped many victims. Russian authorities have implicated Ukrainian military intelligence, alleging the use of Islamist proxies.

""Just in the time that I’ve been FBI director, we’ve disrupted multiple terrorist attacks in cities and communities around the country,"" Wray stated. ""We need funding to continue protecting America from terrorism."" The FBI has requested a 6.2% budget increase to $11.3 billion for the next fiscal year, a move that comes amid Republican efforts to cut spending, a Russia Today report said.

Wray also highlighted the escalation of terrorist threats in the US following the onset of the Israel-Hamas war last October. He pointed to a ""rogues’ gallery of terrorist groups"" that have called for attacks on the US and its allies. ""Given those calls for action, our most immediate concern has been that individuals or small groups will draw a twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home,"" Wray explained. ""But now, on top of that, increasingly concerning is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, not unlike the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russian concert hall back in March.""

The US has experienced a 60% increase in hate crimes, primarily targeting Jewish individuals, since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Wray noted that Jewish communities have been particularly vulnerable, facing threats from both domestic extremists and jihadists influenced by foreign terrorist organizations. ""They have the tragic distinction of really being targeted by almost every type of terrorist organization there is out there, foreign and domestic, across the spectrum,"" Wray said. ""And so, they desperately need our help, and we’re going to give it to them.""

An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.

“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.

Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.

Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.

The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.

Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan sentenced to 10 years in prison.

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live.
