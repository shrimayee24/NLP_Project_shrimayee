Efforts by retired police officers and Punjab officials to persuade Dallewal to accept medical aid have so far failed.The SC panel, formed on Sept 2, had invited SKM to discuss farmer-related issues - such as MSP, institutional debt, and rising input costs.

BATHINDA: A nine-hour shutdown called by farmers' unions fighting for a legally guaranteed minimum support price mechanism for crops struck Punjab off the transport map Monday, with buses going off the road and 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.Thousands of stranded passengers spent the day at railway stations without functioning food stalls, while those who picked alternative transport ran into roadblocks at various places.SKM (non-political) and KMM had called for a shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm, barring even supply of milk and vegetables. Emergency services were exempted.Altercations between protesters and travellers inconvenienced by the strike were reported at some locations. A cancer patient from Gujarat and his wife were stranded at Ferozepur railway station en route Dharamshala in Himachal. The man's wife said she didn't find an eatery or a stall open to buy food, let alone give her husband the diet he has been medically advised to follow.In Faridkot, protesters allegedly abused and threatened primary block education officer Jagtar Singh for keeping his office open.Farm activist Sarvan Singh Pandher said organisations enforcing the strike had sought public support and people of the state spontaneously responded to it, making the bandh ""complete and peaceful"".Fellow activists Kaka Singh Kotda and Surjit Singh Phool said senior members of the farm lobby stayed put at Khanauri border protest site on Punjab-Haryana border as they were worried about safety of fasting farmer Jagjit Singh Dallewal.Punjab administration made another futile attempt at convincing the farmer to receive medical assistance ahead of Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the matter.Retired additional DGP Jaskaran Singh, accompanied by DIG (Patiala range) Mandeep Singh Sidhu and Patiala SSP Nanak Singh, held a series of meetings with farm activists at Khanauri since Sunday. Jaskaran Singh also met Dallewal. The latter only agreed to give blood samples for testing.In a short video after the strike ended, Dallewal thanked people of Punjab for backing the bandh. He also expressed gratitude to the volunteers by his side.Amid calls for unity till farm unions' demands are accepted, rival factions announced parallel kisan mahapanchayats on Jan 4 at two venues 27km apart.

Who was the attacker? What we know about the attack



Some reports claimed that the attacker was 42-year-old Shamsud Din Jabbar, a Texas man, though there was no official confirmation. FBI confirmed that the attacker was dead after he killed at least 10 people, injured around 30 and fired at two cops from his truck. The attacker used a white truck for this New Year horror. It has a Texas number plate. Newsweek reported that the truck was purchased in August. The truck had a black flag on the back. Fox News reported that the truck was tracked crossing the southern border into the US at Eagle Pass, Texas, two days prior to the attack. It is not yet known whether the attacker was driving the vehicle when it crossed the border. His immigration status is yet unknown. The attacker could be a Mexican but there is no official word on it. It was not an incident of DUI but the attacker was intentional and hell-bent to kill as many people as he could. There were police barricades but the killer drove through the barricades. The driver was travelling at a very fast pace. Investigators do not think he was impaired or he did anything accidentally. The killer's truck was stopped after crashing into a crane in the middle of the street. Some reports claimed the suspect was wearing bullet-proof body armor though there is no confirmation. Fox News said the attacker jumped out of the vehicle and opened fire on police after hitting the crowd. The brief shootout ended with the attacker's death. The FBI statement said the ""subject then engaged with local law enforcement and is now deceased"" -- hinting that the police had probably a face-off with the killer.

A driver, 'hell-bent' on 'carnage' rammed a truck into reveling crowds on New Orleans' famous Bourbon Street turning the New Year into a tragedy. 10 were killed and around 30 were injured hours after the revelers celebrated the New Year. The FBI has taken up the investigation and is now probing it as an act of terrorism as several IEDs were found on the spot. President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement condemning the attack and said his administration will do everything to support the investigation into this ""act of evil"". ""When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,"" Trump said.","Truck used to crush 10 people at a New Year gathering in New Orleans had a black flag and Texas numberplate.

Around 10 days after the woman was set on fire in a bone-chilling incident on the New York Subway, Debrina Kawam was identified through fingerprints and DNA sampling as not much of her remains were left to establish her identity. The woman was a homeless person who took shelter inside the subway train to save herself from the biting cold outside only to be set on fire by illegal Guatemalan migrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil who did not even remember the moment he set the woman on fire out of intoxication. The world could not see a photo of Debrina apart from the shocking footage of her standing helplessly in the fire. And now an old high school yearbook photo of the 57-year-old woman surfaced.According to reports, Debrina Kawam, known to her classmates as Debbie or Deb graduated from Passaic Valley Regional School in Little Falls, New Jersey, in 1985.According to her high school yearbook biography, she earned the fame of a ""million dollar smile"" in the school. Her best memories at the public school were participating in freshman and sophomore cheerleading and her secret ambition was to ""party forever"".As social media users mourned the pathetic and painful death of Debrina Kawam who was not even identified until 10 days after the incident, they said Debrina Kawam was more than just a homeless person and she did not deserve this death. A New York Post report said Kawam made a bankruptcy filing in 2008 in which she mentioned that she had not worked due to illness.Debrina was sleeping when Sebastian Zapeta-Calil boarded the train and set her blanket on fire. There were layers of clothing on Debrina and Zapeta-Calil fanned the fire with a shirt. In the surveillance video, Debrina was seen sitting motionless as the fire was engulfing her. Police found a walker later at the crime scene and confirmed that Debrina had a mobility issue and could not run the fire. She could stand up only when she was completely burned and the perpetrator witnessed his victim burning from outside the train.","Debrina Kawam, 57, was a homeless person who took shelter inside the subway train to save herself from the biting cold outside.

FBI statement on Shamsud-Din Jabbar



Within hours of the deadly attack in New Orleans that turned the New Year into a tragedy as 10 people were mowed down by a killer truck, the FBI identified the suspect as 42-year-old Shamsud Din Jabbar of Texas. After crushing the New Year revelers, Jabbar opened fire at the police leading to a brief shootout in which he died. His truck had an ISIS flag at the time of the dastardly attack, the FBI confirmed. FBI said Jabbar may not have acted alone and the investigators are now looking into the possibility of someone who helped him in the carnage. ""We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates,"" they added, calling on the public to reach out if they have had any interactions with the 42-year-old Texas native, who officials say served in the military for 10 years.Jabbar was a Texas man, born and brought up in Texas. The killer truck also had a Texas number plate. ""An ISIS flag was located in the vehicle and the FBI is working to determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations with terrorist organizations. Weapons and a potential IED were located in the subject’s vehicle.

But it was not known whether Jabbar was driving the truck at that time. This revelation led to speculation whether the New Orleans attacker was a migrant but the FBI confirmed later that Jabbar was a Texas man -- a US citizen.The truck was listed on the car rental site Turo.Hours after the incident, New Orleans police chief Anne Kirkpatrick said it was not an incident of DUI; the attacker was intentional in killing as many people as he could and he was ""hell-bent"" on creating a carnage.""The subject has been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US citizen from Texas.

Who was Shamsud-Din Jabbar?

Financial struggles and personal crisis

The attack and victims

Motive still unknown

The FBI has identified 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US Army veteran from Texas, as the suspect behind the deadly attack in New Orleans on New Year's Day. Jabbar, a native of Beaumont, Texas, is accused of driving a Ford pickup truck that killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more.The attack, which ended in a gunfight with police, has left the city grappling with both grief and uncertainty over the motivations behind the violence.The FBI found an ISIS flag inside the truck used in the attack, raising questions about Jabbar's potential ties to terrorist organizations. The agency is investigating whether the suspect had any affiliations with terrorist groups, as well as the overall intent behind the attack.Alongside the flag, several weapons and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were recovered, including a handgun and an AR-style rifle. Authorities are also working to confirm how Jabbar acquired the rented vehicle used in the crime.Jabbar's background is revealing, yet puzzling. According to the FBI, he was honorably discharged from the US Army after serving in roles as a human resources and IT specialist. He had previously worked for major organizations, including Deloitte, earning approximately $120,000 annually. Despite these stable credentials, Jabbar's personal life appears to have been marked by turmoil.His ex-wife, Nakedra Charrlle, and her current husband, Dwayne Marsh, spoke to the New York Times about Jabbar's recent erratic behavior, particularly after he converted to Islam. Marsh recalled that Jabbar had been ""acting crazy"" in the months leading up to the attack, which led him to stop allowing Jabbar's two daughters from visiting him. In a 2020 YouTube video, Jabbar discussed his background in real estate, emphasizing his military service and his lifelong ties to Beaumont.Jabbar's financial difficulties were also well-documented. Court records revealed he was facing significant financial pressures, including a $27,000 overdue home payment. He had incurred $16,000 in credit card debt to cover legal fees during his second divorce, a situation that appeared to weigh heavily on him in the months before the attack. These personal struggles, however, do not provide clear insight into what drove him to such extreme violence.The attack on New Year's Day has shocked the city. Jabbar's assault, which was reportedly carried out with explosive devices in key locations of New Orleans’ French Quarter, left dozens of victims, some of whom remain critically injured. Among the deceased were 18-year-old Nikyra Cheyenne Dedeaux, 28-year-old former Princeton football player Tiger Bech, and 37-year-old Reggie Hunter, a Baton Rouge father of two. Hunter's family described him as a loving father and a kind-hearted individual who ""didn't deserve this.""The condition of many victims remains unclear, though two police officers injured during the gunfire exchange are reportedly in stable condition.As the investigation continues, the FBI is probing whether Jabbar's attack was an act of terrorism , citing the presence of an ISIS flag and the discovery of IEDs. However, authorities have yet to determine the full scope of his motivations. While some suggest personal financial struggles or extremist influences may have played a role, the full picture remains elusive.For many, the devastating loss of life underscores the brutality of the assault. Shirell Jackson, a cousin of one of the victims, said, ""Whether it was a terrorist or Joe Blow... from whatever, Louisiana, what they done was horrible. They devastated so many lives.""","Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the suspect behind the New Orleans attack.

Law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating this as well, including whether there's any possible connection with the attack in New Orleans,"" Joe Biden said.Biden assured that every resource is being utilized to ensure there is no threat to the American people.""I directed my team to make sure every resource is made available to federal, state and local law enforcement to complete the investigation in New Orleans quickly and to make sure there is no remaining threat to the American people,"" he said.In a statement, Turo said it was working with authorities.“We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,"" the statement said.The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X.

Place of attack

A US Army veteran driving a pickup truck displaying the flag of the Islamic State terrorist group caused a deadly incident during New Orleans’ New Year’s celebrations. He drove around a police barricade and into a crowd, killing 15 people before being shot by police.US President Joe Biden called the act “despicable” and expressed sympathy for the victims and their families. Addressing the nation from Camp David, he said, ""I want you to know I grieve with you. Our nation grieves with you as you mourn and as you heal."" Biden confirmed that the driver had posted videos on social media expressing inspiration from the Islamic State group .""The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, especially a desire to kill,"" Biden said, adding, ""The Isis flag was found in his vehicle, which he rented to conduct this attack.""The driver used a rented Ford pickup truck and had additional IEDs. His Airbnb, located about 1.5 miles from the attack site, burned down earlier the same day. The FBI continues to investigate.Joe Biden also said that authorities were probing ""any possible connection"" between a deadly truck-ramming attack in New Orleans and the explosion of a Cybertruck outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas.Law enforcement are investigating the explosion of the Tesla vehicle ""including whether there's any possible connection with the attack in New Orleans,"" Biden told reporters, adding: ""Thus far, there's nothing to report on that score.""Before authorities confirmed the driver’s identity as an American citizen and Army veteran, initial reports speculated that the vehicle might have crossed the border from Mexico. US President-elect Donald Trump commented on social media, suggesting that his condemnations of immigrants in the country without legal permission had been validated.""When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,"" Trump said on his website, Truth Social.The attack began around 3:15 am (local time) on Wednesday when the suspect drove a truck around a police car blocking Bourbon Street and struck multiple people along the street before crashing. He then opened fire, according to officials, and was killed in a shootout with police. Two police officers were among those injured in the attack.""This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could,"" New Orleans Police superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said during a news conference. ""He was hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.""Guns and pipe bombs were found in the suspect's vehicle, according to the State Police bulletin. The devices were concealed within coolers and wired for remote detonation with a remote control that also was found in the vehicle, the bulletin said.The FBI is investigating the incdient as a terrorist attack and believes the driver did not act alone. Guns, an improvised explosive device (IED), and other suspicious devices were found in the vehicle and elsewhere in the French Quarter.The suspect has been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a US Army veteran who was honourably discharged.Biden confirmed that the driver, identified as Jabbar from Houston, was a former US Army member who also served in the Army Reserves. He said that the investigation is ongoing and cautioned against making assumptions. ""The law enforcement and intelligence community continue to look for any connections, associations, or coconspirators. We have nothing in addition to report at this time,"" Biden said.According to the Pentagon, Jabbar served over 10 years in the military as a human resources specialist and IT specialist and was deployed to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010.Jabbar held a degree in computing from Georgia State University and lived in Houston, Texas, where he had worked as a real estate agent.The FBI said that it believes Jabbar may have had accomplices but has provided limited additional details at this stage of the investigation.“We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible. We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates,” FBI assistant special agent in charge Alethea Duncan told reporters, adding that investigators were looking into a ""range of suspects.""The attack occurred in the French Quarter, a historic district in New Orleans known for its lively nightlife, including numerous bars, restaurants, and jazz venues.The French Quarter is famous for hosting Mardi Gras, a pre-Lenten street celebration.

Biden condemn incident, Trump blame ‘illegal immigration’

New footage has surfaced showing the moments leading up to a terror attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans that claimed 15 lives and left multiple others injured on New Year. The attacker, identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar , allegedly navigated around a police cruiser barricade before driving a truck into a crowd of revelers.The footage, shared on X, shows that several vehicles had crossed the barricade amidst congested streets, a result of the festivities.Witnesses allege that the barricades in place were inadequate. “We have these hydraulic steel barriers from past events. Those barricades were not up, period. They had the flimsy orange ones that you could just push over with your finger,” a witness told CNN.Local reports also indicate that the city was in the process of replacing the bollards on Bourbon Street.Jabbar’s attack unfolded in the heart of the French Quarter, where he drove a truck into a densely packed crowd before being fatally shot during a gunfight with police. The aftermath revealed a scene of carnage, as Bourbon Street had been bustling with celebrants ushering in the year 2025.According to police commissioner Anne Kirkpatrick, the suspect was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did” and made deliberate attempts “to run over as many people as he could.”The FBI’s special agent in charge, Alethea Duncan, disclosed that evidence recovered from Jabbar’s vehicle—including weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and an ISIS flag—has led investigators to suspect a network of accomplices. “This was not an isolated act,” Duncan said.Condemnations poured in from across the political spectrum. US President Joe Biden said, “There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities.”Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump linked the incident to illegal immigration, claiming, “They’re worse than the criminals we have in our country"" before it was revealed that he was a US citizen.","Shamsud Din Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd of revelers in New Orleans on New Year's Eve, killing 15 and injuring multiple others.

More than 300 arrests in Berlin

Major warehouse fire in Neuwied, timber ablaze

Pyrotechnics association says illegal fireworks are the problem

Germany's raucous New Year's celebrations led to a typically busy night for emergency services overnight and into the early hours of Wednesday.Police and fire services around the country reported at least four fatal injuries the following morning, seemingly connected to explosions.In several cities, emergency services were pelted by pyrotechnics — a recurring trend in recent years. One Berlin officer was severely hurt and required surgery.The capital's university hospital said it was treating eight people with severe hand injuries and ""the night is still young"" soon after midnight. It later updated the figure to 15.Berlin police issued an update in the early hours of Wednesday, praising the implementation of new no-fireworks zones in the city centre — but still reporting widespread issues outside those areas.""We have had to carry out around 320 arrests, in several cases both rescue workers and police came under fire [from pyrotechnics],"" Berlin police spokesman Florian Nath said in a video posted online. Berlin police were escorting fire crews in the city for their own safety, a move police said had helped.""We also have a severely injured police officer who appears to have been hit by an illegal firework,"" Nath said, adding he underwent emergency surgery overnight.Cologne's police said that two officers were injured by illegal fireworks and that fireworks had been shot at officers and firefighters. A group of around 50 people in Leipzig attacked emergency services. Similar reports and images emerged from parts of Hamburg and elsewhere.Fire crews were in action all over the country dealing with smaller fires — garbage cans, houses, cars, garages and other items found near the pavements.In Neuwied, a small city in western Germany, though, police suspected a firework caused one blaze at a warehouse that grew to a serious size before being reported shortly before 1 a.m.""At the site a large warehouse, storing timber among other things, was discovered fully ablaze,"" Neuwied/Rhein police said in a statement. Affected locals were cleared from nearby homes by emergency services and the fire was brought under control, it said.""Work to extinguish the fire continues,"" police said in an update at around 6 a.m. ""The severe heat build-up also caused damage to nearby buildings."" They estimated costs to be in ""a medium six-figure range.""""The cause for this fire is most likely also a New Year's firework. Investigations into this continue,"" police said, a matter of hours after having responded to a similar blaze in the town centre.Police, medical professionals and firefighters have more than once recommended a firework ban, or at least some restrictions on the mass New Year's Eve fireworks amnesty practised in Germany, in recent years. The practice was shut down for two years amid COVID-19, albeit then to limit public gatherings.The German Pyrotechnics Association, meanwhile, said that the deaths and serious injuries could be traced back to illegal firework usage.""These extremely dangerous DIY jobs have nothing to do with legal and checked New Year's fireworks"" from approved handlers, board member Ingo Schubert said.He argued that serious injury was ""all but ruled out"" even in cases of improper usage of approved fireworks and said the onus should be on authorities to crack down on illegal pyrotechnics, not those sold in shops.","Police and fire services report at least four fatal injuries the following morning, seemingly connected to explosions.

New Orleans faces the aftermath

New Year’s revelers in New Orleans were left in shock and horror after a truck plowed into the crowd on Bourbon Street, leaving twisted and horribly disfigured bodies scattered across the sidewalk. Eyewitness accounts describe a nightmare that unfolded in the blink of an eye, as a terrorist attack turned the bustling street into a scene of chaos, destruction, and unimaginable loss.Jimmy Cothran, who was among those seeking refuge in a nightclub, recounted the shocking aftermath. ""Dead right in front of us was someone’s mother, twisted, obviously deceased,"" he told NBC News. He continued, his voice trembling, ""One man, deceased, had tire tracks across his back and when someone turned him over, he had tire tracks across his stomach and was clearly crushed.""But the most heart-wrenching moment came when Cothran described the lifeless body of a little girl, “a little girl that we had seen dancing as we were walking up the street.” ""She was as flat as a pillow,"" he said, his words trailing off as he recalled the sheer horror of what unfolded before his eyes. ""It just kept going. Every eye shot — body, body, body, body. It was unbelievable,"" reported the Post.Another eyewitness, who identified himself only as Paul S., gave a chilling account of the scene. He was in his hotel room when he first heard what sounded like gunfire, followed by the deafening roar of an explosion that sounded like fireworks. He soon stepped out onto the balcony, where the view of Bourbon Street was horrifying. ""We heard a ‘pop, pop, pop, pop’ sound, followed by a sound that sounded like fireworks going off, like a big firework all at once, and it turned out that was the crash,"" he told ABC.What he saw when he looked down at Bourbon Street was a scene straight out of a horror movie. ""There’s litter all over the sidewalks, and then there were bodies laid up next to garbage cans and people rushing to give aid,” Paul S. recalled. The street, once bustling with partygoers, was now eerily silent except for the people frantically trying to help the victims.For 18-year-old Parsons, who was celebrating with friends, the terror began with the screech of tires. ""Real-life horror movie,"" he said, describing the scene as the truck barreled through the crowd. ""Everything the car is hitting, it’s getting thrown. It’s getting thrown up into the air and away and just under the car.” He and his friends ducked for cover in a space between two bars, but when he emerged, the sight was gut-wrenching.""One of my friends, a woman, was lying in the street, badly injured but alive,"" Parsons said, voice shaking. ""But farther down, there were bodies littered throughout the entire street.” The chaos left emergency crews scrambling, and Parsons, not knowing what had happened to his injured friend, feared the worst. ""I don’t know where they took her. I don’t know her condition,"" he said, unable to shake the image of her lying there, helpless.Authorities reported that the suspect drove the truck through a busy intersection at the south end of Bourbon Street, an area packed with nightclubs and revelers. The attack was particularly devastating as the steel barriers, which would normally have been in place to prevent such incidents, had been removed a few weeks earlier for the upcoming Super Bowl. The city was in the process of replacing them, but their absence proved catastrophic.Bob Simms, who previously oversaw security for the French Quarter, said the old barriers might not have been enough to stop the truck even if they had been in place. ""They were very ineffective. The track was always full of crap; beads and doubloons and God knows what else,"" he said. ""Not the best idea.""As New Orleans grapples with the aftermath of the brutal attack, the scale of the tragedy is becoming clearer with each passing hour. Families are left devastated, survivors traumatized, and the city must now pick up the pieces of what was supposed to be a night of celebration turned into a nightmare.","Eyewitnesses describe horror of New Orleans terror attack.

In another instance, he reportedly gifted the late Queen Elizabeth II a cheeky shower cap emblazoned with the phrase “Ain’t life a b---h.” Kate herself joined the tradition, reportedly presenting Harry with a playful ""grow-your-own-girlfriend"" kit during one festive season.This year, William and Kate, along with their three children—Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6—continued the royal custom of spending Christmas at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.

Reports indicate that Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, did not join the festivities at Sandringham.

'We were told there was a man under the subway'



Kamel Hawkins , a 23-year-old man, was charged with attempted murder after he was seen shoving a complete stranger onto the tracks at the 18th Street station moments before the subway train came. The chilling video of the incident went viral with social media users commenting on how the NYC subway has become a haven for maniacs -- with back-to-back incidents of stabbing, and setting on fire taking place.After pushing a random stranger onto the train track, Hawkins fled the station and was arrested hours later above ground near Columbus Circle.Hawkins has a record of weird behaviors and past crimes including one where he assaulted a cop. In 2019, Hawkins was charged after slamming a cop to the ground on Flushing Avenue when the officer spotted him acting disorderly, leaving the cop with a back injury.Hawkins also has an open case in Brooklyn on assault, harassment and weapons possession charges for an incident.

President Biden: ‘We will get to the truth’

City on high alert

Investigators are now convinced that Shamsud Din Jabbar , the man behind the horrific New Year’s Eve attack in the French Quarter, was not acting alone. Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 people before he was fatally shot in a gunfight with police.Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan of the FBI revealed that evidence found in Jabbar’s vehicle, including weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and an ISIS flag , points to a possible network of accomplices. “We do not believe the suspect was solely responsible,” Duncan stated. “We are aggressively pursuing leads about his associates and potential connections to terrorist organizations .”Authorities believe Jabbar’s attack may have been coordinated with others. “Weapons and IEDs discovered in his vehicle suggest this was not a spur-of-the-moment act,” Duncan explained. She also noted that investigators are working to determine how Jabbar acquired the materials and who may have aided him.The FBI is asking the public for help in identifying any associates or suspicious activity linked to Jabbar. “Every piece of information could make a difference,” Duncan said.In the aftermath of the attack, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry declared a State of Emergency to bolster the investigation and protect public safety. “This declaration allows us to bring every resource to bear in dismantling any threats beyond Jabbar,” Landry announced. The mobilization of the Louisiana National Guard and military police units underscores the severity of the situation.President Joe Biden condemned the attack and affirmed the federal government’s commitment to uncovering the full scope of the incident. “The FBI is leading this investigation as an act of terrorism,” Biden said in a statement. “We will not rest until we understand who else was involved and ensure the safety of every American.”Biden also praised the swift action of local law enforcement and extended condolences to the victims and their families, calling the attack “an unspeakable act of violence.”As New Orleans mourns the loss of life, authorities are intensifying efforts to prevent further attacks. Duncan emphasized the importance of public cooperation, stating, “If you know something, say something. This investigation is far from over.”","Shamsud Din Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 people before he was fatally shot in a gunfight with police.

involved an EV pickup truck and left 10 dead, with an ISIS flag found in the vehicle. Authorities are investigating a potential link between the two incidents but have not confirmed a connection.

Ongoing Investigation

Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are working to unravel whether the similarities between the two incidents point to a broader, coordinated threat. For now, the nation watches as investigators dig deeper into the devastating events of Wednesday.

Authorities are investigating a chilling possibility: two violent incidents on the same day, both involving vehicles rented from the car-sharing platform Turo , may be connected.In Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck rented through Turo erupted into flames outside the Trump International Hotel Wednesday morning. The explosion, which left one person dead and seven others injured, is being treated as a possible act of terrorism. A video circulating online shows the Cybertruck engulfed in fire just seconds after stopping near the hotel’s entrance.“We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a statement.Elon Musk, who also holds a government role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), described the incident as ""unprecedented"" and promised an in-depth investigation.Hours earlier in New Orleans, a suspect identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar drove a Turo-rented EV pickup truck into a crowd of New Year revelers on Bourbon Road, killing 10 people and injuring dozens. Police later found an ISIS flag in the vehicle, sparking fears of a terror link.The FBI has confirmed they are probing whether Jabbar had ties to ISIS or acted alone. “It is still unclear how the suspect obtained the truck,” an FBI spokesperson said, adding that investigations are ongoing.Las Vegas police are examining whether the same rental service used in both cases points to a coordinated plot. However, no concrete link between the two incidents has been established yet.Speaking to reporters, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill called the connection “an avenue we are aggressively pursuing.”Turo is a car rental marketplace that allows users to rent cars from ""trusted hosts"" across the United States, Canada, Australia, and France. According to the app’s description on Google Play, it is the ""world's largest car-sharing marketplace,"" offering users an alternative to traditional rental car services.The app touts itself as a way to ""skip the rental car counter"" and choose from an ""extraordinary selection of vehicles shared by local hosts."" It also positions itself as an entrepreneurial opportunity, stating, “Entrepreneurs can take the wheel of their futures by becoming hosts and building car-sharing businesses on Turo.”Galit Ventura Rozen, who was staying in a nearby hotel, described the scene as terrifying. “I looked out the window and saw a huge cloud of smoke rising from the Trump Hotel,” she said. “We didn’t know what was happening, but it felt like something big.”President Joe Biden condemned the violence, saying, “There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities.” He promised updates as investigations continue.Law enforcement agencies in Nevada and Louisiana are investigating whether the two incidents are connected or coincidental. “We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck,” read a statement from Las Vegas authorities.","Both vehicles involved in the incidents were rented through Turo.

A Tesla Cybertruck explosion and fire outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday are being investigated as a possible act of terrorism , according to law enforcement officials. The incident has raised significant concerns due to its timing and proximity to another attack in New Orleans.The fire was reported at 8:40 am local time. When emergency crews arrived, the 2024 Cybertruck was fully engulfed in flames. Authorities confirmed that one individual inside the vehicle was killed, although their identity remains unknown. Seven others sustained minor injuries from the explosion, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a news conference.Video shared online shows the vehicle consumed by smoke as firefighters battled the flames. Surveillance footage reveals the truck passing the Trump Hotel an hour before the explosion, circling back, and stopping in front of the hotel before detonating seconds later.Officials disclosed that the truck contained fireworks, gas tanks, and camping fuel. These items were reportedly connected to a detonation system believed to have been controlled by the driver. The vehicle was rented through the car-sharing platform Turo.Authorities are investigating potential links to an earlier attack in New Orleans, where a rented truck was used to ram into a crowd, killing 10 people and injuring dozens. However, no direct connection has been established between the two incidents.Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge of the FBI in Las Vegas, confirmed his team is involved in the investigation, saying, “We are treating this as a possible act of terrorism until more evidence is gathered.”Sheriff McMahill acknowledged the heightened concerns due to the location and nature of the incident. “A Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel—there’s lots of questions we have to answer as we move forward,” he said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the incident on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “We have confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.”Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, expressed gratitude to first responders and emphasized the safety of hotel guests and staff, calling it “our top priority.”Galit Ventura Rozen, a guest at a nearby hotel, described the scene as chaotic. “We saw a huge cloud of smoke … and a line of at least three ambulances and a bunch of police cars,” she said. Guests from the Trump Hotel were later seen gathered in a nearby parking lot.Law enforcement is actively searching for any secondary devices and remains vigilant about potential threats to the community. Sheriff McMahill assured the public that there is no immediate danger but said the investigation is far from over.","A Tesla Cybertruck explosion and fire outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday are being investigated as a possible act of terrorism.

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

Balochistan: 13-year-old among two missing after detention by Pakistani forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/balochistan-13-year-old-among-two-missing-after-detention-by-pakistani-forces/articleshow/116738688.cms,"Two people have reportedly gone missing after being allegedly detained by Pakistan's armed forces in Balochistan , with one case involving a 13-year-old boy. The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","The boy, identified as Balach, is from the Panjgur district of Balochistan.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani minister on Wednesday defended the military trial of civilians, saying that such courts were competent to deal with the cases related to attacks on army facilities.Information minister Attaullah Tarar also urged the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan to refrain from politicising or disputing the issue of military trials.""When an attack is carried out on a defence institution or its property is set ablaze, it becomes the responsibility of the relevant authorities to apprehend the culprits. Just as railway police handle crimes on railway premises, military courts address offences targeting military assets. So, when attacks on military assets occur, the Military Act is enforced,"" he said while addressing a press conference.Tarar criticised Khan's party for using military courts as a political tool, aiming to create controversy around them. He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.
