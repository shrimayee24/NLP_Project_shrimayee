From Nehru's kinship to Modi's firepower: India shifts tone on Pak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-nehrus-kinship-to-modis-firepower-india-shifts-tone-on-pak/articleshow/123351495.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""Our neighbour is Pakistan, which is a part of us, part of our hearts and arms. How do we even think of fighting them? This is like harming ourselves. And, if they are aggressive, they will harm themselves. This is a strange relationship between India and Pakistan. Strange relationship where there is sorrow and anger but ultimately that relationship is so close and for thousands of years that laws can't eradicate it. And, if something harms India, it will definitely harm Pakistan as well,"" Jawaharlal Nehru told the nation from the Red Fort in 1957 on Independence Day.Nearly seven decades later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday struck a markedly different note.Signalling no rethink on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) under present circumstances, he declared that India will not distinguish between terrorists and their sponsors, pointing directly at Pakistan's leadership.Prime Minister Modi underlined that the country would not succumb to ""any sort of nuclear blackmail.""""The Indus Waters Treaty was an injustice to the people of India. The rivers of India were irrigating the enemy country while our own farmers were deprived of water.Now, the right over India's share of water belongs only to India and its farmers. A compromise on farmers' interests and national interests is not acceptable to us. Not anymore,"" he said. Modi added, ""India will no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail. If the enemy dares to commit any more misadventure, the armed forces will give them a befitting reply. India has decided that blood and water will not flow together.""Recalling last month's strikes, Modi said, ""Operation Sindoor was the expression of that outrage... Penetrating hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory, they reduced terrorist headquarters to dust... Pakistan is still sleepless.""This stark contrast captures the transformation in India's attitude towards Pakistan. PM Modi's language of deterrence and retaliation has replaced the earlier vocabulary of kinship and restraint. From invoking Balochistan, Gilgit and PoK in his 2016 speech to citing deep-penetration strikes in 2025, his addresses reflect a conscious break from decades of what he has called misplaced sentimentality.By comparison, the Nehruvian era was shaped by reconciliation despite provocations. Nehru's framing of Pakistan as inseparable from India's ""heart and arms"" translated into policies like the IWT and territorial concessions under the Noon-Nehru Pact. Even in the face of aggression, he sought to preserve ties.Indira Gandhi's decisive 1971 victory did not fundamentally alter that mindset. Returning 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war, according to experts, without securing a settlement on Kashmir reflected a continued view of Pakistan as a ""brother"". Rajiv Gandhi's Independence Day speeches largely bypassed Pakistan, centring instead on domestic modernisation.Even after terror struck deep, restraint prevailed. In 2009, less than a year after the 26/11 attacks, Manmohan Singh's address spoke only of honouring ""special assurances and concessions provided to J&K"" - a line that avoided naming Pakistan directly. From Nehru's fraternity to Modi's firepower, the arc of Independence Day speeches reveals how India's strategic outlook on Pakistan - and China - has hardened from conciliatory sentiment to hard-nosed realism.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday struck a markedly different note.

KURUKSHETRA: Congress member of parliament Deepender Singh Hooda launched an attack on the Haryana government on Sunday, alleging a complete breakdown of law and order in the state. Participating in several social programmes in Kurukshetra district, Hooda said the ruling dispensation has lost all control over governance, while criminals continue to operate fearlessly.“The law-and-order situation in Haryana has collapsed, and this government has completely failed,” Hooda asserted. “Even the officers in administration no longer take the chief minister seriously because they know the real control lies elsewhere. While the chief minister talks about crushing criminals, the reality is that criminals have crushed the law-and-order machinery instead. The state today needs a strong government, not a helpless one. ”The Congress leader alleged that police stations have become hostile for victims, who are turned away instead of being helped. He claimed that the government has virtually surrendered before criminals, allowing Haryana to become a safe haven for organized crime.Citing a February meeting of directors general of police (DGPs) from seven states, Hooda revealed that the special task force (STF) had disclosed the presence of more than 80 active organised crime syndicates in Haryana.“Several gangs have international links, and many operate freely from local jails,” he said. “These groups are engaged in contract killings, drug trafficking, illegal arms trade, kidnappings, extortion, and online frauds. The fact that gangs continue to function even from within prisons proves that they enjoy the protection of those in power. This is not just a challenge to Haryana’s law and order, but also a serious threat to internal national security.”Hooda drew a contrast with the earlier Congress government led by former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, saying, “When the Congress assumed power in 2005, within just two months, the law-and-order situation was brought under control. The people of Haryana once again need such a decisive and strong government.”On the issue of alleged electoral malpractice, Hooda echoed the concerns raised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. He claimed that the BJP has manipulated democratic institutions to retain power. “The BJP’s only objective is to cling to power by using every possible means—fair or foul. The Election Commission has failed to remain impartial, raising serious questions about its credibility and the very faith of the people in democracy. Vote theft has also occurred in Haryana, and the truth will soon be revealed,” he said.Several prominent Congress leaders, including Shahabad MLA Ramkaran Kala and Pehowa MLA Mandeep Singh Chatha, former MLA Mewa Singh, former MP Kailasho Saini, and party functionary Himanshu Arora, were also present at the events.","Congress member of parliament Deepender Singh Hooda launched an attack on the Haryana government on Sunday, alleging a complete breakdown of law and order in the state.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.","Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

Ex-congressman Anthony Weiner on Sunday predicted that top Democratic leaders will eventually have no choice but to endorse socialist Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor elections.Speaking in a radio program, Weiner said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will ultimately back Mamdani as the party’s nominee.“Some people can stay on the sidelines, and I think you’re going to see a lot of people do that. but the leaders of the party, which Chuck and Hakeem are, are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,” he said. “They’ve got the Democratic Party, who’s now chosen their nominee.”Weiner said top Democrats such as Schumer and Jeffries have delayed endorsing Mamdani to avoid hurting moderate party members in the 2026 midterm elections.The reason Chuck and Hakeem have been so slow to endorse Zohran is because they don’t want to harm their moderate candidates all around the country, which are the ones they need to take back the House and Senate,” he said. “That’s a political question for them.”Republicans are using Zohran Mamdani’s candidacy to attack Democrats, hoping to paint the entire party as too far left. At the same tine, Weiner has also predicted that Mamdani is likely to win the mayoral race as the Democratic nominee, as reported by New York Post.“Unfortunately, or fortunately … I think we’re going to have Zohran Mamdani as the mayor in New York City,” he said.Two other Democrats, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, are also running as independents in the upcoming November elections. However, Weiner had dismissed their chances of defeating Mamdani.Weiner whose career collapsed amid sex scandals, recently attempted a political comeback by running for a City Council seat in Manhattan’s District 2. He was soundly defeated by Assemblyman Harvey Epstein.Weiner’s political downfall began in 2011 when he resigned from Congress after admitting to sending explicit photos to several women.

Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin’s 23XI Racing beats NASCAR’s motion in court

Front Row Motorsports and 23XI Racing push antitrust case as December trial nears

Michael Jordan’s NASCAR team, 23XI Racing, co-owned with driver Denny Hamlin, scored a key courtroom win in North Carolina. A federal judge said NASCAR’s demand that the racing teams show cause, to explain why they shouldn’t face penalties over “manufactured evidence” claims, was denied. The judge ruled the motion didn’t help the case and seemed more aimed at affecting public opinion than the court’s process. This is a big moment in a long fight over whether NASCAR holds too much control in the sport.Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin own 23XI Racing. Their partner in this fight, Front Row Motorsports, is owned by Bob Jenkins.NASCAR filed a motion on August 7, 2025, asking the court to order the teams and their lawyers to explain why they shouldn’t be punished for supposedly submitting “manufactured evidence” in their fight against NASCAR.On August 11, the judge rejected NASCAR’s request, saying it did not move the lawsuit forward and appeared to seek a narrative rather than justice.Also Read: “Body Language Of Beaten Man”: Martina Navratilova Calls Out Donald Trump Following Failed Peace Talks With Vladimir Putin In October 2024, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports brought antitrust action alleging that NASCAR's control of charters, racetracks, and suppliers gives it an inequitable monopoly in stock-car racing.Judge Kenneth Bell issued the teams a preliminary injunction in December 2024 so they might compete as registered teams while the case goes forward.That meant 23XI and FRM could race with guaranteed spots and money.In June 2025, an appellate court overturned that decision. The teams lost their charter status and were ordered to race as “open entries”, meaning they might miss races and lose revenue.Then, on July 16, 2025, NASCAR accused 23XI and FRM of faking evidence and lying in court filings. The pressure only got thicker, with a judge even urging both sides to consider a settlement in June 2025.Denny Hamlin, speaking in Dover, Delaware, said the teams will keep racing as open entries and vowed that “all will be exposed” when their trial starts on December 1, 2025.","Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin own 23XI Racing.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s bodyguards reportedly carried a special “poop suitcase” to collect his faecal waste during his summit with US President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, according to reports.The unusual security measure is said to be aimed at preventing foreign powers from obtaining sensitive information about Putin’s health. “Putin's bodyguards collect his faecal waste and bring it back to Russia when the leader travels abroad,” The Express reported, citing investigative journalists Regis Gente and Mikhail Rubin.The journalists claimed that members of the Russian President's Federal Protection Service (FPS) store his waste in special bags and transport it in dedicated briefcases.According to The Express, this practice dates back several years, including Putin’s 2017 visit to France. Former BBC journalist Farida Rustamova also reported that similar precautions were in place during his trip to Vienna, when the Russian leader used a portable toilet.Rustamova said a source confirmed that the practice has been in place since Putin assumed leadership in 1999.Reports about the 72-year-old president’s health have long fuelled speculation.During a press conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, in November last year, Putin was seen jerking his legs, raising concerns.Dr Bob Berookhim suggested it could be linked to a condition like Parkinson’s disease, as per The Express US.Putin was also observed twitching while meeting Belarusian President Alexandr Lukashenko in 2023.Additional claims cited by The Express suggested Putin may have suffered a cardiac arrest in the past, requiring intensive care at his official residence.The “poop suitcase” reports surfaced as Putin met Trump in Alaska for peace talks over the Ukraine conflict.",Russian President Vladimir Putin met US President Donald Trump in Alaska.

No more German visas for Kremlin critics fleeing Russia?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/no-more-german-visas-for-kremlin-critics-fleeing-russia/articleshow/123355468.cms,".





Some 300 Russians and Belarussians may be prevented from obtaining visas for Germany after Berlin suspended its humanitarian visa programs at the end of July, according to the Ark project (Kovcheg).Founded in March 2022, The Ark supports Russians fleeing persecution by the Russian authorities, in particular opponents of Russia's war against Ukraine.In all these cases, visas had already been approved by the German Foreign Office — but the Ministry of the Interior has stopped them from being issued.Sent to an orphanage for an anti-war drawingOne of those affected is Alexei Moskalev, a Russian man who was persecuted in his homeland because of a drawing his young daughter did in school. The drawing showed Russia firing rockets at Ukraine, with a mother standing in front of a child, holding up a hand to ward them off.Masha Moskaleva from the Russian region of Tula was 13 years old when she did the drawing in an art class in the spring of 2022, not long after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The drawing was seized on by the international media after the Russian authorities took an interest in it.According to the girl's father, Alexei Moskalev, the school administration reported the drawing to the police, and Masha was interviewed by members of Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB.In 2023, Moskalev was sentenced to two years in prison. The court found him guilty of discrediting the army in anti-war comments he was said to have made on a Russian social network, Odnoklassniki. State authorities sent his daughter Masha to an orphanage before later handing her over to her mother, who had been estranged from the family for several years.Moskalev left Russia after his release from prison in October 2024, as he was in danger of being arrested again. ""When I was in prison, in Vladimir Putin's dungeons, FSB officers came to see me twice,"" he says. ""They always stressed, at the end of our conversation, 'We're not going to leave you alone, even after you're released.'""Many former Soviet countries not safeAnton K. (name changed for security reasons) left Russia at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Back home, the former activist and journalist worked with publications branded ""foreign agents"" by the authorities. Today, he works for an online medium whose editor-in-chief is in custody, accused of inciting terrorism.Anton K. also took part in anti-Kremlin protests, and was arrested many times in consequence. Russia's ""Center for Combating Extremism"" took his fingerprints so that, if necessary, it could find him more easily.Like Alexei Moskalev, Anton K. is also currently in one of the CIS states. The Commonwealth of Independent States is an organization of Soviet Union successor states, and in addition to Russia it consists of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.Lawyer Anastasia Burakova is the founder of Kovcheg, the Ark Project that supports Russian dissidents abroad. She told DW that it was dangerous for opponents of the regime to stay in these countries long-term. ""There's always the risk of an extradition request from Russia if a person is wanted in a politically motivated case,"" Burakova says.""There are abduction attempts, like those we've seen in Armenia, but there are also successful abductions, as in Kyrgyzstan; those people ended up in Russian prisons.""Humanitarian visa can save people from persecutionAnton K. and Alexei Moskalev were very aware of these risks, so they applied for humanitarian visas for Germany, along with some 300 other Russians and Belarusians. German authorities can issue this visa to independent journalists, activists, and politicians who are persecuted in their home countries.According to The Ark, around 2,600 people from Russia have been granted these visas for Germany in the past three-and-a-half years of the war. ""More than 2,600 people have been given the chance to come to a safe place, to evade a Russian prison sentence, torture, and persecution for their civil society activism and their opposition to the war,"" Anastasia Burakova stresses.Visas not issued, despite approvalAt the end of July this year, Germany's Ministry of the Interior announced that it was suspending the humanitarian visa program. The reason given was the coalition contract between the governing parties, the CDU/CSU and the SPD, which refers to a toughening of migration policy.Anton K.'s visa was almost in the bag. At the beginning of July, he was invited to present his passport at the German embassy in order to receive the visa. However, at this point the procedure was broken off. Anton's passport is still at the embassy.Alexei Moskalev had a similar experience. He says the German Foreign Office had already approved his visa, but because of the new government's decision, he hasn't received it. It has been more than six months since he submitted the required documents.Interior ministry cites ongoing review of proceduresThe German Ministry of the Interior told DW that the governing parties' coalition agreement included the intention to ""terminate voluntary federal admission programs as far as possible,"" and said they were currently examining how this could be implemented with regard to the various programs.""We cannot preempt the outcome of this review,"" it stated. ""Until a decision is made, procedures for the admission of persons in order to safeguard the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany under Section 22, Paragraph 2 of the Residence Act are also generally suspended, meaning that, in principle, new admissions will not be declared nor visas issued, except in urgent cases."" The ministry added that exceptions could be made ""in particularly special individual cases. ""Anastasia Burakova hopes that this wording means that it will indeed make exceptions. It will become clear in practice what exactly the German authorities regard as ""urgent cases,"" she says.In August of this year, there were 1,043 people categorized by the Russian human rights organization Memorial as political prisoners in Russia. According to the independent Russian news portal The Bell, which operates outside the country, around 700,000 people have left Russia since the start of its all-out war against Ukraine.","Some 300 Russians and Belarussians may be prevented from obtaining visas for Germany.

A shocking crash caught on video has left three people dead after a minivan ploughed into a tractor-trailer making a reckless U-turn on the Florida Turnpike last week, authorities said. The truck driver — identified as Harjinder Singh, an illegal migrant — has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide.The fatal collision unfolded around 3 pm Tuesday near Fort Pierce, when Singh allegedly attempted to cut across the highway through an “official use only” median pass. His truck’s massive trailer blocked all lanes of oncoming traffic, leaving drivers with no room to stop or swerve.Footage from inside the cab showed a black minivan speeding toward the trailer, with only seconds to impact. The van smashed into the trailer at full force, wedging underneath in a devastating collision that reduced the vehicle to mangled metal.Photos from the scene showed the van torn apart, its roof peeled back, and its contents scattered across the highway. Emergency crews used hydraulic jacks to lift the trailer and recover the victims, while Singh was seen standing nearby with a blank expression.Two passengers in the minivan died instantly, while the driver was pulled alive from the wreck but succumbed to injuries at a local hospital.Authorities identified the victims as a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach, a 30-year-old man from Florida City, and a 54-year-old man from Miami, Treasure Coast Newspapers reported.Investigators said Singh, who carried a California commercial driver’s license, has been in the US illegally since crossing the Mexican border in 2018. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued a detainer against him, according to CBS 12. If convicted of homicide, he faces prison time in Florida before deportation.“Three people lost their lives as a result of his recklessness, and countless friends and family members will experience the pain of their loss forever,” said Dave Kerner to CBS 12, executive director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.Singh remains in custody on state and federal charges.","Harjinder Singh, an illegal migrant, has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide.

During Saturday night, many Ukrainians stayed up and anxiously waited for news from the Alaska summit between US President Donald Trump and Russia's head of state Vladimir Putin. For some, there was hope the talks could lead to some sort of end of Russia's war against Ukraine.Many Ukrainians though feared the price for this might be territorial concessions Kyiv would be pressured into making. But it soon became clear that the summit in Alaska had brought no fundamental changes.No deal, just a photo op""There were no concrete results for Ukraine,"" Oleksandr Kraiev of the Ukrainian Prism think tank told DW.""Thank God nothing was signed and no radical decisions were made,"" the North America expert said. ""The summit was an extremely successful information operation for Russia. The war criminal Putin came to the US and shook hands with the leader of the free world.""According to Kraiev, apart from ""Trump's deference toward Putin, there were no final answers to the most important questions."" He believes that Putin dealt with Trump ""with surgical precision"" and told him everything Trump wanted to hear.This way, Putin got everything he wanted out of the summit.According to Ivan Us from Ukraine's Center for Foreign Policy of the National Institute for Strategic Studies, the Russian president never wanted the summit to lead to an end to the war. Instead, Putin's goal was to legitimize himself and end his international isolation.""For Putin, having a joint photo with Trump was the goal of this summit. To show in Russia that the isolation is over, that there won't be new sanctions, and that everything is fine, so that there'd be positive impulses for the markets. And for Trump, it was a moment where he wanted to demonstrate strength. He was walking next to Putin while a US bomber flew above them, the same bomber that recently attacked Iran. This was a signal to everyone not to forget who the most important country in the world is,"" Us told DW.As if to confirm this, Dmitry Medvedev, chairman of Russia's Security Council, said after the Alaska summit that a ""full-fledged mechanism for meetings"" between Russia and the US at the highest level had been restored.""Important: The meeting proved that negotiations without preconditions and simultaneously with the continuation of the Special Military Operation are possible. Both sides directly put the responsibility for future negotiation results on Kyiv and Europe,"" Medvedev wrote on social networks. The term Special Military Operation is how Russia refers to its war against Ukraine.More uncertainty following Alaska summitIvan Us thinks that the summit did not get Ukraine closer to peace. Instead, it intensified the chaos, as the US and Russia are making contradictory statements about continuing possible trilateral dialogue involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. For example, Moscow says that Trump and Putin did not discuss a trilateral summit with Zelensky, while Washington says the opposite.Zelenskyy himself spoke of receiving an invitation to a trilateral meeting.""We support President Trump's proposal for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the US, and Russia. Ukraine emphasizes: Important issues can be discussed at the level of heads of state, and a trilateral format is suitable for this,"" he wrote on social media after a phone call with Donald Trump.Zelenskyy shared that he would meet with Donald Trump in Washington on August 18.""Ukraine confirms once again that it is ready to work toward peace as productively as possible. President Trump informed me about his meeting with the Russian president and about the key points of the discussion. It is important that US power influences the development of the situation,"" the Ukrainian president said.Moscow doesn't change its goalsThere are fears in Ukraine that Zelenskyy's trip to Washington could result in new pressure from the US on Ukraine.""Any 'no' from the Ukrainian side could be portrayed as [a] lack of willingness to end the war. Trump essentially admitted that it's about an 'exchange of territories for security guarantees,' and he confirmed that agreement was reached on certain points and spoke of a 'chance for success,'"" Iryna Herashchenko, Ukrainian MP and co-chair of the opposition party ""European Solidarity,"" wrote on social media.She believes that such formulations allow Moscow to present this as legitimization of its demands.""Putin repeated during the brief briefing once again that the actual causes of the conflict must be eliminated. This means that Moscow will not change its goals - because the existence of an independent Ukraine is seen as the actual cause,"" warns Herashchenko.Ukrainian political scientist Vadym Denisenko, however, believes that Russia's idea of ""doing business with the US in exchange for Ukrainian territory"" didn't work. Putin managed to gain time, though.""At Alaska, they agreed to negotiate,"" Denisenko wrote on social media.Nevertheless, he argues that Putin ""lost what was most important: his maneuverability. He drastically restricted his scope for action and is actually rapidly falling into China's arms.""Denisenko believes that if no results regarding the end of the war are achieved within two months, the issue will become part of Chinese-American negotiations.""In other words: A new window for negotiations will open earliest at the end of the year, realistically only in spring 2026,"" he predicted.A red, ""bloody"" carpetJ udging by discussions among ordinary Ukrainians, what angers them most is the red carpet that was rolled out for Putin at the US military base in Anchorage. Countless angry comments on social media leave little doubt over how this was perceived in Ukraine.""History always remembers not only those who kill, but also those who bestow murderers with honors. This is a special kind of shame and complicity in crime, which is too often confused with diplomacy. Today, this gallery was expanded with a new picture, with a bloody carpet and a parade of honor guard for the architect of Bucha, Mariupol, Izium, thousands of torture chambers, mass shootings, and deportations,"" said Mustafa Nayyem, former parliament member and ex-head of the State Agency for Reconstruction and Infrastructure.","Ukrainian political scientist Vadym Denisenko believes that Russia's idea of ""doing business with the US in exchange for Ukrainian territory"" didn't work.

Protesters in Israel call for end to Gaza war and hostage deal





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned protesters who have been calling for an end to the war in Gaza at nationwide demonstrations on Sunday.""Those calling today for an end to the war without the defeat of Hamas not only harden Hamas' position and draw out the release of our hostages, but also ensure that the horrors of October 7 will reoccur,"" Netanyahu told a Cabinet meeting.October 7 was the day in 2023 when Hamas-led militants carried out the deadly attacks in southern Israel that triggered Israel's ongoing Gaza offensive.Demonstrators took to the streets across Israel on Sunday, with Tel Aviv a focus for protests calling for an end to the war in Gaza and a deal to release hostages still held by militants in the Palestinian enclave.Protesters in Tel Aviv blocked several roads in the city, including the highway connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while a huge Israeli flag covered with portraits of the remaining captives was unfurled in so-called Hostage Square.Protest organizers and the main campaign group representing the families of hostages also called a general strike that caused many businesses to close.Protesters say they fear further fighting could endanger the hostages still thought to be in Gaza.Police employed water cannon and made more than two dozen arrests for ""disruption of order"" during the protests.The demonstrations were condemned by some members of the Israeli goverment, with far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich saying public pressure to obtain a deal ""buries the hostages in tunnels and seeks to push the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.""The protests come after Israel's security cabinet approved plans to seize Gaza City as the Israeli military continues its more than 22-month offensive against the Palestinian militant group Hamas.The offensive was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which 251 people were taken hostage in addition to the some 1,200 killed.Forty-nine of the hostages remain in Gaza, 27 of whom are dead, according to the Israeli military.","Protesters in Tel Aviv blocked several roads in the city, including the highway connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

A new poll fornewspaper revealed that more than two-thirds of Germans expect one of the country's state premiers to come from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party by next year.The survey by the Insa opinion research institute found that 68% expect an AfD state premier within the next few months.Some 43% of respondents expect at least one state in Germany to have an AfD premier, while 25% believe the party will get to appoint the leader of several states.The AfD is keeping up the pressure on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU/CSU alliance, with weekly polls regularly putting the nationalist party in front nationally.The German states of Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will hold state elections next year.Nearly half of those polled (47%) said they support the country's far-right firewall, where all mainstream parties have ruled out working with the AfD. But 40% oppose the firewall.","More than two-thirds of Germans expect one of the country's state premiers to come from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Attack on senator Chris Murphy

Broadside against media







US President Donald Trump has lashed out at the media and Democrats, rejecting claims that he suffered a setback after hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Alaska summit on 15 August.In a series of posts on Truth Social late Sunday, Trump said: “The Fake News has been saying for 3 days that I suffered a ‘major defeat’ by allowing President Vladimir Putin of Russia to have a major Summit in the United States. Actually, he would have loved doing the meeting anywhere else but the US, and the Fake News knows this. It was a major point of contention! If we had the Summit elsewhere, the Democrat run and controlled media would have said what a terrible thing that was. These people are sick!”The president also defended his decision to host the high-profile meeting of European leaders coming with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for peace negotiations, saying it is an honour for America rather than a loss.“The Fake News will say that it is a big loss for President Trump to host so many great European Leaders at our beautiful White House. Actually, it is a great honour for America!!!” he wrote.Trump also took aim at senator Chris Murphy, who had earlier criticised the summit, saying Putin “got everything that he wanted.”Responding sharply, Trump wrote, “The very unattractive (both inside and out!) Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said ‘Putin got everything that he wanted.’Actually, ‘nobody got anything,’ too soon, but getting close. Murphy is a lightweight who thinks it made the Russian President look good in coming to America. Actually, it was very hard for President Putin to do so. This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so. ”Murphy had earlier described Trump’s move to federalise police in Washington, DC, as a “stunt” and suggested the president was under pressure from his own supporters over unrelated controversies, according to The Hill.Trump stressed that his focus remained on securing peace in Ukraine following the Alaska summit. “I had a great meeting in Alaska on Biden’s stupid War, a war that should have never happened!!!” he posted, adding that efforts were underway to reach a peace deal rather than just a ceasefire.The US president had earlier described the Alaska talks with Putin as a “great and very successful day” and said he also held late-night calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and European leaders, during which they agreed that a peace agreement, rather than a temporary ceasefire, would be the best way to end the conflict.Reiterating his long-standing criticism of the press, Trump accused journalists of deliberately misrepresenting his actions. “It’s incredible how the Fake News violently distorts the truth when it comes to me. There is nothing I can say or do that would lead them to write or report honestly about me,” he wrote.In another post, he argued that even if he secured a major concession from Moscow, the media would still attack him: “If I got Russia to give up Moscow as part of the Deal, the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left Democrats, would say I made a terrible mistake and a very bad deal. That’s why they are the Fake News!”The president also claimed credit for preventing further global conflicts, writing: “They should talk about the 6 wars, etc., I just stopped!!! MAGA.”The Alaska summit produced no immediate breakthrough, though Trump insisted progress had been made and that his strategy was aimed at moving towards a lasting peace.",US President Donald Trump has lashed out at the media and Democrats.

Russia demands its own guarantees

Trump balances talks between Kyiv and Moscow

Europe’s unease over security deal







Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed Washington’s decision to join security guarantees for Kyiv, describing it as a “historic step” and urging the creation of a trilateral format involving Ukraine, the United States and Russia.“Everyone supports that key issues must be resolved with Ukraine’s participation in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the US, and the Russian chief,” Zelenskyy said after talks with the Coalition of the Willing in Brussels on Sunday.Writing on X, he stressed that the guarantees must go beyond political gestures. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation.”Zelenskyy is due in Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Donald Trump. European leaders, including European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, will also attend.Ahead of that meeting, Zelenskyy underlined the importance of European unity and said, “It’s crucial that Europe remains as united as it was in 2022.This strong unity is essential to achieve a real peace.”Moscow, meanwhile, has pushed back against Western proposals. Russia’s Permanent Representative to International Organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said the West must also offer Russia reliable guarantees.“Many EU leaders emphasise that the future peace agreement should provide reliable security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia agrees with this. But it has every right to expect that Moscow will also receive effective security guarantees,” he said, warning against repeating what he called broken promises on Nato’s eastward expansion, as reported by Tass.According to news agency ANI, US President Trump has said that if his talks with Zelenskyy in Washington prove fruitful, he will then move to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, though he did not clarify if such a gathering would take the form of a trilateral summit.Trump had already met Putin in Alaska last week, but those talks failed to produce a ceasefire. Still, both leaders signalled agreement on the principle of “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine, according to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.The US president, who has shifted his rhetoric towards seeking a full peace deal rather than a temporary truce, wrote on Truth Social on Sunday: “Big progress on Russia. Stay tuned!”.European capitals have cautiously welcomed Washington’s stronger role. Ursula von der Leyen described the development as “positive,” but Zelenskyy rejected the idea of Moscow playing any part in shaping Kyiv’s security framework.“What President Trump said about security guarantees is much more important to me than Putin’s thoughts, because Putin will not give any security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference with von der Leyen in Brussels, as per AFP.Macron, for his part, made clear that Russia’s proposals amounted to capitulation. “There is only one state proposing a peace that would be a capitulation: Russia,” he said. Moscow’s foreign ministry later denounced this as an “abject lie.”Behind the scenes, sources cited by AFP claim that Washington had discussed proposals linked to territorial concessions.According to one account of a call between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders, the US president suggested supporting a Russian demand for full control over Donetsk and Lugansk in exchange for halting the offensive in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.Zelenskyy has firmly rejected those terms, insisting Ukraine will not abandon the Donbas.Despite diplomatic manoeuvres, fighting continues on the ground. Ukrainian officials reported on Monday that 13 people were wounded in Russian strikes on Kharkiv and the Sumy region. Both Kyiv and Moscow have also carried out drone attacks.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due in Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Donald Trump.

Trump federalises policing in Washington

Protests and pushback

Concerns over law enforcement role

White House claims success





National Guard members patrolling the US capital as part of President Donald Trump’s policing plan may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.Army Senior Master Sgt Craig Clapper was quoted by NPR as saying that “Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training.”He stressed their role was “focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve,” adding that the Guard “remains committed to assisting the District of Columbia and serving its residents and visitors whenever called upon.”Just days earlier, the Army had said Guard personnel would not carry weapons in public and would not be making arrests. At that point, officials insisted their weapons would remain in the armoury, to be used only if needed, and that deployed troops would instead act as a “visible crime deterrent” while equipped with protective gear such as body armour.The deployment follows President Trump’s announcement earlier this month that the federal government would assume control of the Metropolitan Police Department and flood Washington with hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members.According to the news agency AP, about 800 DC Guard members have already been activated.On Saturday, Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio pledged to send additional reinforcements, between 150 and 400 troops each, to strengthen the federal presence.“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Governor Patrick Morrisey said, as per AP.Trump has defended the takeover, claiming the city has been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people.”However, official data shows violent crime in Washington has actually fallen by 26% compared with last year.The move has triggered strong opposition from residents, local officials and activists, who say the federal intervention represents an overreach of power.DC Mayor Muriel Bowser warned on Friday that the city’s “limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.”On Saturday, hundreds marched from Dupont Circle to the White House, chanting against what they described as a “military occupation.” Protesters held banners reading “No fascist takeover of DC.”Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, was cited by AP as saying that she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for her students’ safety with “unmarked officers of all types” detaining people. John Finnigan, a local resident for nearly three decades, called Trump’s actions “ridiculous” given crime levels are falling.At the Asbury United Methodist Church on Sunday, Rev Ronald Bell Jr used his sermon to call on Black leaders to guide the community through the moment peacefully. Bell, who previously served in Minnesota during the unrest after George Floyd’s killing, said, “I think we have learned lessons from the past. I think we are well equipped to handle this moment.”Some experts have also raised alarms about the National Guard taking on quasi-policing duties. Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown Law professor and former reserve officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, was quoted by NPR as saying, “I think what we’re seeing is the effort to habituate people to the idea that you’re going to have armed federal personnel in your business, asking questions, stopping you, and that’s just truly scary. ”The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of federal armed forces in civilian law enforcement, unless specifically authorised by Congress. But Guard troops, who operate under state control unless federalised, have sometimes been deployed to cities with weapons, most recently to patrol the New York City transit system.Despite criticism, the White House insists Trump’s crackdown is working. Officials said that since 7 August, 308 people had been arrested in Washington, including 135 immigrants living in the US illegally. They added that 53 firearms had been seized.“President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,” spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said on Sunday.“In less than ten days, over 300 dangerous criminals have already been arrested and taken off the streets of Washington, DC President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American greatness to our cherished capital”, Rogers added.","National Guard members patrolling US capital may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi who is temporarily overseeing Washington DC’s police at President Donald Trump ’s request had announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent letters to sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. These jurisdictions have one week to comply with federal immigration laws or face potential legal action. Bondi contrasted South Carolina’s cooperation with Democratic-leaning states like New York and California.Bondi was in Greenville, South Carolina, for a panel discussion with State Attorney General Alan Wilson, members of Congress and local law enforcement officials. She had confirmed that letters had been sent to 32 mayors and several governors, warning them to follow federal policies or face DOJ action, as reported by Fox News.In a social media post on X, Bondi announced that DOJ has sent ""demand letters"" to sanctuary cities, counties and states as a “key step” in eliminating sanctuary policies from California to New York."" Threatening lawsuits, she said that ""any sanctuary jurisdiction that continues to put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens can either come to the table or see us in court.""The announcement comes amid concerns about law enforcement staffing in sanctuary cities. Following Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani ’s primary victory in New York, the New York City Police Department reportedly saw a surge in retirement filings.Bondi had also spoken out against current Mayor Eric Adams before, criticizing the city for being a sanctuary city. She stressed the importance of strong leadership for officer safety and urged federal, state and local governments to support law enforcement.Bondi specifically mentioned a letter sent to California Governor Gavin Newsom, warning that officials obstructing federal immigration enforcement could face criminal charges. The letter stressed the importance of cooperation between federal, state and local agencies to enforce immigration law and protect national security.She also praised South Carolina as a model of cooperation among federal, state and local law enforcement. She cited recent operations, including the arrest of a Sinaloa Cartel member after a large cocaine seizure in Myrtle Beach and the largest fentanyl seizure in the state’s history, which involved coordinated efforts by DEA agents, local sheriffs and state police. The seized fentanyl was estimated to have the potential to kill 36 million people and a street value of $1.7 million.Several states, including California, New York, Colorado and Illinois, have already faced lawsuits over their immigration policies. Others on the list include Delaware, Nevada, Minnesota and DC.",US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice has sent letters to sanctuary jurisdictions across the country.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump and would be “more than happy to meet” him, even as he warned that Trump’s words could “inadvertently radicalize people” and that he is “not a force for good.”The Labour politician dismissed Trump’s recent personal attacks, made during the US President’s visit to Scotland, in which Trump called Khan “a nasty person” who had “done a terrible job.” Khan described such comments as “water off a duck’s back”.However, speaking at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he admitted that the exchanges sometimes made him feel “nine years old again” and like he was “in the school playground,” as reported by the Independent.During the event, Khan had criticised Trump’s views on women, black people, LGBTQ+ individuals, Muslims and Mexicans.“Somebody who has views like he does about black people, about women, about gays, about Muslims, about Mexicans, thinks I’m nasty. Really. He is the leader of the free world, arguably the most powerful man in the world, and really.”Khan highlighted that since Trump began his second term in January, record numbers of Americans have applied for British citizenship and moved to London.“So I think Americans have got good taste by and large,” he said.He hoped that Trump would visit London during his upcoming state visit to the UK, emphasizing that the city’s diversity is a “strength, not a weakness.” Speaking about diversity, he added, “I think it makes us stronger not weaker, richer not poorer.""The London mayor warned that President Trump’s words can push extreme views into the mainstream and become potentially dangerous. He may unintentionally radicalize people, prompting harmful actions.Khan also highlighted that minorities in London could face discrimination because of the Trump’s statements. He accused US President of “using London and our diversity as a political football, as a proxy for a culture war.”Despite his criticisms, Khan said he would be “more than happy to meet President Trump”.The Labour politician said, “I suspect President Trump may have formed a view of Muslims because of the actions of a small minority of really bad people who are terrorists and use Islam in a perverted way.“What I would want President Trump to know is that is a very small fraction of Muslims across the globe. So if there was an opportunity to meet President Trump, I would be more than happy to do so.”","London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump.

Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said the White House has scored important wins during Friday’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, even though President Donald Trump did not get the ceasefire he had pushed for.Witkoff told CNN on Sunday that the most significant outcome was the agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine, described as “Article 5-like protections,” which he called “game-changing.”“We didn’t think that we were anywhere close to agreeing to Article Five protection from the United States in legislative enshrinement within the Russian Federation, not to go after any other territory when the peace deal is codified,” Witkoff said.He added that United States and other European nations reached an agreement to provide Article 5-like security guarantees.Ahead of the Alaska meeting, Trump had issued warnings about consequences if Russia did not commit to a ceasefire. Despite the high-profile summit, which included a red carpet welcome for Putin, no concrete plans for a follow-up meeting were established, as reported by Politico.Despite an inconclusive summit, Witkoff had expressed his optimism.He said the discussions marked the first time the US has seen meaningful accommodation from Russia, more than during previous administrations. He emphasized the need to build on this progress.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Washington on Monday to meet with Trump, accompanied by several European leaders. Trump has signaled willingness to contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv in a final settlement to help deter future Russian aggression.Trump’s former Vice President Mike Pence called Witkoff’s account of the proposed security guarantees “encouraging,” but warned the White House to keep in mind that Putin remains the main threat in the conflict.“I served alongside the president for four years. I know his style in dealing with these dictators,” Pence said. “It’s the velvet glove.

Senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of President Trump on Sunday said that he may push bipartisan legislation to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism if Moscow does not return Ukrainian children it has reportedly kidnapped.Russia has been accused of abducting over 20,000 Ukrainian children during its war in Ukraine, with some reportedly placed for adoption in an effort to raise them as Russians. Some Ukrainian officials estimate the number could be closer to 35000, as reported by New York Post.“I intend to push for the return of these children until I can’t push anymore,” Graham said on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures. He warned that if Russia does not return the children, the United States should label it a state sponsor of terrorism, a move he said would make Russia “radioactive.”The kidnappings are viewed by Kyiv officials and human rights organizations as part of a broader Russian strategy to expand influence over Ukraine. In some cases, abducted children have reportedly been forced to fight against Ukrainian forces.The White House has stressed that the mass abduction of Ukrainian children “remains a concern.” First Lady Melania Trump also delivered a letter to Putin urging peace and highlighting the impact of the war on children.Graham said any peace agreement should include the return of the abducted children. “They should be a state sponsor of terrorism, Russia, until they return the children. So any peace deal must include the return of the kidnapped children by Russia to Ukraine,” Graham said.Alongside Senator Richard Blumenthal, Graham has introduced a bipartisan sanctions bill targeting Russia. However, President Trump has indicated that he may act unilaterally with secondary tariffs and sanctions.“The way to end this war is to make Russia believe that, if they don’t end it, we’re going to destroy their fossil fuel economy,” Graham said.“I’m going to let him [Trump] determine that,” Graham said about the timing of when that sanctions bill might get passed. “I trust his judgment. I can’t think of a better person to be in the room with Putin than President Trump.”Graham expressed cautious optimism about the prospect of ending the ongoing conflict. President Trump is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, alongside European leaders who support Ukraine.","Russia has been accused of abducting over 20,000 Ukrainian children during its war in Ukraine, with some reportedly placed for adoption in an effort to raise them as Russians.

Former vice-president Mike Pence on Sunday called on President Donald Trump to bring the “hammer down” on Russian President Vladimir Putin and impose additional sanctions on Russia.Pence praised Trump for pursuing peace in Ukraine after his Alaska summit with Putin on Friday but urged him to intensify pressure to secure a peace deal.“I served alongside the president for four years. I know his style in dealing with these dictators. It’s the velvet glove, but I think the hammer needs to come, and it needs to come immediately,” Pence said.“[Trump] ought to pick up the phone and ask Majority Leader John Thune to immediately pass the secondary sanctions bill that is supported by virtually everyone in the United States Senate,” he added.Pence emphasized that the Russian president is “the bad guy” and he should be treated as such during negotiations, as reported by news agency CNN.Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have championed a sanctions bill against Russia with over 80 senators backing it. Trump dismissed the bill as unnecessary and instead issued an ultimatum to Putin, demanding that the Russian leader take steps toward peace by August 8 or face strict secondary sanctions and tariffs.Following a Kremlin meeting with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, the president opted to hold a direct summit rather than impose immediate sanctions.Pence warned that Putin might be trying to “run out the clock” to postpone sanctions that could severely impact Russia’s economy. He was not surprised that the historic meeting failed to produce a ceasefire agreement.“There was an agreement by President Zelensky to a cease-fire back in February. Putin refused it. He’s managed to delay the game,” the ex-VP said. “All the while, his military has continued its brutal assault on civilian populations in Ukraine.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration against criticism of delaying sanctions, saying that acting too quickly could undermine ongoing peace negotiations.Trump is scheduled to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, with several European leaders joining the Ukrainian president’s visit. Pence expressed hope that the meeting would be productive and foster unity among Western leaders.“I’m also going to be praying that it’s a productive time and a unifying time among all the leaders in the West and the president and President Zelenskyy,” Pence said.","Pence praised Trump for pursuing peace in Ukraine after his Alaska summit with Putin on Friday but urged him to intensify pressure to secure a peace deal. “I served alongside the president for four years.

Pakistan is grappling with relentless monsoon rains, as officials warn of even heavier downpours in the coming days.The death toll due to the flash flood continues to climb, killing at least 327 people in the country’s north, bringing the nationwide toll to nearly 650 since the rains began on 26 June.On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department issued a fresh alert, warning of heavier rainfall nationwide, from 17 to 21 August. It urged residents in the northwest to take ""precautionary measures"" amid fears of worsening floods.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said the downpours, which began earlier than usual this year, are expected to continue with greater intensity over the next fortnight, as per PTI.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa saw the hardest hit, with 327 deaths confirmed so far. The Buner district alone has reported more than 200 fatalities, making it the worst-affected area. At least 137 people have been injured across the province as houses collapsed and raging torrents swept away residents, livestock and vehicles.Rescue efforts are proving difficult. Nearly 2,000 personnel have been deployed, but landslides, washed-out bridges and broken link routes have slowed relief work.""Heavy rainfall, landslides and washed-out roads are severely hampering rescue efforts, particularly the transportation of heavy machinery and ambulances,"" Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency told PTI.""In some areas, workers are forced to walk long distances to reach disaster sites. They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.""Buner’s deputy commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan confirmed that rescuers were searching for alternative routes to reach cut-off areas. ""Many more people may still be trapped under the debris, which local residents cannot clear manually,"" he said.The Pakistan Army’s Corps of Engineers Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team has also launched operations in Buner, Shangla and Swat. Using advanced equipment, they are working to recover those trapped under rubble while also repairing damaged roads and bridges. Local villagers have joined the effort, combing through debris with their bare hands.Funerals were being held across devastated villages, as survivors struggled to search through the ruins by hands. ""I helped retrieve the bodies of children I taught,"" said Saifullah Khan, a schoolteacher in Buner. ""The trauma is unbearable.""On Saturday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur visited Buner to review rescue and relief operations. According to a briefing given to him, cloudbursts struck seven village councils in the district, destroying 5,380 houses. So far, 209 deaths have been confirmed, with 134 people still missing and 159 injured.Rescue personnel, doctors, paramedics, police, civil defence volunteers and three battalions of the Pakistan Army are working together. Around 3,500 stranded people have been evacuated to safety, while the search for the missing continues. Gandapur pledged that the provincial government would provide full support, PTI reported.“No effort will be spared in the rehabilitation of flood victims. The provincial government will provide all necessary resources on a priority basis,” he said. He also announced the release of Rs 1.5 billion for relief and rehabilitation.Authorities have now declared six districts, Buner, Bajaur, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra and Battagram, as disaster-hit.Nationwide, the NDMA reported that torrential monsoon rains have left more than 650 people dead and 905 injured this season.Floodwaters have destroyed livestock, shops, vehicles and vital infrastructure. While some key roads reopened temporarily on Saturday, many remote areas remain cut off.","At least 327 people have been killed in the country's north since the rains began on 26 June.

PESHAWAR: The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday, with one resident in worst-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Buner saying the torrents “came like fire”.The devastation, caused by heavy monsoon rains, came without warning. Villagers in Buner said it wasn’t rainwater but a wall of mud and boulders crashing down the mountains. “It felt as if the sky broke apart. We had no chance to run,” said Gul Zarin, a shopkeeper who lost his brother.Buner alone accounted for over 200 fatalities. Dozens were still missing. Neighbouring districts -- Swat, Bajaur, Dir, Shangla, Mansehra, and Kohistan -- were left in ruins as swollen rivers swept away homes, bridges, and police outposts. For many Pakistanis, the scenes recall the 2022 disaster that killed over 1,700 people and submerged a third of the country.Met department warned of more rain till Aug 21 in the region, with cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts still a danger. Relief operations remain hampered by broken roads and washed-away bridges.Even rescuers were not spared. A govt helicopter ferrying relief supplies to Bajaur crashed in heavy rain, killing all five on board, including two pilots.One had messaged his wife earlier in the day: “Don’t worry, I’ll be back tonight.”For survivors, the destruction is personal. In Pir Baba, a mother sat on the rubble of her home, holding a sodden schoolbag. “This is all I found of my son,” she whispered. The nine-year-old, who dreamed of becoming a teacher, was washed away with hundreds of others.In Shangla, villagers dug with bare hands to retrieve the dead. “We buried them ourselves. “There was no one else to help,” said a teenage boy, his face streaked with dust.The floods are now pushing south. Rising waters in Swabi and Mardan threaten to spill into the Indus plains. Farmers have begun moving cattle and bedding to higher ground. “We can see the river swelling every hour. If it breaks, we will lose everything,” said one farmer.Although the fury reminded many of the 2022 floods, this year’s devastation has been swifter and more violent. Scientists warn that a warming atmosphere is turning each monsoon into a greater threat.The grief, however, is not Pakistan’s alone. The same rivers and monsoon systems bind South Asia. “Maybe people across the border heard this thunder too. It was the sound of our lives breaking,” said a resident of Dir.Beyond statistics, a survivor’s words revealed the raw truth: “We were not warned -- only buried. The state comes too late, the water too fast. Our children’s future is drowning with us.” This monsoon has left Pakistan with a stark reminder: climate reckoning respects no borders.","The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.
