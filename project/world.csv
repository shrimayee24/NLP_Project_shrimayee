Ram Rahim plea: HC resumes hearing in journo murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ram-rahim-plea-hc-resumes-hearing-in-journo-murder-case/articleshow/127873636.cms,"Gurmeet Ram Rahim

CHANDIGARH: Citing the “emergence of new facts”, Punjab and Haryana HC has resumed hearing in the Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case, more than four months after reserving its verdict on the appeal filed by Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and others.“The appeals have been finally heard on Sept 25, 2025. However, while dictating the judgment, some new facts have emerged, which require further clarification for proper adjudication of the matter,” a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Vikram Aggarwal observed in its order released on Jan 30, while starting re-hearing of the matter.On Jan 17, 2019, a special CBI court in Panchkula had sentenced the Dera chief and three others to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, editor of ‘Poora Sach’ newspaper.The Dera chief challenged the conviction before HC, claiming that he had been falsely implicated by CBI as the first chargesheet against other accused, Nirmal, Kuldeep and Krishan Lal, had already been filed and none of them had alleged his involvement in the conspiracy.Counsel for Gurmeet Ram Rahim contended that he was not named in the first chargesheet filed by police in 2002 and that his name was included in it “by way of revenge”.“The investigating agency failed to prove that the appellant ever read the said newspaper (Poora Sach). As per the prosecution’s own story, it was an evening newspaper and only reported news that had already been published by the morning newspapers. There was, thus, no question of the appellant having any grudge against the deceased,” the Dera chief’s petition stated.",Punjab and Haryana HC has resumed hearing in the Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case.

"Ban entry of non-Hindus at UP temples, says VHP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ban-entry-of-non-hindus-at-up-temples-says-vhp/articleshow/127873607.cms,"""Not for tourism"": VHP International President backs ban on non-hindus' entry into temples

LUCKNOW: VHP demanded Monday a ban on entry of non-Hindus at major temples in UP, including Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, widening a simmering national debate over religious sanctity and public access.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal said Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains could be exempted, contending their faiths originated in India. He alleged attempts by “ill-intentioned” non-Hindus to enter temples. On Jan 10, a 55-year-old man from J&K, identified as Ahmed Sheikh, was detained after allegedly attempting to offer namaz inside Ram Janmabhoomi temple complex. Family members said he was not mentally sound.VHP’s demand follows similar moves in Uttarakhand, where temple committees of Gangotri and Badrinath-Kedarnath have announced plans to bar non-Hindus from shrines starting with upcoming Char Dham Yatra season, after portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri reopen in April. Bansal said temples were places of worship, not tourist attractions. “The temples are not tourist spots for making reels. They are meant for worship,” he said, adding the ban should be strictly enforced to restrict the entry of people whom he described as “anasthawan” (non-believers).Pressure to restrict access has also come from Haridwar, where Ganga Sabha, a trust managing religious affairs of ghats, has demanded a ban on non-Hindus at 2027 Kumbh Mela.","VHP demands ban on entry of non-Hindus at major temples in UP.

KASARAGOD: Fresh parole to a convict in Kerala’s Periya double-murder case reignited political outrage, with Congress-headed opposition boycotting the assembly on Monday after the speaker blocked an urgent debate over repeated releases of prisoners.The case involves the 2019 political killing of Youth Congress workers Kripesh and Sarath Lal in Periya, a village in Kasaragod district in northern Kerala. CPM workers were convicted and handed double life terms by a trial court.Tenth accused Ranjith T was granted 15-day parole Monday, barely two-and-a-half months after similar relief earlier. Prime convict A Peethambaran and another convict, Gijin, are also out on parole, drawing sharp criticism and scrutiny of prison rules. Kannur jail authorities said parole followed jail rules. In Sept 2025, three CPM workers were given 30 days’ parole.Tension spilled into the assembly. RMP MLA K K Rema sought an adjournment motion alleging procedures were violated in granting parole to CPM workers. Speaker AN Shamseer rejected the motion.Opposition members shouted slogans, accusing the speaker of shielding LDF govt. Opposition leader VD Satheesan of Congress questioned the rejection and cited VK Nishad, sentenced to 20 years for a bomb attack on police, who was granted parole within a month of conviction. As protests continued, UDF legislators walked out for the day.","Tenth accused Ranjith T was granted 15-day parole Monday, barely two-and-a-half months after similar relief earlier.

Maharashtra Murder News: Father of 3 kills daughter to meet 2-child norm for contesting Maharashtra panchayat polls; ex-sarpanch helped plot murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/man-with-3-kids-kills-daughter-to-contest-maha-panchayat-poll/articleshow/127870557.cms,"



HYDERABAD: Telangana police have arrested a man from Maharashtra for murdering one of his three children so that he would be eligible to contest the gram panchayat election. Those with more than two children are barred from contesting local body elections in Maharashtra.Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, who was arrested on Monday, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad on Jan 29. ""Pandurang first had twin daughters, including Prachi,"" a police officer told TOI. ""Later, he had a son too. He decided to kill Prachi to realise his political ambitions.""Officials also arrested the present sarpanch of Kerur, Ganesh Shinde, for allegedly helping Pandurang plan the murder.The killing came to light after police officers from Nizamabad's Bodhan rural police station started investigating the suspicious death of an unknown girl, whose body was found in the Nizamsagar canal. To identify the girl, a constable uploaded a photograph of the body as his status message on WhatsApp and asked people to share leads. The image was also shared with other police stations.Within a few hours police officers from Mukhed taluk in Maharashtra contacted their counterparts in Bodhan and identified the girl as Prachi, barber Pandurang's daughter, who had been missing for a few days.Bodhan police officials then got in touch with Pandurang and found that he was giving inconsistent replies to many of their queries.Suspecting that Pandurang had killed his daughter, police officials tracked his mobile phone's tower locations and found out that he had brought Prachi to Telangana. During interrogation, he allegedly cracked and confessed to killing Prachi.Officials alleged that Ganesh encouraged Pandurang to contest the panchayat elections, due in about six months. However, both realised that Pandurang would be ineligible as a candidate as he had three children.Nizamabad police commissioner P Sai Chaitanya said the duo initially tried to give the girl up for adoption to couples wanting children. ""When the attempt failed, they allegedly conspired to kill Prachi. On Jan 29, Pandurang came to Nizamsagar canal with Prachi and pushed her into the water before returning to his village,"" Sai Chaitanya said.","Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, Maharashtra, was arrested on Monday.

"Amid threats to ‘chicken’s neck’, India to take rail corridor underground",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-threats-to-chickens-neck-india-to-take-rail-corridor-underground/articleshow/127871006.cms,"Union railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (PTI photo)

GUWAHATI: India’s plan to secure the strategic “chicken’s neck” corridor to the Northeast from Bengal includes laying underground rail tracks through the nearly 40km stretch flanked by Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Monday.Vaishnaw said the Budget contains a proposal to expand railway link between the region and the rest of the country to four tracks, fulfilling a long-felt need. Northeast Frontier Railway GM Chetan Shrivastava said the underground stretch would run from Tin Mile Haat to Rangapani stations within Bengal.Decision to take the tracks underground stems from threats — overt and covert — to target the chicken’s neck, which is barely 25km wide at the narrowest point. Concerns over the corridor, being seen as India’s Achilles heel, grew after the fall of Hasina govt in Bangladesh, with some groups speaking about “choking the chicken’s neck” to cut off the Northeast. Voices have framed the region as part of their vision of a “greater Bangladesh”. Dhaka’s outreach towards China is another red flag.During the 2017 Doklam stand-off, military planners had talked about the vulnerability of the Siliguri stretch of the corridor. Any disruption here could isolate NE, severing supply lines and impeding movement of troops.“Taking the tracks underground is part of the strategy to ensure connectivity even in times of crises,” an official said.","Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Budget contains a proposal to expand railway link between the region and the rest of the country to four tracks.

Trump Announces India-US Trade Deal, Reduces Reciprocal Tariffs On Delhi To 18%; PM Modi Reacts

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Monday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump announced an ""immediate"" India-US trade deal from Washington, adding New Delhi would move to cut tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods while the US reduces reciprocal tariffs on India.In a post on X, Ramesh alleged that key announcements impacting India, including the halt of Operation Sindoor, updates on India’s crude purchases from Russia and Venezuela, and now the trade deal itself, were being made from the US capital.""He announced the halt of Op Sindoor from Washington DC. He announced the updates on India’s oil purchases from Russia and Venezuela from Washington.

It appears Mr. Modi has capitulated finally. Surely this cannot be the father of all deals. In Washington clearly Mogambo Khush Hai,"" he said.The Congress leader's remarks came minutes after Trump, in his Truth Social post, said India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and would buy “much more” from the US and potentially Venezuela, arguing the shift would help end the Russia-Ukraine war. He also said the US would lower reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 18% and that India would move to reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the US to “zero”.Later, PM Modi thanked Trump for the tariff announcement. In a post on X, the Prime Minister said he was “delighted” that Made in India products would get a reduced tariff of 18%, and thanked the US President “on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” for the “wonderful announcement”.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump announced an ""immediate"" India-US trade deal from Washington.

12-yr-old lured into trading Rs 85L jewellery for ‘unlimited momos’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-yr-old-lured-into-trading-rs-85l-jewellery-for-unlimited-momos/articleshow/127871310.cms,"Generative image

LUCKNOW: Gold buys food. In eastern Uttar Pradesj, food brought gold. For a 12-year-old schoolboy, an offer of unlimited free momos was worth more than the metal locked in a family cupboard. For two roadside vendors, the boy’s craving turned into a gold mine.Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers near Dumari Chauraha in Deoria — about 350km east of Lucknow — trading ornaments for what he was promised would be a lifetime supply of free dumplings. The trail surfaced when jewellery vanished from the cupboard. The boy’s mother and aunt went looking. The cupboard was empty. Questions followed. The child broke down and told his father he had traded the valuables for “unlimited free food for a lifetime”.According to a complaint filed by the boy’s father, a temple priest, the child had grown fond of momo sold at the roadside stall.The vendors allegedly began feeding him free of cost, winning trust bite by bite. Soon came bigger offers — food, small sums of money, loyalty.Then persuasion. Unaware of the stakes, the boy began removing jewellery from home and handing it over, police said.Gold necklaces. Rings. Bangles. Mangtika. Nose pins. Earrings. Silver toe rings. Family heirlooms, one snack at a time. The vendors vanished soon enough.The priest approached police on Feb 1, alleging the momo sellers threatened the child with dire consequences to keep him silent. Police teams are now searching for the two fugitives and tracing the jewellery trail, SHO Devendra Kumar Singh said, adding legal action will follow. Other suspects are also being questioned.",Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers.

Two suspects detained in Samba; searches launched in Udhampur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-suspects-detained-in-samba-searches-launched-in-udhampur/articleshow/127870532.cms,"Representative photo

JAMMU: Two terror suspects were detained in Cantonment Area in J&K’s Samba district on Monday, even as multiple cordon-and-search operations continued across several regions of Jammu division, including snowbound Kishtwar’s Chatroo-Dolgam-Dichhar belt, where Operation Trashi-I entered its 16th day. Late Sunday, a search operation was launched in Joffer area in Udhampur’s Rampur sector following reports of suspicious movement.“Terrorist movement was reported in the upper reaches of Udhampur. Search operations are also underway in the high-altitude, forested areas of Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Doda, and Reasi districts,” an official said.Around 10.30am Monday, a Quick Reaction Team caught two men near an old quarter of the Army in railway area. “One person was sleeping outside, near the shaft, while the other was found inside. Both were taken into custody and sent to Bari Brahmana PS for further action,” an official source said. “One of the men was identified as Muneer Khan from Chang, in Jammu district. He said he works in Flaxfour Company, Bari Brahmana. The other man was identified as Pawan Singh from Neeli village in Udhampur district,” the source added.On Jan 6, Punjab Police detained a minor in Pathankot on charges of spying and for allegedly sharing confidential information via social media to terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers. The detention prompted a statewide alert for similar espionage activities involving children.Due to its proximity to the international border, Samba serves as a gateway for terrorists to reach Kashmir Valley via the upper reaches of Samba-Udhampur-Doda-Kishtwar. The district remains a hotspot of terrorist activities.Under Operation Trashi-I, security forces have engaged in four encounters with terrorists in the past fortnight. Initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed. On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead. A brief gun battle occurred in Dolgam on Jan 31.Braving inclement weather, troops have been trudging through hostile, forested terrain to track and kill a group of three holed-up ultras. Security agencies were also trying to trace terrorist sympathisers who may have helped the ultras with food and shelter. Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.Officials said the terrorists, on the run for more than two weeks now, had been continuously changing hideouts. Additional forces were roped in to fortify the cordon, and sniffer dogs were deployed to assist the troops on the ground. The region was put under aerial surveillance using drones and choppers to plug possible escape routes.",Two terror suspects were detained in Cantonment Area in J&K’s Samba district on Monday.

JAMMU: J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) on Monday urged BJP to move beyond demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu and instead press the Centre to restore statehood to the Union territory.Surinder Choudhary, deputy chief minister in the Omar Abdullah-led govt, accused BJP of raising the NLU issue as part of its claims about discrimination against Jammu while remaining silent on larger concerns.“They (BJP) wake up every morning and start shouting that the Omar govt is discriminating against Jammu,” NC’s Choudhary said on the opening day of the J&K assembly’s 27-day budget session in Jammu.J&K has no NLU at present but the demand for it to be located in Jammu gained traction after CM Omar said last year that it would come up in Kashmir’s Budgam. Omar has rejected the recent BJP demands, calling the controversy “politically motivated” and pointing out that there were no protests in the Valley when Jammu was given both an IIT and an IIM.Deputy CM Choudhary stressed that J&K faced far more pressing issues than NLU and accused BJP of abandoning its promise of restoring statehood. “Why is he not asking the Centre to fulfil the promise of statehood,” Choudhary said.He was referring to Sunil Sharma, BJP leader of opposition who joined students’ protests at Jammu University over the NLU.A legislator from Jammu’s Nowshera, Choudhary rejected allegations of discrimination, arguing the NC govt would not have revived the “Darbar Move” after four years if that was the case.In June 2021, LG Sinha’s administration ended the Darbar Move, a 149-year-old practice of shifting the seat of govt between Srinagar and Jammu every six months. Sinha described the system as “a big racket”. Before its abolition, over 10,000 state employees shuttled between the two cities twice a year, boosting trade and commerce in Jammu. The Omar-led govt resumed it this year after demands from Jammu’s traders, who said its suspension had hurt business.Referring to the NLU demand, deputy CM Choudhary flagged “lack of statehood” as the biggest issue, leading to local jobs being taken away by “outsiders”. “BJP has a habit of sitting on roads and accusing the govt of discrimination. But they don’t look at Jammu University, where not a single vice-chancellor has been from Jammu. Are our professors from Jammu not capable of leading the university? But BJP will not talk about it,” Choudhary said.",J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) on Monday urged BJP to move beyond demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu.

'Nonsense, Lies': BJP Blasts Rahul Gandhi For Citing Ex-Army Chief Naravane's Memoir, Oppn Hits Back

Opposition defends LoP, cites national security

'I'm quoting an article': Rahul Gandhi reiterates his stance

NEW DELHI: The Budget Session of Parliament witnessed sharp exchanges on Monday after Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from an unpublished memoir of former Army chief Gen MM Naravane (retd) during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address.The incident triggered strong objections from the treasury benches, leading to repeated disruptions and adjournments. Following the prolonged deadlock, the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day and will reconvene at 11 am on Tuesday.The controversy erupted when Gandhi rose to respond to remarks by BJP MP Tejasvi Surya , who had questioned the Congress party’s nationalism. Gandhi said that he wanted to counter those allegations by citing passages related to the India-China border situation from what he described as the former Army chief’s memoir.However, defence minister Rajnath Singh objected, questioning whether the book being cited had been formally published or authenticated. He told the House that unpublished material could not be quoted and accused the Congress leader of misleading Parliament.Speaker Om Birla subsequently ruled that unpublished books or magazine articles not directly related to the proceedings could not be read out in the House.Despite the ruling, Congress leader maintained that the excerpts he was referring to were authentic and available through a published magazine article citing the memoir, triggering repeated protests from treasury benches and counter-sloganeering from the Opposition.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju later accused Gandhi of defying the Speaker and violating House rules. Speaking to reporters, Rijiju said the Leader of Opposition had ignored the Chair’s ruling repeatedly.“Right from the beginning, Rahul Gandhi flouted rules. Even after the Speaker’s ruling, he kept repeating the same mistake and wasted half an hour of the House,” Rijiju said.Union minister Giriraj Singh also criticised Gandhi’s conduct, calling it “childish behaviour.” He said the dignity of the House required members to adhere strictly to the agenda under discussion.“The way Rahul Gandhi is displaying indiscipline and refusing to obey the Speaker’s orders is unfortunate. He should have confined himself to the President’s Address,” Singh said.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal described the episode as unprecedented and embarrassing. “This must have happened for the first time since Independence that a member was asked repeatedly to stop and still continued. His address was condemnable and action should be taken,” Pal said.The Opposition, however, rallied firmly behind Gandhi, accusing the government of stifling debate on national security. Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Gandhi was not attempting to defame the armed forces.“He was not trying to defame the army. He was reading an excerpt attributed to a former Army chief. The government always reacts like this when something uncomfortable comes out,” she said.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ""He never got a chance to lay out his concerns. The article does not blame the forces or the soldiers at all. The issue is about some of the decisions that were taken or not taken by the central government. And that clearly is what Rahul ji intended to raise. All I can say is I think the government did not need to overreact.""Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said that it was unfortunate that the Leader of Opposition was not allowed to speak on an issue of national importance. “National security is a crucial issue. Not allowing him to speak on this matter is not right. We hope the Speaker will give justice,” Hooda said.Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that Gandhi had raised substantive issues related to Doklam, Ladakh and India-China relations. Accusing the government of avoiding scrutiny, Singhvi said, “Instead of answering questions, you are blocking them. This suppresses matters of public interest.”Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee alleged that Parliament was losing its democratic character. “Every right of MPs is being taken away. If someone has violated rules, there are procedures, but this is not the way,” he said.Congress MP Karti Chidambaram questioned the demand for an apology over historical events. “What happened in 1962 happened in 1962. Rahul Gandhi was not part of the government then. We want to discuss the conduct of the present government, which the former Army chief has written about,” he said, adding that those views appeared “inconvenient” for the ruling dispensation.TMC MP Mahua Moitra widened the attack, alleging intimidation of Opposition voices both inside and outside Parliament. She cited restrictions faced by people at Banga Bhawan in Delhi as an example of shrinking democratic space.As tempers flared, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav urged the Speaker to allow the Leader of Opposition to speak, saying issues related to China were sensitive and deserved discussion.Despite interventions, the deadlock persisted, forcing multiple adjournments of the Lok Sabha before proceedings were finally suspended for the day.During the session, Gandhi defended his attempt to raise the issue, asserting that national security should not be curtailed in parliamentary debate. Speaking inside the House amid the uproar, he said that the matter had made the government uncomfortable.“I consider national security to be the most important issue in the country. I understand that it has made the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister uncomfortable. If they are not, they should allow me to speak. Rajnath Singh ji is sitting here and he is aware of this matter. He is the person who spoke to General Naravane,” Gandhi said.After the House was adjourned, the Congress leader reiterated his position while speaking to reporters outside Parliament, insisting that he was not expressing personal views but referring to the former Army chief’s account.“This is not me, this is what the Army Chief (former) has written in a book. The book is not being allowed to be published. It is languishing, and this is the Army Chief's perspective,” Gandhi said.Questioning the government’s objections, he asked why it was reluctant to allow discussion on the contents attributed to the memoir.“Why are they so scared of what the Army Chief has to say? We will learn something from it. Of course, we will learn something about a Prime Minister. We will learn something about Rajnath Singh ji. But we will also learn something about the Army and how it was let down by the political leadership of the country,” he said.Congress leader further claimed that the references to the memoir had already appeared in a published article and that he was quoting from that source.“I am quoting the article. They are not letting me speak. They are scared because if it comes out, the reality of Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh will be revealed to the people and what happened to the 56-inch chest when China was standing against us, advancing?” he asked.","Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day and will reconvene at 11 am on Tuesday.

NASHIK: The Jalgaon health department cancelled nearly 3,000 delayed birth and death certificates after it found they were generated illegally, and reported the matter to the state govt.Dr Sachin Bhayekar, the district health officer, said the administration, at the beginning of Jan 2026, received information that illegal delayed birth and death certificates were generated and delivered from Bhatpuri village in Parola taluka. Subsequently, an investigation was launched.“Upon going through the details, the district administration found that since 2016, when the online process for registration began, a user ID was generated for Bhatpuri, a far-flung village, but it was never used. However, at least 4,907 delayed birth and death certificates were generated from the village,” the officer said. The matter came to light after the administration got an alert from the Yavatmal district administration about several certificates being generated from Bhatpuri.It was found the certificates were issued for the period 2010 to 2025, and they were all processed during Nov-Dec 2025. “The names in whose favour the certificates were generated included the likes of Sarita Devi and Gopal Das, and some Muslim-sounding names.However, Patil, Mahajan, Bhil, etc, are the common surnames of people who live around this area. The investigation also covered the neighbouring village of Ratale but, there too, people with such names/surnames were not found,” Bhayekar said.The district administration conducted a thorough investigation and found that there was no record of these names. The health department raised the issue with state govt and informed the state registrar. Following directives from the state registrar, the health department started cancelling the certificates. So far, close to 3,000 certificates have been cancelled. The entire process will be completed in a week’s time.Bhayekar said a special investigation team was set up at the district level.

NEW DELHI: Noting that there have been frequent cases of drunk minors snuffing out innocent lives while driving cars, SC Monday said their parents are to be blamed for allowing them to drink and drive. It, however, granted bail to three accused in Pune Porsche accident case in which two young engineers died while a minor was allegedly at the wheel.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said that there cannot be punishment before trial and directed release of the accused who already spent 18 months in jail. They were allegedly involved in tampering of evidence by swapping blood samples of their kids with their own. Father of the main accused, who is a minor and was allegedly driving the case, is still in jail.SC, however, lamented over prevailing social conditions where well-off parents do not spare time for their children and try to compensate for it by giving them money and lofty gifts like sports cars. It said such parents are to be blamed when their minors crush innocent people on road with their cars.“Something has to be said about parents. Parents were unable to control the children. They took keys. Celebration cannot be driving at full speed and killing people on footpath or the poor. This is not the first time such a thing has happened. Law has to catch up. The main one responsible is parents who give money to kids to have a gala time. Parents have no time to spend with children and talk to them. Instead they give mobile, ATM cards and cars,” the bench observed.The accused moved SC after their bail plea was rejected by Bombay HC.

BENGALURU: What should have been an ordinary, even joyful, phase of life has been violently upended for 31-year-old Shalini Kumari Dubey, a Bengaluru professional and mother to a 17-month-old toddler.Days that once revolved around work, cuddles and caring for her breastfeeding child are now spent in a hospital bed, recovering from a brutal dog attack that has left her with more than 80 stitches across her face, throat and head — and scars that go far beyond the physical.Early on Jan 26, Shalini had stepped out for morning walk near home in HSR Layout’s Teachers’ Colony.A neighbour’s pet Rottweiler allegedly released onto the road without a leash or muzzle, lunged at her, pinning her to the ground and attacking her face and neck.CCTV footage shows the dog charging at the woman the moment its owner opened the gate.“There was no chain, no muzzle, no safety measures,” said Shalini’s husband Satya Prakash Dubey. Shalini survived, but only just. She underwent nearly eight hours of surgery. One deep wound, 7cm long, was dangerously close to her airway. “Another centimetre and it could have been fatal,” Satya Prakash said.Doctors have warned that some scars may be permanent. Hospitalised for more than a week, Shalini struggles with flashbacks and anxiety and has begun consulting a clinical psychologist.For Shalini, the big worry is whether her young child will recognise her due to her facial injuries. A police complaint was filed after the hospital flagged it as a medico-legal case. An FIR was registered against the dog’s owner, N Amaresh Reddy, for negligence. Neighbours claim the dog had displayed aggressive behaviour earlier as well. Satya Prakash said a delivery executive was once attacked.“There were warnings. The owners ought to have acted back then. This is not about dogs-versus-humans. This is about irresponsible ownership. My wife’s life changed forever. No family should go through this,” Satya Prakash said.","Shalini Kumari Dubey, 31, is a mother to a 17-month-old toddler.

'Regime Changes In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal Building Cases Of Bad Governance': NSA Ajit Doval

NEW DELHI: Justifying detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk under National Security Act, govt on Monday told Supreme Court that he was trying to create political and social unrest in Ladakh and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.Appearing before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the activist was appealing to Gen Z to come out on the street against govt to create a problem in Ladakh which is very sensitive as it shares borders with countries that are not very friendly. Responding to Wangchuk’s submission that he was holding a peaceful protest against govt on the line of Gandhian principles, the SG said, “Gandhi was just a facade to hide his real intention of instigating violence. ”Mehta said the activist was detained as per law and there was no violation in the procedure. He said the order of detention was served upon him which took almost four hours as he was shown all of his offensive video clips which was relied upon to detain him. The entire procedure was videograpped.Reading out Wangchuk’s speech, the SG told SC he was talking about the Arab Spring and what happened in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to instigate people to come out in large numbers against govt. “You are asking Gen Z to come out. You are anticipating or hoping for a riot-like situation in Nepal. It is a clear instigation...

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from Centre and states on a petition by National Council of Churches alleging freedom of religion laws enacted by states violate citizens’ fundamental rights by criminalising voluntary and conscience-based conversions and arguing that prior govt-approval for conversion violates individuals’ right to privacy.One of the laws challenged by the association is the nearly 60-year-old Orissa Freedom of Religion Act, 1967. Madhya Pradesh had enacted Chhattisgarh Dharma Swatantrya Adhiniyam in 1968 to prevent large-scale conversion of tribals.SC had upheld the constitutional validity of the Orissa and MP laws in 1977 in Rev Stanislaus vs State of MP case and said while the right to propagate religion is a fundamental right, it does not include right to convert.Arunachal had enacted a similar law in 1978; Gujarat in 2003; Himachal in 2007; Jharkhand in 2017; Uttarakhand in 2018; MP, UP and Karnataka in 2021; and Haryana in 2022. Given the challenges to state freedom of religion laws in several HCs, SC had transferred all petitions to itself in 2023. Rajasthan passed freedom of religion law in 2025.Challenging all the laws, the churches association, through senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, said the laws presume all conversions happen through allurement, fraud or coercion and hence call for prior intimation and inquiry and permission from a district magistrate, thus compelling individuals to justify personal decisions.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said states have sufficient basis to enact these laws and that a constitution bench of SC has already approved the constitutional validity of these laws. That decision covers the pending cases as well as this fresh one, he held.The petitioner said the laws have deliberately defined conversion, allurement and inducement vaguely to give uncanalised discretion to the authorities, which ‘produces a chilling effect on free speech, religious propagation’. The association said stricter provisions relating to conversion of women in freedom of religion laws “deny women equal decisional autonomy”.The petitioner said, “Implementation of the impugned Acts across states reveals a uniform pattern of misuse. Routine worship, prayer meetings, charitable activities and interfaith marriages are criminalised through expansive interpretations of ‘allurement’ and ‘inducement’.”“Vigilante groups function as de facto enforcers, while police authorities act mechanically on complaints without independent scrutiny. This state-enabled vigilantism legitimises social hostility, instils fear among minority communities, thereby corroding the secular fabric of the Constitution,” it said.","Supreme Court seeks responses from Centre and states on petition by National Council of Churches.

BJP to replace Biren at helm in Manipur

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday moved to install a popular govt in Manipur, where President’s rule will complete one year on Feb 12, with its legislative party set to elect a new leader.Official sources said BJP MLAs are in the national capital and will be electing a new leader, who will be sworn in as the new chief minister. The party has not officially declared a date for the legislative party meeting and named its general secretary Tarun Chugh as the central observer for the election of the new leader.The Centre had brought the state, where BJP enjoys a majority in the 60-member assembly, under President’s rule on Feb 13 following a long spell of ethnic violence involving Meiteis and Kukis, leading to displacement of the members of two communities to areas where they are dominant .President’s rule was imposed days after resignation of CM Biren Singh.

EC also complained about the state’s failure to spare officers at the level of sub-magistrate or tehsildar, for deployment as EROs or assistant EROs.EC pointed out that it had on Jan 20 moved a proposal for appointment of returning officers (ROs) as per the criteria. “At present ROs in only 67 assembly constituencies are of SDO/SDM rank.”Other prickly issues raised by EC on Monday include transfers of three electoral roll observers in Bengal without consultation with EC. It had requested for cancellation of transfer orders on Jan 27 but no action has been reported so far.Bengal govt has, as per an EC source, also defied EC’s instructions dated Aug 5, 2025 to register FIR against four officers (two EROs and two AEROs) and one data entry operator for their failure to perform their statutory duties and for violating data security policies by sharing log-in credentials with unauthorised persons.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk attempted to ""instigate"" Ladakh’s youth for protests inspired by regime-toppling movements in neighoburing Nepal and Bangladesh, the Centre and the Union territory administration said in the Supreme Court on Monday.Wangchuk was detained in September last year two days after deadly violence during pro-statehood protests in his native Ladakh. He is detained under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and has been lodged in a prison in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.The NSA empowers the Centre and states to detain individuals to prevent them from acting in a manner ""prejudicial to the defence of India"". The maximum detention period is 12 months, although it can be revoked earlier.The Supreme Court is currently hearing a writ petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife, social entrepreneur Gitanjali J Angmo, challenging his detention.“Wangchuk carefully crafted his speeches to mobilise Gen Z, urging agitations similar to those in Nepal and Bangladesh, while invoking Mahatma Gandhi’s speeches to mask his true intentions. He also referenced ‘Arab Spring’-style movements that led to the overthrow of multiple governments in the Arab world,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PV Varale.Mehta further alleged that the former educationist sought to create a rift between the central government and the people of Ladakh by framing the government as “them” and the people as “us.” He also claimed Wangchuk called for a “plebiscite” and “referendum.""“There is no ‘them’ or ‘us’—we are all Indians. Ladakh shares borders with China and Pakistan, making it a very fragile region. His speeches must be considered in their entirety. He was allegedly misleading young people while selectively invoking Mahatma Gandhi, who never incited people against their own government,” the SG told the bench.Mehta argued that the district magistrate of Leh—the Union Territory capital where violence erupted on September 24, 2025—had carefully reviewed relevant materials, including videos of Wangchuk’s speeches, before issuing the preventive detention order. “It took four hours for the detention order to be executed. After the district magistrate passed it, a DIG-rank officer briefed him and showed him videos of Wangchuk’s speeches, explaining the grounds for detention,” the SG noted.Addressing the petitioner's contention that the district magistrate relied on “borrowed material,” Mehta maintained that this argument is flawed. “The district magistrate is not required to witness every speech firsthand. Officials who heard the speeches recorded videos and submitted them as evidence. Based on these materials, the order was passed,” he contended.The arguments remained inconclusive and are set to continue on Tuesday.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk was detained in September last year.

'What happened to 56-inch chest when China was standing against us?'

Why the uproar?

What BJP said?

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""ran away"" from making decisions, adding the Centre was ""scared"" of ex-Army chief MM Naravane's perspective of the 2020 Galwan clash. Rahul was repeatedly denied permission to quote Naravane's unpublished memoir in Parliament, with Union home minister Amit Shah , defence minister Rajnath Singh strongly objecting to the reference.""The point here is exactly what the Prime Minister said and what Rajnath Singh Ji said. Whether the land was taken or not, that's a different question. We'll come to that. But before we come to that, the leader of the country is supposed to give direction. The leader of the country is not supposed to run away from decisions and leave decisions to other people's shoulders. That is what the Prime Minister has done,"" Rahul told reporters after the lower house was adjourned repeatedly amid uproar over his speech.""I am not being allowed to speak. I just have to speak 2-3 lines. It is a matter of national security. These are the words of the Army Chief (former), and it is a conversation that he has had with Rajnath Singh ji and PM Modi.All I am saying is that I want to say in the House what the Army Chief (former) has written and what orders did Rajnath Singh and PM Modi give him,"" he added.Continuing his attack on the central government, Rahul said that the Army was ""let down"" by the political leadership during the Galwan clash. Rahul said that the PM and the defence minister was scared of ""one line"" that is there in the memoir which he was being denied to say, claiming that he would say it in the Parliament.""They are scared of a line. There is one line in it that PM Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh are scared of. I will say that line inside Parliament, and no one will stop me,"" he said.Citing Naravane's memoir which remains unpublished, Rahul asked why the Centre was ""so scared what the Army Chief has to say?""""We will learn something from it. Of course, we will learn something about a Prime Minister. We will learn something about Rajnath Singh ji. But we will also learn something about the Army and how it was let down by the political leadership of the country. I'm saying that Naravane ji has clearly written about the Prime Minister and Rajnath Singh ji in his book,"" he said.""It has appeared in an article. I am quoting the article. They are not letting me speak... They are scared because if it comes out, the reality of Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh will be revealed to the people and what happened to the 56-inch chest when China was standing against us, advancing?"" he added.The uproar in Parliament was triggered when Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from the unpublished “memoir” of former Army chief Gen M M Naravane on the 2020 India-China conflict during the Motion of Thanks debate, drawing strong objections from defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP MPs, who accused him of “misleading the House.”Gandhi said he was responding to BJP MP Tejasvi Surya’s remarks questioning the Congress’ nationalism and began citing what he claimed were excerpts from Naravane’s memoir on the 2020 India-China border clash.Despite repeated warnings from Speaker Om Birla that unpublished material could not be quoted, Gandhi insisted the document was authenticated, triggering sustained protests from the treasury benches. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju accused Gandhi of violating House rules, following which the Speaker adjourned the House multiple times amid continued deadlock.The BJP dismissed Rahul's claims as ""misleading"" with Amit Malviya sharing several videos of the ex-Army chief speaking on the Galwan clash.""Not only of the PLA itself, but I feel it diminished the stature of China as a country in the global eyes. After this clash occurred and we showed that it is possible to stand up to China, who tries to bully its smaller neighbours. Once we did that, from Canada to Lithuanian to Europe to Phillipines everyone got that feeling that if you are fighting for what is correct, if you have a principled stand, it is possible to take a stand even against China. And we don't have to always be cowed down by might that they try to project,"" Naravane was heard saying in one interview.In another, he confirmed that India had not lost even an ""inch"" of its territory to China. ""Firstly, we haven't lost out on any territory. We are where we were before this whole thing started. As a result of this agreement, it has been reached on the principle of mutual and equal security. I think that should be the whole disengagement process. It serves the interests of both the countries to have agreed to a stable LAC without any confrontation taking place. That should be the larger view of the deal,"" he said.However, the videos shared by Malviya did not address Rahul's claim of PM running away from decision-making during the clash.","Gandhi was repeatedly denied permission to quote Naravane's unpublished memoir in Parliament.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

CHANDIGARH: Citing the ""emergence of new facts"", Punjab and Haryana high court has resumed hearing in the Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case, more than four months after reserving its verdict on the appeal filed by Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and others.""The appeals have been finally heard on Sept 25, 2025. However, while dictating the judgment, some new facts have emerged, which require further clarification for proper adjudication of the matter,"" a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Vikram Aggarwal observed in its order released on Jan 30 while starting re-hearing of the matter.On Jan 17, 2019, a special CBI court in Panchkula had sentenced the Dera chief and three others to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, editor of ‘Poora Sach' newspaper.The Dera chief challenged the conviction before HC, claiming that he had been falsely implicated by CBI as the first chargesheet against other accused, Nirmal, Kuldeep and Krishan Lal, had already been filed and none of them had alleged his involvement in the conspiracy.Counsel for Gurmeet Ram Rahim contended that he was not named in the first chargesheet filed by police in 2002 and that his name was included in it ""by way of revenge"".""The investigating agency failed to prove that the appellant ever read the said newspaper (‘Poora Sach').

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to deploy her own police personnel to safeguard families of the SIR victims during her visit to the national capital, sparking a tense standoff with Delhi Police On Monday evening, it was confirmed that a 25-member Bengal Police team, led by a deputy SP and an inspector and including a RAF unit, would be dispatched immediately to Delhi to protect around 100 SIR-affected families.The team is scheduled to reach the city today.Delhi Police special commissioner Devesh Chandra Srivastava clarified that Banerjee has been accorded Z+ security in Delhi, and the responsibility for her security rests with the Delhi Police as per protocol.He said, “Adequate deployments were made at Banga Bhavan, Hailey Road, and various guest houses where VVIPs and senior leaders were staying. At no point did police enter Banga Bhavan or restrict movement of its occupants.”The tensions escalated Monday morning when news spread that barricades had been set up outside one of the two West Bengal guest houses in Delhi. TMC MPs, joined by CM Banerjee and national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, reached the locations.Addressing the media, the CM said, “As many as 150 people have died during the Bengal SIR. Some of their relatives are here. Why can’t they speak with the media? Wherever these people have been put up, the Union government has sent cops. ”Criticizing the Delhi Police and the central leadership, Banerjee added, “I won’t blame the cops, I will blame the one on top. He cannot provide security to the country.” She accused officers of “torturing and harassing” the affected families and claimed that police were “searching rooms and threatening people.”A Delhi cop attempted to explain the deployment was for security purposes, but Banerjee interrupted, saying, “What security are you speaking of? You are coming to Banga Bhawan, which belongs to us, to threaten our people.” She emphasized the symbolic nature of her protest, noting that only about 50 victims’ relatives were present.Delhi Police maintained that no personnel entered Banga Bhawan, adding that the deployment was precautionary due to reports that 150-200 party supporters and senior leaders were staying in guest houses across Delhi.The CM’s stand sparked a political stir in Parliament, with TMC MPs storming the Lok Sabha well and raising slogans against the Union government, joined by Samajwadi Party members. In Rajya Sabha, TMC MP Sagarika Ghose also raised the issue.Banerjee concluded sharply, “Amit Shah gets a red carpet in Bengal, but when I come here, I get a black carpet. If no one else fights, I will,” accusing the central government of making Delhi “a zamindari” with no space for the poor.",West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to deploy her own police personnel to safeguard families of the SIR victims during her visit to the national capital.

BENGALURU: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara Monday alleged governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot has referred Hate Speech and Hate Crime (Prevention) Bill to President Droupadi Murmu, which he said was a deliberate bid to “dump it in cold storage”.The bill, passed by both Houses during the winter session in Belagavi, was sent to Gehlot in Dec. Parameshwara told reporters that the governor has questioned 28 points in the bill. “If the President sends it back to us with her observations, then we will do something and send it again (for gubernatorial assent),” he said. He said the bill was brought consciously and defended it as a necessary safeguard. “We have freedom of speech, but that does not mean that one can say anything. We have to see how it impacts our society. Hence, the bill was introduced,” he said. He said there were instances of hate speech that made govt think of bringing a law.Targeting BJP, Parameshwara said, “If you still say that this is not proper, then what are your motives? Should it mean that anyone can abuse anyone? Should we allow any disturbance in society?”He alleged the governor did not want the bill to become a law. “In my opinion, the Governor has intentionally referred it to the President, so that it does not come into effect.He wants it to be shelved forever,” Parameshwara said. Asked about similar developments in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, he said, “Let’s see what happens in the coming days. I think things will improve.”BJP state chief Vijayendra said the Congress govt brought the bill with the sole intention of suppressing the opposition and curbing democratic voices in the state. He criticised the way the legislation was cleared during the Belagavi session, alleging it was rushed through.“This bill is dangerous to the democratic system. In Tarikere (Chikkamagaluru district), Vikas Puttur, a Hindu activist, had not even begun his speech; police officials went there and served him a notice, threatening to arrest him if he spoke,” Vijayendra said.On the governor not giving assent, Vijayendra said, “The proposed legislation itself was flawed and aimed at silencing the opposition.”",Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara alleged governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot has referred Hate Speech and Hate Crime (Prevention) Bill to President Droupadi Murmu.

Multiple earthquakes shook the region early Monday

some minor incidents

Why this happened: normal Bay Area seismic activity

It wasa shaky start to Super Bowl week in the San Francisco Bay Area on Monday morning. A series of earthquakes rattled the region, including a **magnitude 4.2 tremor just as fans, teams, and media were starting to arrive ahead of Super Bowl LX festivities. Thankfully, there are no reports of major damage or serious injuries but residents and transit authorities definitely felt it.The United States Geological Survey recorded multiple earthquakes near San Ramon, California, early Monday. The largest was measured at magnitude 4.2 around 7:01 a.m., and dozens of smaller quakes occurred before and after it in roughly a 90-minute span.Seismic activity ranged from around 2.5 up to 4.2 magnitude with the earliest noticeable tremors starting around 6:27 a.m. before the strongest hit. Locals reported feeling shaking in areas as far as Oakland, Richmond, San Leandro and eastern parts of San Francisco.The quakes happened at the very start of a massive week in the Bay Area. With Super Bowl LX scheduled for Sunday at Levi’s Stadium, thousands of fans, media and NFL personnel are already in the region for events and festivities and many felt the shaking.Despite the timing, there’s no indication these earthquakes have affected official Super Bowl operations or event schedules so far.While there have beenlike items falling off store shelves but no serious damage or injuries have been reported from the quake swarm.Local transit officials, including Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), slowed trains temporarily to conduct track safety inspections after the tremors. Riders were warned to expect delays of up to 20 minutes systemwide while crews checked infrastructure.The Bay Area sits on a tangle of active fault lines, including the Calaveras Fault and earthquake swarms aren’t unusual for the region. Experts say clusters of smaller quakes often occur without indicating a major quake is imminent.This particular swarm fits a pattern, San Ramon and the broader East Bay have seen frequent small tremors in recent months. Scientists note this kind of activity tends to happen in sequences and is part of the area’s ongoing seismicity.For locals, the shaking was a noticeable Monday morning jolt and for visitors here for Super Bowl week, it was an unexpected experience. But so far, everything from transit systems to event plans remains operational and intact.If anything, the earthquake activity serves as a reminder that being in the Bay Area means living with seismic risk even during one of the biggest sports weeks of the year.","The United States Geological Survey recorded multiple earthquakes near San Ramon, California, early Monday.

MUMBAI: Parth Pawar, the elder son of late NCP leader Ajit Pawar , was overcome with emotion during ceremonial prayers held at the party office on Sunday, where his father’s ashes were brought for rituals. Visibly distressed, Parth was seen holding and hugging Ajit Pawar’s empty chair, breaking down as he paid tribute to his father.The emotional scene unfolded during the prayer ceremony organised after Ajit Pawar, who died in a plane crash in Baramati on January 28, was remembered by party leaders and workers at the NCP office.Meanwhile, NCP Maharashtra president and Lok Sabha MP Sunil Tatkare said the ashes of Ajit Pawar would be taken to all districts of the state to allow people to pay their respects. After the public homage, the ashes would be immersed locally, he added.Tatkare also asserted that the NCP would continue to remain part of the BJP-led NDA and move forward on the ideology and path laid down by the late Ajit Pawar.Addressing speculation over merger talks, Tatkare questioned the timing of such discussions, asking why they were being raised even before Ajit Pawar’s last rites had been completed. He said he had not made any comments on the issue but a narrative was being created suggesting otherwise.Tatkare further said the NCP joined the NDA while remaining committed to its secular ideology and the principles of social justice inspired by Shivaji Maharaj, Jyotiba Phule, Shahu Maharaj and B R Ambedkar, adding that the decision carried the mandate of the people of Maharashtra.","Parth Pawar was seen holding and hugging Ajit Pawar’s empty chair, breaking down as he paid tribute to his father.

Mumbai BMC mayoral election: BJP corporators frontrunners for jt group leader; Sena insists on 1.25-yr mayorship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-mayoral-election-bjp-corporators-frontrunners-for-jt-group-leader-sena-insists-on-1-25-yr-mayorship/articleshow/127853760.cms,"“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm





MUMBAI: With the BJP and Shiv Sena set to register their groups for the BMC on Monday, BJP corporators Ganesh Khankar and Prabhakar Shinde have emerged as frontrunners for the post of group leaders. Sena functionaries said the two parties are likely to register a joint MahaYuti group if the BJP agrees to its power-sharing formula and assures it of the Mayor’s post for at least 1.25 years, if not a full 2.5-year term.Khankar is an old BJP hand and a corporator from Borivli, while Shinde is a senior BJP corporator from Mulund. Shinde was in the Sena before and joined the BJP in 2017, and was also the BJP’s group leader when the BMC’s term ended in 2022.He was also a member of the Standing Committee.If Khankar becomes the BJP’s group leader, he will be the leader of the house as the BJP is the single-largest party. In this case, Shinde will be afrontrunner to become Chairperson of the all-important Standing Committee. While the group leader’s post is for a period of 5 years, unless the appointee is changed by the party, the term of the Standing Committee Chairperson is only 1 year, and elections for the Chairperson take place every year.“The party wants to nominate an original BJP man as the group leader. Plus, the nominee has to be Marathi. So, Khankar fits this bill. Prabhakar Shinde, on the other hand, is from the Sena originally but a very experienced hand, so he will be more suitable to handle the Standing Committee,” said a senior BJP functionary. Functionaries said a power-sharing formula between the two parties was finalised, and while the BJP will head the joint group with its group leader, the whip of the group of 118 corporators will be from the Sena. So, even though the Sena loses one group leader’s post, they will still have control of the joint group through a Sena whip.Similarly, the BJP is likely to keep the Mayor’s post and Standing Committee Chairperson’s post, while the Sena is likely get the Chairperson of the Improvements, Health and BEST Committee, and the Deputy Mayor’s post. Sena corporator Amey Ghole is likely to be the Sena’s whip.While a final call on the joint registration will be made between CM Devendra Fadnavis and DCM Eknath Shinde, functionaries said the path for a joint group registration was largely cleared.",BJP corporators Ganesh Khankar and Prabhakar Shinde have emerged as frontrunners for the post of group leaders.

'Trump's Domestic Army On The Loose': Bernie Sanders Pushes To Shift ICE's $75 Bn To Medicaid





A federal judge on Saturday ordered the release of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, from a Texas detention centre by Tuesday, sharply criticising the Trump administration’s immigration policies. The ruling came after the pair were detained by immigration officers in Minnesota on January 20 and moved to a facility in Dilley, Texas.Images of Liam wearing a bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack surrounded by ICE officers drew national attention and outrage. US District Judge Fred Biery, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said the case reflected “the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children.”Neighbors and school officials claimed immigration officers used Liam to lure his mother to the door, though the Department of Homeland Security denied this. Arias entered the US illegally from Ecuador in December 2024, but his lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim.Biery referenced the Declaration of Independence and Bible verses in his ruling, including “Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me…’” and “Jesus wept.” He highlighted the trauma caused to children and families under the current enforcement approach.","5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father were detained by immigration officers in Minnesota on January 20.

"Celebrity doctor Peter Attia breaks silence over crude email sent to Epstein: I had little exposure, his access felt novel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/celebrity-doctor-peter-attia-breaks-silence-over-crude-email-sent-to-epstein-i-had-little-exposure-his-access-felt-novel/articleshow/127867257.cms,"



Celebrity doctor and anti-aging physician Peter Attia, who is also a contributor to CBS News, broke his silence about the crude email that he sent to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, released in the latest tranche of files drop. The Canadian-American author, researcher did not deny the crude email but said he was not involved in any criminal activity, was never on his plane and his infamous private island. Attia said he was never present at any sex party but is embarassed of the tasteless, indefensible emails that he wrote to Epstein.The email from him was sent to Epstein after his conviction.""In June 2015, I sent Epstein an email with the subject line 'Got a fresh shipment'. The email contained a photograph of bottles of metformin, a medication I had just received from the pharmacy for my own use. The subject line referred to the picture of the bottles of medication. He replied with the words “me too” and attached a photograph of an adult woman. I responded with crude, tasteless banter. Reading that exchange now is very embarrassing, and I will not defend it. I’m ashamed of myself for everything about this. At the time, I understood this exchange as juvenile, not a reference to anything dark or harmful.""Attia said that at that point in his career, he had little exposure to prominent people and Epstein's access felt novel. ""Everything about him seemed excessive and exclusive, including the fact that he lived in the largest home in all of Manhattan, owned a Boeing 727, and hosted parties with the most powerful and prominent leaders in business and politics. I treated that access as something to be quiet about rather than discussed freely with others. ""Attia said he was never Epstein's doctor but he answered general medical questions and recommended other providers to him. Attia said he was repulsed when he learned about the investigation against Epstein in 2018. ""At that point, I told him directly he needed to accept responsibility for what he did,"" he wrote.Attia was mentioned in the Epstein Files 1741 times and the most outrageous was the email that he himself mentioned in his statement where he said female genitals could be counted as ""low carb"".Attia's fans were heartbroken as the emails were made public. They matched one particular timeline with what he wrote in his book. In his book Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity, Attia wrote about a particular incident that took place on July 11, 2017. His wife Jill called him and informed him that their son suddenly stopped breathing. “When Jill called me from the ambulance, I was in New York, in a taxi on Fifty-Fourth Street, on my way to dinner,” Attia wrote. “After she finished telling me the story, I just said, without a shred of emotion, ‘Okay, call me when you get to the hospital, so I can talk to the doctors in the ICU.’”In his book, he elaborated that he stayed in New York because he had some important work, while his son had a cardiac arrest.An email exchange on July 12, 2017, shows Attia was planning to meet Epstein the next morning.In his statement, Attia, however, did not address this particular event as he apologized for his overall association with Epstein.","Peter Attia said he was never present at any sex party but is embarassed of the tasteless, indefensible emails that he wrote to Epstein.

Piers Morgan slams Candace Owens and Bassem Youssef over Erika Kirk remarks







The online fight around Charlie Kirk took a sharp turn after Piers Morgan publicly called out comments made on Candace Owens’ podcast. Morgan said it was wrong to joke about Erika Kirk. The backlash started after Bassem Youssef appeared on Owens’ show on January 29. During their talk, they discussed a leaked Zoom call involving Erika Kirk and Turning Point USA staff. Candace Owens questioned Erika Kirk’s behavior during that call, focusing on her facial expressions and tone.Soon after, a short clip from the podcast went viral. In that clip, Youssef made a remark that many viewers felt crossed a line. Piers Morgan reacted strongly, saying humor should never target a woman already facing public pressure. His comments added fuel to an already heated debate that had moved far beyond facts and into speculation.After the clip spread on X, Piers Morgan responded directly to Youssef. He wrote, “Why do you find it so funny to mock a young widow who has been dragged into public attacks? It is disgusting.” Morgan has repeatedly said that claims about Charlie Kirk are not supported by verified evidence.Youssef fired back at Morgan online. He questioned the credibility of official explanations and accused public figures of pretending to care while ignoring what he called unanswered questions.In his reply, Youssef criticized how grief is judged in public and suggested people do not trust investigations, though he provided no new proof.Earlier on the podcast, Youssef also mocked how Erika Kirk’s grief was discussed online, making comments that many listeners felt were cruel rather than funny. Candace Owens did not directly push back during that moment. Instead, the conversation moved to other topics, including Israel and media power.Piers Morgan has challenged Candace Owens on similar claims before on Piers Morgan Uncensored. He has praised her debating skills but said he believes she promotes unverified theories for attention and money. In January, Morgan also hosted Jeremy Boreing, who criticized Owens for targeting former allies and chasing clicks.In December, Morgan invited Owens back on his show and made a clear offer. If her claims were proven true, he would publicly praise her work. If not, he said she should openly admit she was wrong. That challenge still stands, as no verified evidence has backed the claims discussed on her podcast.",Piers Morgan publicly called out comments made on Candace Owens' podcast.
