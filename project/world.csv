'INDIA WON'T BUY RUSSIAN OIL': Trump's Huge Claim, Calls PM Modi His Friend | WATCH

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being ""frightened"" of Donald Trump , hours after the US President claimed that the PM has ""assured him that India would stop buying Russian oil"".The Congress leader said the Prime Minister ""keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs"".""PM Modi is frightened of Trump. 1. Allows Trump to decide and announce that India will not buy Russian oil. 2. Keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs. 3. Cancelled the Finance Minister’s visit to America. 4. Skipped Sharm el-Sheikh. 5. Doesn’t contradict him on Operation Sindoor,"" Rahul Gandhi wrote on X.Earlier, his party attacked PM Modi for ""compromising the country's dignity"", calling Russia India's close ally.""Don’t damage the country's relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties,"" said Congress."" Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican leader added.Meanwhile, Russia remains India's single-largest source of oil, accounting for 34% of inbound shipments in September, although volumes have slipped 10% in the first eight months of 2025, according to commodities and shipping markets tracker Kpler.The agency’s latest report pegs India’s crude imports in September at more than 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day).This is an increase of 70,000 barrels over August but flat when compared to the year-ago period, says the report, adding Russian oil accounted for a tad under 1.6 million bpd, or 34% of crude imports. India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Iran Blasts ‘Hypocrite’ Trump; Says He Can’t Be ‘President Of War & Peace’ At Same Time





NEW DELHI: In a striking echo of his predecessor, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday made an embarrassing gaffe as he confused India with Iran. Twice.While repeating his rant about negotiating a ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad, he referred to India as Iran, calling it a nuclear nation.Trump claimed he threatened both nations with 200% tariffs if the conflict blew up into a full-fledged war.""If you look at Pakistan and Iran -- I told them I was in the midst of negotiating a trade deal with Iran and Pakistan, and because of tariffs, they wanted to negotiate much differently. I heard they were shooting at each other, and then I said during one of my conversations, ""Are you guys going to go to war?” I said, 'Here’s a deal — you go to war, and I gotta put a 200% tariff and stop you from doing any business in the United States'. I said this to both of them, and within 24 hours, the war ended. That would have been a nuclear war .""Trump continues to blow a ""ceasefire"" trumpet despite India rejecting his claims and PM Modi firmly stating in Parliament that no global leader asked India to stop the attack.Sharing new details about India's Operation Sindoor in Lok Sabha, PM Modi said that US Vice President JD Vance had called him on May 9, to inform him about a 'huge' impending strike by Pakistan.""On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back. The Vice President of America told me on the phone that Pakistan is going to launch a big attack. My answer was that if Pakistan has this intention, it will cost them a lot. If Pakistan attacks, we will respond by launching a big attack. This was my answer,"" PM Modi told the Lower House.He further said that no leader anywhere in the world had asked India to stop its response, saying, “no global leader urged India to halt the operation.”“Operation Sindoor has not been called off yet and Pakistan remains on notice,” Modi said, adding that the neighbour's nuclear bluff has been called and India would not succumb to nuclear blackmail.","US President Donald Trump made an embarrassing gaffe as he confused India with Iran.

Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged

Poll Should countries take stronger action to secure their borders against militant attacks? Yes, strict security is necessary No, dialogue and diplomacy are better





Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged.

What are the charges?









Indian-origin US expert, Ashley Tellis, who has been an advisor to US government for more than two decades, was arrested on charges of unlawfully retaining classified information and allegedly meeting with Chinese officials.Tellis was found to have kept over 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, the affidavit stated.In April 2023, Tellis attended a dinner with Chinese government officials in a Washington DC suburb and “could be occasionally overheard talking about Iranian-Chinese relations and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence,” the affidavit noted.According to the affidavit, Tellis serves as an unpaid adviser at the State Department and is a contractor with the Office of Net Assessment (ONA). ONA is the Pentagon’s in-house think tank for anticipating security threats, which the Defence Department announced in March would be dismantled and “restructured.”Tellis reportedly met multiple times with Chinese government officials at a restaurant in the Washington suburb of Fairfax, Virginia. According to the FBI affidavit, cited by AFP, at one dinner he arrived carrying a manila envelope, which he did not appear to take back with him.On two other occasions, the Chinese officials reportedly presented him with gift bags.Additionally, late on the evening of September 25, Tellis entered the State Department, where he served as an unpaid adviser, and was seen printing from a classified document detailing US Air Force techniques, according to the affidavit.State Department confirmed that Tellis was arrested on Saturday—the same day the affidavit indicated he was scheduled to fly to Rome—but declined to provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation.Lindsey Halligan, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, announced that Tellis was charged by criminal complaint with the unlawful retention of national defense information, in violation of 18 USC § 793(e).“We are fully focused on protecting the American people from all threats, foreign and domestic. The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said US Attorney Halligan.“The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.”If convicted, Tellis is subject to a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment, up to a $250,000 fine, a $100 special assessment and forfeiture. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.","Indian-origin US expert, Ashley Tellis, was arrested on charges of unlawfully retaining classified information.

Embarrassment for his workers: JD(U)

'His tyre has already been flattened': RJD



Kishor bows out — 'in larger interest'



NEW DELHI: In Bihar’s charged political arena, the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” seemed to come alive on Wednesday, as rivals —BJP-JD(U) and RJD —found common ground in Prashant Kishor . The trio united in criticism of Jan Suraaj Party founder while mocking him for deciding to eventually not contest the upcoming assembly elections.Union minister Giriraj Singh was even more scathing, calling Kishor’s expectations of winning over 150 seats “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne” — a reference to a popular television show about daydreams. “Kishor realised he would not win. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ outfit — the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Singh said.Echoing that sentiment, BJP spokesperson Niraj Kumar said, “Kishor’s bubble burst even before the elections. By announcing that he won’t contest, he has admitted defeat for himself and his party.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar called the move “a humiliation for his workers,” accusing Kishor of having “run away before the electoral battle.”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Kishor’s withdrawal was “a business decision,” adding, “Prashant Kishor is a very smart businessman and has a lot of experience in election campaigns. Perhaps he realised that the ground situation is not in his favour and that if he loses, his enterprise will lose credibility.”JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar called Kishor’s withdrawal a “humiliation” for his own party workers, accusing him of abandoning ship before the real fight began. “He has run away before the electoral battle,” Kumar said.“Earlier, he claimed to have undertaken padayatras to understand the people's issues. What happened to that? His decision is sheer embarrassment for his workers,” he added.RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary also mocked Kishor saying he had “accepted defeat before the battle began.” “Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls,” Tiwary remarked.“Kishor must understand that politics is not as easy as offering consultancy to others. His tyre has already been flattened.”Prashant Kishor, once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken “in the larger interest” of his Jan Suraaj Party. In an interview with PTI, Kishor said a tally of “less than 150 seats” would be considered a defeat for his party, but insisted that “if Jan Suraaj wins, it will change national politics.”He explained that his decision was meant to keep the focus on party-building rather than personal ambition. “If I were to contest, it would have distracted me from the necessary organisational work,” said Kishor, who was earlier expected to contest from Raghopur, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s constituency.","BJP-JD(U) and RJD find common ground in Prashant Kishor.

If I have said anything wrong, I ask her to forgive me. I will render countless obeisance at her feet. But I ask her to help my daughter get justice,"" the victim’s father told TV channels, according to PTI.""I have been demanding a CBI probe into this case. I think that would be good. But that depends on the state administration as well,"" he added.His remarks come days after he criticised the chief minister for her comment that ""women should not venture out at night,"" following the assault of his daughter, a second-year MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur.Earlier on Monday, the survivor's father stated that, ""She (Mamata Banerjee) is also a woman. How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety. ""I want to take my daughter back to Odisha. Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me.

What allegedly prompted Mahendra Reddy to murder his wife?





BENGALURU: A city-based surgeon has been charged with murdering his newlywed wife, a dermatologist, by allegedly administering repeated overdoses of anaesthesia under the pretext of treatment.Though the alleged murder took place in April this year, police arrested the accused doctor on Tuesday, after forensic science laboratory (FSL) reports confirmed the presence of anaesthesia in the viscera samples of the deceased woman.Marathahalli police from the Whitefield division announced Wednesday the arrest of Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, 31, a surgical resident at the Institute of Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplant (IGOT), on the premises of Victoria Hospital.Read also: 'Anaesthesia of death’: How Bengaluru doctor’s 'cure' became a crime; killed dermatologist wife in cold blood He is accused of murdering his wife, Kritika M Reddy, 28, whom he had married in March 2024.Announcing the arrest, city police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh stated that FSL reports confirmed the presence of Propofol, an intravenous anaesthetic used to induce and maintain unconsciousness for surgery, procedural sedation, or intensive care sedation.“Soon after Kritika Reddy’s death, we had registered a case of unnatural death.Now, her father, based on the FSL report, has filed a fresh complaint accusing his son-in-law of administering an overdose of anaesthesia and killing the victim,” Singh said.Police investigations revealed that Mahendra Reddy had shifted Kritika to Cauvery Hospital in Marathahalli on April 24, claiming she had fallen unconscious at their Munnekolal residence in Whitefield.However, doctors declared her brought dead. Since the doctors issued a death memo, an autopsy became imperative. Mahendra Reddy reportedly argued extensively with the Cauvery Hospital doctors and police, asking them to refrain from carrying out the autopsy.He also persuaded his father-in-law, K Muni Reddy, to request the police not to perform it. “I cannot think of doctors cutting my daughter’s body into pieces and examining it. Please don't do it,” Muni Reddy repeatedly told the authorities.Additional Commissioner of Police, East Division, Ramesh Banoth, said that despite the requests and objections from the father and husband, the body was subjected to an autopsy.“It was mandatory since a death memo had been issued. Meanwhile, the Scene of Crime Officer’s (SOCO) team visited the residence and collected all evidence, including medical materials such as injections and liquids used in treating the victim.According to the doctor husband, his wife had long-standing gastrointestinal (GI) issues, which he was treating,” Banoth said.After the post-mortem, Kritika’s body was handed over to her family. The ‘Reason for death’ column in the autopsy report was left blank, pending the FSL report.However, the FSL report, received by police on Tuesday, changed the course of the case from an unnatural death to a cold-blooded murder.Investigators traced Mahendra Reddy to Manipal in Udupi district and detained him. According to police sources, Reddy was attending a conference at the time.“Accused has taken a defensive stand, stating that he had treated his wife for gastrointestinal issues and that administering anaesthesia was part of it. However, he has no explanation for the overdose,” an investigating officer said.Police sources said Kritika’s long-term ill health disturbed Mahendra.“Soon after the marriage, Mahendra Reddy discovered that Kritika had multiple health issues, including low blood pressure and gastrointestinal problems. He was angry with Kritika’s parents for allegedly hiding this information before the marriage. This could be one of the reasons,” an officer said.Meanwhile, Muni Reddy’s complaint to Marathahalli police states that Mahendra Reddy often demanded money from Kritika.“He wanted me to build a private hospital for Kritika, and I refused, stating I did not have that much money. Meanwhile, Mahendra was ignoring my daughter while growing close to another woman. He treated her gastrointestinal issues by administering liquids intravenously. After her death, Mahendra and his family objected to the autopsy. However, my elder daughter Nikita, also a doctor, insisted on it. Based on her insistence, an unnatural death report was registered. Now, the FSL report confirms the presence of anaesthesia in her viscera samples. I seek legal action against Mahendra for murdering my daughter,” Muni Reddy’s complaint read.","Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, 31, a surgical resident at the Institute of Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplant (IGOT), was arrested on Tuesday.

""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican chief added.Trump made the remarks during a joint news conference with FBI director Kash Patel at the Oval Office.The US President also criticised India's previous oil imports from Russia and said: ""We were not happy with him buying oil from Russia, because that lets Russia continue on with this ridiculous war, where they've lost a million and a half people, by the way.Russia has lost a million and a half people, soldiers mostly.""He called the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict unnecessary, sayin, ""This is a war that should have never started, but it's a war that Russia should have won in the first week, and they're going into the fourth year.""""And I want to see it stop. So I was not happy that India was buying oil,"" Trump added.On being asked about the recent meeting between PM Modi and US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor, Trump said they were ""great"" and hailed PM Modi’s persistent leadership.""I think they were great. Modi is a great man. He (Sergio Gor) told me that he (PM Modi) loves Trump.I have watched India for years. It's an incredible country and every single year you would have a new leader.

"Who is Sahil Majothi? Indian student ‘framed’ by Russia into joining war, now in Ukrainian custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-sahil-majothi-indian-student-framed-by-russia-into-joining-war-now-in-ukrainian-custody/articleshow/124582645.cms,"(Source: X)

How Russia tricked Majothi into joining military



A complicated situation of do or die



Fate of Majothi and many Indians remains uncertain







A 22-year-old Indian student from Gujarat, Sahil Majothi, has become the first known Indian national to be detained in the Ukraine war after he was reportedly forced into fighting for Russia to avoid a prison sentence.Majothi was captured by Ukrainian forces and featured in a viral video posted by Ukraine’s 63rd Mechanized Brigade, where he explained his situation.Majothi told the Ukrainian troops that he joined the Russian army after being allegedly framed in a drug case in April 2024. “I didn't want to stay in prison, so I signed a contract for the 'special military operation'. But I wanted to get out of there,” he said in the video.Sahil's mother, Hasina Majothi, told BBC News that her son moved to Russia in January 2024, completed a language course in St. Petersburg, and later relocated to Moscow for college. While studying, he also worked as a kitchenware courier part-time job.In April, Hasina claims someone slipped drugs into a package he was delivering. “The police caught him with it and charged him,” she said. He was arrested and sentenced to seven years in a Russian prison.Majothi explained that he was given a choice: fight for Russia or remain in jail. He received promises of payment ranging from 100,000 to over a million roubles but never received any money. After just 15 days of basic training in September 2024, he was deployed to the war zone. On 1 October, just one day after his first combat mission, he had an altercation with his commander and decided to surrender to Ukrainian forces. “I came across a Ukrainian trench position about 2-3 kilometres away. I immediately put down my rifle and said that I didn't want to fight. I needed help,” he said. Majothi added, “I don't want to go back to Russia. There is no truth there, nothing. I'd rather go to prison here.”In September, the MEA had raised concerns over the recruitment of Indian nationals into the Russian army, warning of the risks and dangers involved. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the government had contacted Russian authorities in Delhi and Moscow to halt the practice and secure the release of Indian citizens.This case follows reports of two other Indian men allegedly misled to Russia under the pretext of construction jobs and then deployed on the frontlines. Families from Haryana claimed their relatives were forced into military service with minimal training, losing phone access, and facing life-threatening conditions.Majothi’s detainment has prompted Gujarat’s Anti-Terrorism Squad to question his family. His mother appealed to authorities, saying, “We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work.” Majothi remains in Ukrainian custody, hoping for a resolution that will allow him to return safely to India.","Sahil Majothi, 22, is the first known Indian national to be detained in the Ukraine war after he was reportedly forced into fighting for Russia to avoid a prison sentence.

BENGALURU: A day after Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw highlighted Bengaluru’s “creaking” infrastructure, Karnataka’s deputy CM D K Shivakumar Wednesday accused her of “betrayal” and of tarnishing the very state and country that helped her succeed as an entrepreneur.However, people sprang to her defence, accusing the government of displaying hostility towards those who speak up, and of refusing to accept constructive criticism.On her part, Shaw on Wednesday blamed previous governments’ inaction for the current situation. “We are in this situation because of past govts’ failure to act in time. This govt has the opportunity to change and act fast to fix these decades of deteriorating infrastructure. Govt ministers need to hold the GBA (Greater Bengaluru Authority) accountable for the shoddy and slow work. Here, the government and citizens need to be on the same page,” she wrote on X.Clarifying that her post was not political, Shaw said her demand was simply for basic civic maintenance. “All I am seeking is garbage clearance and road resurfacing which ought to be done by the GBA,” she said.Shivakumar, who holds the Bengaluru portfolio, has been leading the government’s defence along with senior Congress ministers by putting out what appear to be coordinated posts castigating Shaw and insisting things are fine or are improving.Meanwhile, across social media, Bengaluru’s residents rallied behind Shaw. “It’s a classic deflection tactic. Don’t fall for it. Don’t apologise for raising the issues...,” posted Whitefield Rising (@WFRising), a prominent citizen group.“Ma’am, we stand with you,” wrote another user, Viky (@urstrulyvikass), adding, “It’s our fundamental right to ask or raise questions...

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump ’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco. Joining him is now Tesla CEO Elon Musk who recently said that “This is the only solution at this point”. The tech billionaire was responding to a local advocate T Wolf's post citing a March 2025 survey where 61% of voters strongly support federal intervention to deport illegal fentanyl traffickers, rising to 83% including those who somewhat agree.The quoted post references SFPD's seizure of over 90 kilos of fentanyl in the past year and approximately 4,300 overdose deaths since 2020, aligning with official data showing 3,367 confirmed unintentional drug overdose fatalities from 2020 to 2024, with 2025 figures ongoing.“Pretty much 80% of San Francisco wants federal intervention on deporting drug dealers. That's how insane it's been here. 90+ kilos of fentanyl seized in one year by SFPD. 4,300 OD deaths since 2020. Hard data doesn't lie,” T Wolf wrote in the post. In another post, Wolf said “It's simple. If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away. If you don't, you reap what you sow.Replying to the post, Elon Musk wrote “It’s the only solution at this point. Nothing else has or will work.”In an interview last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he supports former President Donald Trump’s proposal to send federal troops to San Francisco, a plan that city leaders have called unacceptable.Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and backed the idea of deploying troops to help reduce crime. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted him as saying.Trump had reportedly discussed sending federal troops to San Francisco during an Oval Office meeting in August, naming it among several Democratic-led cities he said had been “destroyed.” He added that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff also praised Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative to cut federal spending and voiced support for venture capitalist David Sacks, who chairs Trump’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democrats strongly criticized Benioff’s remarks.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to “honour” the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Indian-origin politician has previously stated that, if elected mayor, he would “arrest” Netanyahu should the Israeli leader visit the city.""I’ve said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs,"" Mamdani told Fox News’ ""The Story"" show on Wednesday.Anchor Martha MacCallum noted that the US is not a signatory to the ICC, which Mamdani acknowledged. He stressed, however, that “The ICC… has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin (over alleged war crimes in Ukraine). I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us. ”The Democratic candidate clarified that he would not create new legislation to arrest Netanyahu. “I can tell you that I’m going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so,” he added, responding to a question about whether the NYPD would allow him to arrest the Israeli leader.During his recent US visit, Netanyahu avoided flying over countries that are ICC signatories and could have arrested him in their airspace.Mamdani, 33, who would become New York’s first Muslim mayor if elected and is a vocal critic of Donald Trump, also declined to credit the US president for last week’s ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas. “To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to say. But if it proves to be lasting and durable, then that’s where you give credit,” he said.He also avoided commenting directly on whether Hamas would “lay down their arms” in Gaza, emphasizing that his focus is on justice, safety, and adherence to international law. “Anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, the Israeli military, anyone you could ask me about,” Mamdani remarked.The mayoral election in New York is scheduled for November 4.

Roads were seen with moving tanks as intense clashes continued between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with both sides claiming damage and casualties. This latest confrontation left 15 Afghan civilians dead, officials in Kabul told AFP on Wednesday.The fighting broke out overnight in Spin Boldak, a southern Afghan district.Ali Mohammad Haqmal, a local spokesman, confirmed the casualties to AFP, while Abdul Jan Barak, an official at Spin Boldak district hospital, verified that dozens had been injured.According to the Pakistan Army, its forces killed at least 15–20 Taliban fighters in the Spin Boldak area, stating that “the attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces.”Clashes started Tuesday in a remote northwestern border region, with Pakistani state media accusing Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked fire.” Pakistan responded by damaging Afghan tanks and military posts, according to GeoTV and two anonymous security officials.Sources said one Taliban tank was destroyed, forcing the attackers to flee. Pakistani forces also targeted another Taliban post and moving tank in the Kurram sector, leaving several bodies behind.Security officials added that a Taliban training facility was destroyed, and Pakistan’s military remains on high alert along its border.Afghanistan claimed it inflicted heavy losses on Pakistani forces, capturing several outposts, weapons, and tanks, and destroying most of their military installations.A video released by Afghanistan’s ministry showed Taliban forces driving a captured tank through the streets.This is the second clash along the long Afghanistan-Pakistan border this week. Although fighting paused on Sunday after appeals from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, all border crossings remain closed.Over the weekend, Kabul said it attacked several Pakistani military posts, killing 58 soldiers in retaliation for alleged violations of Afghan territory. Pakistan reported lower casualties, saying it lost 23 soldiers but killed more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists.”Tensions have been high since last week, when the Taliban government accused Pakistan of airstrikes in Kabul and an eastern market, which Pakistan denied.Pakistan has previously conducted strikes inside Afghanistan targeting hideouts of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan accuses Kabul of harboring the group, responsible for deadly attacks inside Pakistan. Afghanistan denies the charge, insisting its territory is not used against other countries.","Fighting broke out overnight in Spin Boldak, a southern Afghan district.

'Deliberate': At least one US strike on 'drug-carrying' boats targeted Colombians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deliberate-at-least-one-us-strike-on-drug-carrying-boats-targeted-colombians-report/articleshow/124593114.cms,"US strikes drug-smuggling boat off Venezuela coast (SOurce: X@PeteHegseth)





At least one of the recent US military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats targeted Colombian nationals aboard a vessel that had departed from Colombia, according to two individuals briefed by the Pentagon.Since September, the US has carried out at least five strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean, including the most recent on October 14. The third strike, on September 19, targeted the Colombians, as per the sources.“It was deliberate. Though the boat was suspected of carrying people affiliated with Colombian terrorist organisations, the Pentagon was unable to determine the identities of each individual before the strike,” they told CNN The disclosure comes even as US President Donald Trump publicly confirmed that he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela to curb illegal flows of migrants and drugs from Colombia's fellow South American nation. Of the targeted vessels, four had departed from Venezuela.“We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also,” Trump said during an Oval Office event on Wednesday.Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whose US visa was recently revoked, had previously suggested that those aboard the September 19 vessel were Colombians.“If the boat was sunk in the Dominican Republic, then it is possible that they were Colombians. This means that officials from the US and the Dominican Republic would be guilty of the murder of Colombian citizens,” Petro posted on X.After the fourth strike, on October 2, he again hinted, citing “indications,” that those victims were also Colombians. “The aggression is against all of Latin America and the Caribbean,” he added.White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN that every strike targeted “designated narco-terrorists bringing deadly poison to our shores.”“On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to take on the cartels – and he has taken unprecedented action to stop the scourge of narcoterrorism that has resulted in the needless deaths of innocent Americans,” Kelly noted, adding that the president “will continue to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice.”","Since September, the US has carried out at least five strikes on suspected drug- smuggling boats in the Caribbean.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) confirmed that he has authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct a ""covert operation"" in Venezuela, amid escalating tensions between the two countries.Trump made the rare admission during a Q&A session at the Oval Office after being asked about a New York Times report on the matter.“I authorised it for two reasons,” he said. “First, Venezuela emptied its prisons and mental institutions into the United States. They came through the border because of our open-border policy. Thousands of prisoners and mentally ill people entered the country—we’re sending them back. Many countries have done it, but not like Venezuela.

‘Proud dad of US Marine’ deported by ICE agents moments after visiting pregnant daughter at California military base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/proud-dad-of-us-marine-deported-by-ice-agents-moments-after-visiting-pregnant-daughter-at-california-military-base/articleshow/124590347.cms,"(Phoro: X)





A US Marine’s father was deported and his mother detained after both were arrested by federal immigration officials while visiting family at Camp Pendleton in California.Under the MAGA government, immigration enforcement is even affecting military families.Steve Rios, a Marine from Oceanside, said his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez, went to Camp Pendleton on September 28 to have breakfast with his pregnant sister, Ashley Rios, and her husband, who is also a Marine.The couple was stopped at the gate by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.“They were taken into custody and later released with ankle monitors,” Steve Rios said. “At a later check-in with federal immigration officials, they were detained again.”The arrested parents came to the United States from Mexico 30 years ago, reports NBC 7 San Diego.Esteban Rios was wearing a red shirt and a white hat reading “Proud dad of a U.S. Marine” when he was taken into custody, his son said. “He said, ‘Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we’ll be fine,’” Steve recalled. By October 10, Esteban had been deported, while his mother’s whereabouts remained unknown.Neither parent had a criminal record, and both had pending green card applications, which Steve Rios said he had sponsored.“It was scary because my whole life, it’s been in the back of my head,” he said. “They’ve worked tirelessly cleaning houses and cars all these years. It was just making them proud.”Ashley Rios, expecting her first child, said it was difficult not having her parents nearby. “I'd always want my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it’s just hard not to think about your parents there,” she said.An ICE spokesperson told NBC, “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.” The department added that it enforces laws against those who break them.The case is part of a broader push by the MAGA administration to enforce immigration laws more strictly, which has occasionally affected the families of military personnel and veterans. In recent months, other military families have also reported ICE detaining relatives despite pending legal status or ongoing parental duties, reports New York Post.Steve Rios remained uncertain about what will happen next. “They might get sent back. They might not. The only person that knows is up there,” he said.",A US Marine’s father was deported and his mother detained after both were arrested by federal immigration officials.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Israeli forces could return to Gaza on his command if Hamas compromises the ceasefire deal.Trump said that he could deploy the IDF “as soon as he says the word” if Hamas fails to follow through on the ceasefire agreement, reports CNN.“What’s going on with Hamas – that’ll be straightened out quickly,” Trump said in a brief telephone call. He was referring to accusations by Israel that Hamas has not fully complied with the agreement to hand over hostages, both living and deceased.The 20-point peace plan outlined by Trump stated, “Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.” As of Wednesday morning, all 20 living Israeli hostages had been released, while only four bodies had been returned. The Israeli military reported that one of the bodies did not belong to an Israeli hostage.“Getting those 20 hostages out was paramount,” Trump said.Violent clashes have continued in Gaza, including incidents of public executions, as Hamas confronts rival groups. Trump warned that Hamas must disarm, or “we will disarm them.” His peace plan also proposes that Hamas should have no role in governing Gaza, which would be demilitarised and monitored independently.Trump said, “I’m doing research on it,” when asked whether Hamas may be executing innocent Palestinians. “We’ll find out about it. It could be gangs plus.”When asked about the consequences if Hamas refuses to disarm, Trump said, “I think about it. Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap out of them, they’d do that.” He added that he had previously restrained the Israeli military. “I had to hold them back. I had it out with Bibi.”Trump hoped for long-term peace, noting strong international support. “Fifty-nine countries are part of this,” he said, referring to the summit in Egypt where countries signed or supported the principles of the “Trump Peace Agreement.”The MAGA leader also touched on other global issues, saying he continues to work on ending the Russian war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit the White House on Friday.“I’m working hard on the Russian thing,” Trump said. “One’s been going on for three years, the other three thousand.”","US President Donald Trump said that Israeli forces could return to Gaza on his command if Hamas compromises the ceasefire deal.

Clashes between neighbours Pakistan and Afghanistan continue, with fresh reports emerging early Wednesday from a remote northwestern region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. State-run media in Pakistan accused Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked firing” that was repulsed.Pakistani forces responded, reportedly damaging Afghan tanks and military posts, according to Pakistan TV and two security officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.“Afghan Taliban and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan opened unprovoked fire in Kurram. Pakistani Army responded with full force and intensity,” reported state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources on X.According to Dawn, Taliban regime posts suffered heavy damage and a tank caught fire after being hit, with Taliban fighters fleeing from their positions. A later report added: “Another post and tank position of the Afghan Taliban destroyed in Kurram sector.”Tahir Ahrar, a deputy police spokesperson in Afghanistan’s Khost province, confirmed the clashes but provided no further details.This marks the second time this week that both sides have exchanged fire along their long shared border.Pakistan’s state-run media reported that Afghan forces and Pakistani Taliban jointly opened fire at a Pakistani post “without provocation,” prompting what the media described as a “strong response” from Pakistani troops in Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Security officials also said Pakistan’s military destroyed a sprawling training facility of the Pakistani Taliban.There was no immediate comment from Pakistan’s military, which has been on high alert since Saturday when both sides traded fire across multiple border regions, resulting in dozens of casualties on each side.Although the clashes paused on Sunday after appeals from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, all border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain closed.Over the weekend, Kabul said it targeted several Pakistani military posts, killing 58 Pakistani soldiers in retaliation for what it called repeated violations of Afghan territory and airspace. Pakistan’s military reported lower figures, saying it lost 23 soldiers and killed more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” in retaliatory fire along the frontier.Tensions have remained high since last week, when the Taliban government accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes in Kabul and in an eastern market. Pakistan has not acknowledged those allegations.Pakistan has previously launched strikes inside Afghanistan, saying it targets hideouts of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a group separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan accuses Kabul of harbouring the group, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries.","State-run media in Pakistan accused Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked firing” that was repulsed.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown.The decision came as the shutdown entered its third week.US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the planned job cuts were being carried out without proper consideration. “It’s very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,” she said. ""It’s a human cost that cannot be tolerated.""Trump defended the actions, saying, “Programs favoured by Democrats are being targeted and they’re never going to come back, in many cases.”Judge Illston granted a temporary restraining order after labour unions argued that the administration’s layoff notices were illegal and designed to pressure Congress. The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions sought to block both new layoffs and those already issued, claiming the firings were an abuse of power aimed at punishing workers.The Trump administration had begun issuing notices last week to reduce the size of the federal workforce, affecting more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies. The moves targeted programmes in health, education, and special services while continuing payments to the military and pursuing immigration enforcement.Democratic lawmakers have insisted that any deal to reopen the government must address health care demands, including extending subsidies introduced in 2021 and reversing Medicaid cuts in Trump’s recent tax and spending bill. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the shutdown could become the longest in US history, adding he “won’t negotiate” until Democrats pause their demands.The administration argued in court that the temporary funding lapse does not eliminate Congress’ authorisation of agency programmes and that the court lacks jurisdiction over federal employment decisions.","US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the planned job cuts were being carried out without proper consideration. “It’s very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,” she said.

"Tellis tale isn't a tell-all; FBI affidavit charges him with unlawful retention of classified info, not espionage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tellis-tale-isnt-a-tell-all-fbi-affidavit-charges-him-with-unlawful-retention-of-classified-info-not-espionage/articleshow/124583333.cms,"Ashley Tellis

TOI correspondent from Washington:





The American think-tank community is in shock this week after the US justice department accused Ashley Tellis, a respected Indian-American scholar, of unlawful retention of national defense information and undocumented meetings with Chinese officials.Tellis, 64, a naturalized US citizen and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was charged via a criminal complaint filed Monday following an FBI search that allegedly uncovered over a thousand pages of documents marked TOP SECRET and SECRET stored in his home.The charging document - an affidavit filed by FBI special agent Jeffrey Scott - details how Tellis, who holds a top secret clearance with sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access, allegedly removed highly sensitive materials from secure government facilities.SCI access is a formal authorization for individuals to handle specific US classified information. Individuals with SCI access are often required to sign a lifelong nondisclosure agreement and are restricted to working within specific sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIFs).According to the affidavit, the FBI investigation began after video surveillance captured Tellis engaging in “concerning activity” at two separate secure facilities in September and October 2025.In one instance, the affidavit details repeated attempts by Tellis to print hundreds of pages of documents, including several classified SECRET/ NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals) pages concerning US air force tactics, techniques, and procedures and military aircraft capabilities. He also allegedly re-saved a file titled ""Econ reform"" that contained highly classified information before printing specific page ranges.The affidavit states that on October 11, 2025, a federal court authorized a search warrant for Tellis’s residence in Vienna, Virginia, the same day he was scheduled to depart for planned international travel to Rome, Italy.The affidavit also documents several meetings Tellis had with Chinese government officials between September 2022 and September 2025, raising questions about potential information compromise.In one instance, on September 15, 2022, surveillance allegedly observed Tellis entering the restaurant with a manila envelope and departing without it, while the PRC officials entered with a gift bag. In another instance, on September 2, 2025, the PRC officials reportedly handed Tellis a red gift bag near the end of the dinner.The conversations at these dinners, according to the affidavit, touched on sensitive topics like Iranian-Chinese relations, emerging technologies (AI), and US-Pakistan relations, all areas of expertise for Tellis.The charges against Tellis stunned members of the strategic affairs community, many of whom have had constructive engagements with a well-regarded scholar even when they have disagreed with him. Some analysts even went so far as to argue that meeting Chinese officials, as the justice department affidavit alleged, was par for course in the strategic thinkers community.“My good friend Ashley Tellis may have been careless with classified documents (though less than the current US president) but meeting with Chinese officials is part of his f**cking job,” Bruno Tertrais, a scholar with the French thinktank FRS, wrote on X.In the thinktank circuit, the broad consensus was Tellis may have erred in handling classified information, but calling him a Chinese spy – which the affidavit implies but does not say directly – would be a stretch. If anything, he had long been advising Washington and New Delhi that they need to work together to deal with a rising China.Mishandling classified or top secret documents is an old and familiar story in Washington DC. Among those accused of it more recently: Joe Biden, and before him, Donald Trump.After he demitted office in 2020, then former President Trump was charged in a federal criminal case with willful retention of national defense information and other charges related to storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence.Biden’s own personal attorneys discovered classified documents from his time as Vice President at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement and his private residence in Wilmington, Delaware. Former vice-president Mike Pence was also accused of taking away classified documents.While they were unscathed because of the privilege of high office, others like former national security advisor Sandy Berger and CIA chief general David Petraeus, had to face consequences.After he was accused of intentionally concealing and removing a classified report detailing the Clinton administration's internal assessments of the unsuccessful 2000 millennium attack plots, Berger pled guilty in 2005 to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to two years of probation with 100 hours of community service. His security clearance was revoked for three years and he was later disbarred from practicing law.In another case, former US general David Petraeus was charged with providing eight binders of classified material, which he called his ""black books,"" to Paula Broadwell, who was writing his biography, All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, and with whom he was allegedly in a relationship. The fallout from the affair and subsequent FBI investigation led to his resignation as CIA Director in November 2012. He was later sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.In yet another case, former assistant secretary of state Robin Raphel was also accused of being in possession of classified documents that should not have been removed from the state department. The counterintelligence investigation was reportedly triggered after US investigators intercepted a conversation where a Pakistani official claimed their government was receiving US secrets from a prominent former state department diplomat. Raphel refused a plea deal for mishandling classified documents and the case was later dropped.While none of these cases resulted in proven charges of espionage, social media lynchmobs, including hypernationalists in India and in the US, had a field day jumping to conclusions about Tellis, ostensibly based on his writings.Two recent pieces by Tellis in Foreign Affairs magazine offended India partisans: A May 2023 piece headlined “America’s Bad Bet on India” that explained why New Delhi would not side with Washington against Beijing, a common-enough discussion in think-tank circles.In a more recent piece, provocatively headlined “India’s Great Power Delusions,” Tellis argued that India overestimates its influence on the world stage while lacking the economic heft, military capacity, and alliances to back its great-power ambitions. He warned that India’s attachment to strategic autonomy and multipolarity risks making the country irrelevant in an era of intensifying bipolarity, when the competition between China and the United States will shape geopolitics.Neither piece appeared to suggest even remotely that he was shilling, much less spying, for China.After alluding to possible exchanges of manila envelops and red gift bag, the FBI concluded its affidavit saying it ""establishes probable cause in support of a criminal complaint charging Ashley Tellis with the unlawful retention of national defense information.""","Ashley Tellis, 64, is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

The ISPR stated that the Taliban launched coordinated attacks at four points, which were “effectively repulsed” by Pakistani forces. Around 15–20 attackers were killed, it added.The Afghan side has described the attacks as “retaliatory”, accusing Islamabad of conducting airstrikes in its territory. Tensions have worsened amid repeated Pakistani accusations that terrorist groups use Afghan soil to launch attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies these claims, stating that its territory is not being used for such purposes.On Monday, Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif told Geo News: “It’s a stalemate right now.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.

PESHAWAR: Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan 's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the army said on Saturday.The attack took place late Friday night when seven to eight terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) launched a coordinated assault using heavy weapons on the Dera Ismail Khan Police Training Centre in the DI Khan district, near the South Waziristan border.On the intervening night of October 10-11, terrorists attempted to breach the perimeter of the police training school by ramming an explosives-laden truck into its main gate, triggering a massive explosion, the army said in a statement.While one policeman was killed in the attack, six others died in the retaliatory exchange of fire between the security personnel and the terrorists.After the intense five-hour engagement, six terrorists were also eliminated, the army said.During the exchange of fire, the militants continued throwing hand grenades.A mosque inside the institute complex was targeted by the terrorists. The Imam of the mosque was killed in the attack.Around 200 trainees, instructors, and staff members were present at the training school during the attack, police said.Thirteen people, including police personnel, were also injured in the attack, they said.According to officials, all trainee recruits and staff members were safely evacuated to secure locations.Earlier in the day, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a statement said the office of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists.Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, confirmed that the area has been completely cleared.Pakistan continues to reel under terrorism with overall violence surging by 46 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, a media report said last week.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the worst-hit region, suffering nearly 71 per cent (638) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and over 67 per cent (221) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, with over 25 per cent of fatalities (230) and incidents (85).Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies' personnel, and security forces.",Seven policemen were killed and 13 others injured in a terrorist attack at a police training centre in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror





Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Earlier, he said the “future of India‑Afghanistan relations seems very bright.”",Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’ It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124491584,imgsize-1282370,width-400,resizemode-4/shehbaz-sharif-left-amir-muttaqi-and-s-jaishankar-file-agencies.jpg"

Government response and TLP’s history





Massive protests by the hardline Islamist groupescalated into violent clashes across multiple cities on Friday and Saturday, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens injured. Demonstrators marched towards Islamabad in what they called a “Gaza March” to express solidarity with Palestinians and planned to stage a protest outside the United States embassy.TLP launched its protests in Lahore on Thursday, announcing plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following two years of conflict in Gaza. While the demonstrations were initially organised to challenge the ceasefire, the party said the focus had shifted to expressing solidarity with Palestinians.“We have no demands other than showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.The rally, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, began after Friday prayers from the party’s base on Multan Road in Lahore. Thousands joined, chanting religious slogans and carrying sticks and rods. Police set up barricades and used tear gas at key junctions — including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara — but protesters broke through, clashing with security forces and pelting stones.Videos on social media showed demonstrators seizing government vehicles and damaging public property.Violence soon spread to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where authorities placed shipping containers to block roads and fired tear gas to disperse crowds. In return, protesters hurled stones at police. Public life in the twin cities was severely disrupted, with schools shut, the Metro bus service suspended, and mobile internet blocked for a second consecutive day.According to Arab News, TLP claimed that 11 of its supporters had been killed and 50 injured since Thursday, though officials have not commented on the claim. Lahore police confirmed multiple injuries among officers and said more than 100 TLP activists had been arrested for attacking law enforcement and damaging property.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that no group would be allowed to march on Islamabad “under any circumstances,” while State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of “political blackmail” and misusing religious sentiments. “Peaceful protest is a democratic right,” Chaudhry said, “but there is no room for violence or mob pressure.”Founded in 2015, the TLP has a history of staging disruptive protests on religious and political issues. Since its rise in 2017, the group has repeatedly brought parts of Pakistan to a standstill through mass marches and sit-ins that have paralyzed the capital and major highways for days.",Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) launched protests in Lahore on Thursday.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Friday across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 20 security personnel and three civilians.As per news agency AFP, the coordinated assaults included a suicide bombing at a police training school in Dera Ismail Khan district, along with clashes in other districts bordering Afghanistan.Eleven paramilitary troops were killed in the Khyber district, while seven policemen died when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate of the Dera Ismail Khan police training school, followed by an armed assault.“Seven police personnel were martyred and 13 were injured in the attack, while six terrorists were also killed,” Muhammad Hussain, a senior local police official, was quoted as saying by AFP.In Bajaur district, five people—including three civilians—were killed during clashes between militants and paramilitary forces, AFP reported.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attacks, saying, “Such cowardly acts by terrorists cannot shake our resolve against terrorism.We are determined to completely eliminate terrorism from the country.”Islamabad has accused Afghanistan of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim denied by Kabul. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif warned, “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough”, adding that any response could cause collateral damage.Friday’s attacks reflect a surge in militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.As per news agency AP , the assault on the police training school in Ratta Kulachi on Friday involved heavy weapons and lasted nearly six hours.Around 200 recruits and trainers were inside during the attack, and officers returned fire, preventing mass casualties. Six militants were killed in the operation, along with the seizure of suicide vests, explosives, and weapons.Security forces have faced rising threats this year, with over 500 people, including 311 troops and 73 police officers, killed in militant attacks from January to mid-September, according to AFP.The TTP, though allied with the Afghan Taliban, operates independently and remains a major threat along Pakistan’s northwestern border.","The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks across northwestern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Riots Erupt As Pro-Palestine Protests Explode Globally, Cops Battle ‘Israel Haters’ In Major Cities





LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers. ""Now I'll have to figure out again how to reach my office,"" he said.","Clashes erupt in Lahore as police try to stop pro-Palestine march to Islamabad.
