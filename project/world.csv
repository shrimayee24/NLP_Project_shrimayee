'Would you worship Bhagwa terrorist?': Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand says 'don't link terrorism with colour'; questions failure to find Malegaon blast culprits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/would-you-worship-bhagwa-terrorist-shankaracharya-avimukteshwaranand-says-dont-link-terrorism-with-colour-questions-failure-to-find-malegaon-blast-culprits/articleshow/123085236.cms,"Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand

NEW DELHI: The debate over the use of the term 'Saffron Terror', that resumed after the July 31 verdict in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, has refused to die down. Commenting on the term, Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati Maharaj said that colour should not be linked with terrorism. He said those who associate a colour with terrorism are supporting terrorism.The Shankaracharya said, ""A terrorist is a terrorist...What does colour mean with the word terrorism? Terrorism is terrorism, and a zero-tolerance policy should be adopted against it... The Malegaon blast happened, but you could not find the person who committed it...Those who look for colours in terrorism are supporters of terrorism.""The term 'Bhagwa Aatank' or 'saffron terrorism' was first used after the 2002 Gujarat riots, as per a report by the news agency ANI. It was later used again after the 2008 Malegaon blasts. Some political leaders and parties used the term in their statements. The term was also mentioned by then home minister P Chidambaram in an official meeting with police officials. Congress leader Digvijay Singh also used the term in reference to the blasts.The Hindu pontiff also raised questions as to why the government is still unable to catch the culprits of the Malegaon blast case. ""We do not wish to comment on the court’s proceedings; whatever was done in court, we believe, must have been correct. If these people were found innocent in the court’s view, then it is right they were acquitted. But the bigger problem is that the blast did not happen on its own — someone must have done it. Who was it? Where is the Government of India, the state government failing, that someone comes, carries out a blast, and leaves, and despite having vast resources and plenty of time, we are still unable to catch the culprit? This is a big slap on our capability that we cannot apprehend the guilty,"" he said.On July 31, a special NIA court in Mumbai acquitted all seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case. The court said that the prosecution could not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. The court also directed the Maharashtra government to pay Rs 2 lakh compensation to the families of the people who died in the blast, and Rs 50,000 to those who were injured.The seven accused were former MP Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Ajay Rahirkar, Sudhankar Dhar Dwivedi (also known as Shankaracharya), and Sameer Kulkarni.""All bail bonds of the accused are cancelled and sureties are discharged,"" the court said.The court examined 323 witnesses from the prosecution and eight from the defence before giving the verdict. All seven were acquitted of charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Arms Act, and other related charges.The blast occurred on September 29, 2008, near a mosque in Bhikku Chowk area of Malegaon. An explosive device placed on a motorcycle went off, killing six people and injuring 95 others. Initially, 11 people were named as accused, but charges were framed against seven.The lawyer representing the victims’ families has said that he will challenge the acquittal in the high court.Earlier, on the eve of the judgment in the Malegaon blast case, Union home minister Amit Shah had said in Parliament that no Hindu can ever be a terrorist. ""I am proud to say, no Hindu can ever be a terrorist,"" Shah had said in Rajya Sabha.Meanwhile, after the NIA court judgment, former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan also spoke on the matter last week and said that he does not support the use of the term ""saffron terror."" ""Don’t use the term 'Saffron terrorism'. If you want to describe such acts, use 'Hindu fundamentalist' or 'Hindu terrorism' instead.""",Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati Maharaj said that colour should not be linked with terrorism. He said those who associate a colour with terrorism are supporting terrorism. The term 'Bhagwa Aatank' or'saffron terrorism' was first used after the 2002 Gujarat riots.

They had a number that just came out that a tremendous number of Russian soldiers are being killed. And likewise Ukraine, a lower number, but still thousands and thousands of people. And now we're adding towns where they're being hit by missiles. So it's a lot of people being killed in that ridiculous war,"" Trump said.Trump again took the credit for stopping the war between India and Pakistan which Indian officials have already denied in all the public platforms.However, Trump seems to stick to his claims. He not only took the credit for India-Pakistan war, but also said that he stopped Cambodia Thailand, and Congo-Rwanada.""And, you know, we stopped. We stopped a lot of countries from war.

We stopped a lot of wars,"" Trump said.""This is the one we seem to be mission be the easiest to stop. And it's not. I mean, Rwanda and Congo were going on 31 years, and I got it stopped. Eight million people dead. At least that's what they have. But I think the number is much higher. And the leaders of each country, Rwanda and the Congo, they were great. They were great and they wanted it stopped. 31 years it went on. We stopped a lot of wars. Serbia, Kosovo was going to be happening, and I don't believe it will now. So we stopped. That would do,"" he added.Since May 10, Trump has claimed multiple times that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after US-mediated talks. However, officials have firmly denied any US involvement in the recent ceasefire.Even in the Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar refuted Trump's claims and said that there was no foreign mediation.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested a new way for Russia to avoid the sanctions, and that is to get a deal ""where people stop getting killed"" Trump again took the credit for stopping the war between India and Pakistan which Indian officials have already denied in all the public platforms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123085075,imgsize-35076,width-400,resizemode-4/123085075.jpg"

He worked as non-teaching staff at a private school in Dhakuria, in south Kolkata.The incident came to light when his wife, Arati Saha, called out to him in the morning but received no response.

Operation Akhal: Indian Forces Gun Down Terrorist In Kulgam Amid Rising Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: The 'Janaza-Ghaib (funeral in absentia)' of Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - a second confirmation that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 incident in which 26 civilians were killed.Videos and pictures posted on Telegram channels show the elderly of Khai Gala in Rawalkote gathering for the final prayers for the former Pakistan Army soldier and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. But the funeral took an unexpected turn when local LeT commander Rizwan Hanif tried to be part of it. Tahir's family explicitly barred LeT members from attending the funeral but Hanif insisted, leading to a confrontation.Tahir's association with LeT and his role in the Pahalgam attack had made him a wanted category 'A' terrorist. His killing during Operation Mahadev in Srinagar last week along with two others was a major breakthrough for Indian security forces.During the funeral, a source said, ""Lashkar operatives threatened mourners with a gun, sparking outrage among villagers. The residents of Khai Gala, who have long been wary of radicalisation, are now planning a public boycott to oppose terror recruitment.""This development is significant as it not only highlights the growing resistance among POK residents against Pakistan's state-sponsored terror machine but also confirms that the impact of Operation Sindoor - conducted as a response to the Pahalgam attack - is being felt across the border.""A Lashkar commander facing public backlash and being forced to flee is a testament to the changing dynamics in the region,"" the source added.Tahir's past includes his association with the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and the Student Liberation Front (SLF) before joining the Pakistan army. The Sadozai Pathan community, to which Tahir belonged, has a rich history of resistance, having migrated from Afghanistan in the 18th century and playing a key role in the Poonch Rebellion. This also led to Tahir getting the alias of 'Afghani' with which he was known in intelligence records.","Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump once again on Sunday repeated his claims of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, along with ending several other global conflicts.In post on Truth Social, Trump responded to radio host and author Charlamagne Tha God saying the host knew “nothing” about his achievements, including “just ending 5 Wars, including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, where Seven Million people have died, and there was no end in sight.”Trump added, “He didn’t know that, or India and Pakistan or, wiping out Iran’s nuclear capabilities, or closing the horrendous open Border, or creating the greatest economy.”Speaking to Newsmax a day earlier, Trump claimed to have “settled a lot of wars,” including India and Pakistan.“One of the wars—India, Pakistan, nuclear,” he said. He also cited conflicts in Thailand and Cambodia, and Congo and Rwanda, saying many were resolved through trade pressure, reported PTI.“I said ‘listen, you guys are going to fight. You can fight all you want. I mean, just fight your hearts out. But we’re not doing a trade deal’.All of a sudden they end up not doing a war.”Trump added, “I settled a lot of wars. I think I settled averaging about a war a month. But, you know, we’re saving millions of lives.”Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt supported Trump’s claim, saying he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. “Trump has now ended conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia,” she said at a briefing.She claimed Trump has “brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month” in his six months in office.Since May 10, Trump has claimed multiple times that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after US-mediated talks.However, officials have firmly denied any US involvement in the recent ceasefire. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Parliament that no foreign leader urged India to stop Operation Sindoor, launched in response to the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said there was “no third-party intervention” and dismissed any link between the ceasefire and trade.“Prime Minister Modi and Trump did not have any phone calls between April 22, when the Pahalgam terror attack took place, and June 16,” Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha as quoted by PTI.","US President Donald Trump claims to have brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

'Jaw broken, spine injured': SpiceJet staff attacked by Senior Army Official; Video Goes Viral

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been filed against an Army officer posted in north Kashmir for allegedly assaulting and wounding four SpiceJet employees at Srinagar airport on July 26 after being asked to pay for carrying excess cabin baggage on Flight SG 386 to New Delhi. The wounds included a spinal fracture and serious jaw trauma, the airline said Sunday.The officer from High-Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg unleashed what the airline called a “murderous assault” after refusing to pay the fee. The airline said he was carrying “two pieces of cabin baggage weighing a total of 16kg” — more than double the 7kg limit.He allegedly forced his way into the aerobridge without completing boarding formalities — a violation of aviation security protocols — and was escorted back by a CISF officer. At the gate, he turned violent.A video of the attack — showing the officer in jeans and a T-shirt kicking, punching, and hitting staff with a queue stand — has gone viral.“One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee,” the airline said. “Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.”The four staffers were rushed to Bone and Joint Hospital and later referred to SMHS Hospital in Srinagar.Police registered an FIR based on the airline’s complaint. CCTV footage was secured from airport authorities and submitted to police. SpiceJet also started the process to place the officer — whose name and rank hasn’t been made public — on the no-fly list. “SpiceJet will pursue this matter to its fullest legal and regulatory conclusion,” a spokesperson said.Sources claimed the officer was traveling on emergency leave, mistreated by staff, and missed his flight. “He, too, has filed an FIR,” a source said.According to the Army, the case is under investigation. “Based on the outcome, further course of action will be decided,” it said.The defence PRO in Srinagar said: “Indian Army is committed to upholding the highest standards of discipline and conduct and takes all allegations seriously. Full cooperation is being extended to the authorities in investigating the case.”Relatives of the wounded airline staff expressed outrage. “We trusted the system and didn’t approach the media immediately. But we were shocked he was allowed to leave Srinagar the very next day,” one said Sunday.J&K police have not issued a formal statement. CISF said it “intervened promptly, managed the situation and ensured no disruption to flight operations”.SpiceJet has written to civil aviation ministry seeking action and urging a regulatory response.According to DGCA rules, the assault qualifies as Level 2 (physical abuse) and potentially Level 3 — life-threatening behaviour. A Level 2 offence can lead to a six-month flying ban. Level 3 carries a penalty of two years or more, with no upper limit.","An Army officer posted in north Kashmir allegedly assaulted and wounded four SpiceJet employees at Srinagar airport on July 26.

I can’t believe it! My deep condolences to his family and admirers. In his death, we have lost a dharm yoddha. He was a true son of Bharat Mata, very passionate about the noble cause. I pray to the Almighty, to bestow peace on the departed soul.

NEW DELHI: Police in Gurugram have arrested five people, including a woman and her neighbour, for allegedly murdering her husband and concealing his body. The victim, Vikram (37), was a resident of Dundahera village and originally hailed from Nawada in Bihar. His wife, Soni Devi (35), was reportedly in a relationship with the main accused, her neighbour Ravindra (34).According to police, during questioning, Vikram’s wife Soni Devi confessed that she and the main accused, her neighbour Ravinder (34), conspired to kill her husband after her daughter discovered an obscene video of them on Ravinder’s phone and informed Vikram. Investigators said the duo researched murder methods online before executing the plan.Soni Devi had initially filed a missing complaint for her husband at Udyog Vihar police station on July 28. She filed another complaint on July 31 alleging that Ravindra had raped her in March while her husband was away for work.She claimed that Ravindra had made a video of the incident and threatened that if she told anyone about it, he would make the clip public.Following the initial investigation, police arrested Ravindra, who allegedly confessed to murdering Vikram.Two other men, Manish (19) and Fariyaad (20) were also taken into custody for reportedly assisting in the crime. All three were remanded to five days’ police custody on Saturday.Additionally, Ravindra’s uncle, Santarpal (60), was arrested the same day for helping bury Vikram’s body. He, too, was sent to five days’ custody on Sunday. Soni Devi, meanwhile, has been sent to judicial remand.It was during interrogation when Ravindra claimed that he and the woman had been in a relationship, according to a police spokesperson.During questioning, Ravindra told police that on July 26, he and his accomplices forcibly pulled Vikram into a car while he was returning home from work. They strangled him with a rope and later buried his body near Mohammadpur Jharsa village. Based on Ravindra’s disclosure, the body was recovered from the burial site.Police said Soni Devi admitted to having been in a relationship with Ravindra for about a year. She revealed that Ravindra had recorded an obscene video of them, which her daughter accidentally found on his phone and later informed Vikram.Police said both Ravindra and Soni Devi had actively researched online to plan the murder. ""Both the accused, Ravindra and Soni Devi, watched various methods on the Internet and YouTube to kill Vikram and dispose of the body after the murder,"" said a police spokesperson.As part of the plan, Ravindra approached his uncle, Santarpal, who looks after cattle in Mohammadpur Jharsa village.""Ravindra, along with his friends, then killed Vikram and his uncle helped him to bury the body in a pit which was already dug by Santarpal on Ravindra's instructions,"" the official added.Investigators also confirmed that Soni Devi remained in regular contact with Ravindra by phone during this entire episode. “In order to mislead the police, she first filed a missing report of her husband on July 28, while the woman knew that her husband had been murdered on July 26 and his body had been buried. We are questioning the accused,” the spokesperson said.","Police in Gurugram have arrested five people, including a woman and her neighbour, for allegedly murdering her husband.

A couple allegedly abandoned their 10-year-old son at the Barcelona Airport after discovering his passport had expired, choosing to board their flight home without him to avoid missing it, reported The Sun.A terminal worker who goes by the name of Lilian has posted a video on social media, criticizing the actions of the parents, garnering over 300,000 views. In her video, she claims that the parents reportedly arranged for a relative to pick their son up so that they could continue their journey.However, their unusual plan unraveled when airport staff discovered the boy alone and alerted the police, according to the air traffic coordinator.""He told them that his parents were on the plane on their way to their home country, going on vacation,"" Lilian said in her video, reported The Sun.""His passport in the country was expired, so the child was travelling with a Spanish passport but the Spanish passport needed a visa.

Police ruled out any foul play or negligence on the part of Hersheypark's water park after a 9-year-old girl, Sophia Subedi, drowned on July 24.

Bhutanese-origin Sophia Subedi was spotted in a state of distress in the wave pool at the Boardwalk at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania.A lifeguard pulled her from the pool and performed CPR on her. She was taken to Milton S. Hershey Medical Center where she was pronounced dead. A Hersheypark spokesperson said there were 100 lifeguards – trained and certified through Ellis & Associates (E&A) -- at the Boardwalk at the time of the incident. They also said there were 10 lifeguards specifically dedicated to the wave pool at the time.After Subedi’s death, Derry Township Police launched an investigation, which included a review of video footage, statements from witnesses, employees and first responders, and documentation of the physical scene.On Friday, police said they finalized their review of the incident and determined that Subedi died from accidental freshwater drowning.There was no criminal activity involved and the safety standards at the theme park were also maintained. There was no overcrowding and the number of people in the wave pool was actually less than its designed maximum capacity.“It was also noted that nearby witnesses and lifeguards responded promptly, initiating rescue and resuscitation efforts within seconds of noticing Sophia's distress,” a Derry Township Police spokesperson wrote. “The Derry Township Police Department, along with the witnesses, Hersheypark staff, and first responders who attempted to save Sophia, extend their sincere condolences to her family and friends, as well as the Bhutanese community, during this difficult time.

Donning a head-to-toe yellow denim ensemble, influencer Tiffany Fong dropped a video recreating Sydney Sweeney and the controversial American Eagle ad. ""Handed down by my parents before me and their parents before them, my genes are yellow,"" Tiffany Fong said as she ate rice with chopsticks, calling it the Asian version of the American Eagle ad. There is no wordplay with genes and jeans here, as Tiffany Fong meant only jeans and not genes, unlike the American Eagle advertisement that is at the center of a major controversy.The row has drawn a political line as well, with MAGA leaders blaming the liberals for targeting the advertisement. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue,” Sydney Sweeney said in the viral advertisement, drawing flak for glorifying good genes.American Eagle defended the campaign, saying that it is only about jeans. “‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans’ is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” the brand said without bowing down to the pressure.Vice president JD Vance commented on the controversy and said the liberals are attacking everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney is beautiful.“And it’s like, you guys, did you learn nothing from the November 2024 election? Like I actually thought that one of the lessons they might take is we’re going to be less crazy. The lesson they have apparently taken is we’re going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful. Great strategy, guys,” he added.“That’s how you’re going to win the midterm, especially young American men. Their course correction lasts about 30 seconds,” Vance said, adding that the Democrats have gone even crazier.While social media users are praising Tiffany Fong's video, she was recently in the news after a report said that she refused to bear Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's baby.","Influencer Tiffany Fong made a video recreating Sydney Sweeney and the controversial American Eagle ad.

Court allows scientist to resume duties at IIL





DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand HC has suspended the conviction and five-year rigorous imprisonment of a vaccine scientist found guilty of abetment to suicide following the death of his wife in 2015.Justice Ravindra Maithani granted the relief to Dr Akash Yadav during the pendency of his appeal, saying his role was ""undoubtedly essential for public health and national interest"" and his conviction had rendered him ineligible to continue contributing to vaccine programmes.Yadav, a vaccinologist with a PhD in biotechnology from IIT-Kgp, had been working as a senior manager at Indian Immunologicals Limited, a PSU that makes human and veterinary vaccines and plays a critical role in national immunisation efforts. tnnYadav was convicted by a sessions court under IPC section 306 for abetment to suicide but was acquitted under section 304-B (dowry death) and the Dowry Prohibition Act.He married on May 7, 2015. His wife, who was employed at Pantnagar University, was taken to her maternal home by her brother on July 4, 2015, while Yadav was working in Hyderabad. She resumed her duties but died by suicide on Dec 14, 2015. In her suicide note, she stated that her husband would be responsible for her death. Yadav was arrested on May 11, 2017, and after spending more than three months in jail, he got bail on Aug 28.On Jan 21 this year, the sessions judge of Rudrapur sentenced him to five-year RI and a fine of Rs 20,000 under Section 306.After being granted bail, Yadav filed an interim application under section 389(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking suspension of his conviction.He submitted that because of the conviction, he had become disqualified from working with Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL) and was unable to resume his scientific duties. His counsel argued that the case met the criteria for exceptional circumstances, as the conviction had a direct impact on ""work of national importance.""Justice Maithani noted that an appellate court can suspend a conviction if failure to do so would result in injustice or irreversible consequences. He cited the Supreme Court rulings in Navjot Singh Sidhu vs State of Punjab (2007) and Rama Narang vs Ramesh Narang (1995) and said that courts must examine whether maintaining the conviction would unfairly affect a person's professional standing or public interest responsibilities.The bench observed, ""This was a greater issue of public health and national interest. In light of the afore-stated reasons, the court was of the view that this was a fit case in which the order of conviction as well as execution of sentence, appealed against, should be suspended.""The high court suspended both the conviction and sentence during the appeal's pendency, allowing Yadav to resume his duties at IIL.","Uttarakhand HC suspends conviction and five-year rigorous imprisonment of Dr Akash Yadav.

NAVI MUMBAI: MNS workers allegedly vandalised a bar in Panvel late on Saturday, hours after a fiery speech of their party president Raj Thackeray condemning the functioning of dance bars in the ‘sacred land’ of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Raigad.Police have registered a case against 15 individuals under the relevant BNS sections following a viral video of some men storming into Night Riders The Bar, vandalising furniture, smashing liquor bottles, and damaging the property. Police said they have identified eight of the accused, including MNS office-bearer Yogesh Chile.Panvel taluka police senior inspector Gajanan Ghadge said ight Riders The Bar has a valid licence and the deadline to close is 1.30am, but the MNS workers vandalised the bar around midnight. The accused MNS workers are untraceable as they have switched off their phones.While addressing a gathering at the 78th foundation day of Peasants and Workers Party, Thackeray questioned the operation of illegal dance bars in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s “sacred land” Raigad district.He alleged that these dance bars were run by nonMarathi people who were spoiling the local youth. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut was also present at the event.Local activist Anarjit Chauhan alleged that the vandalism seems to be politically motivated keeping in mind the upcoming municipal elections in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. “Dance bars with women employees, like Night Riders The Bar, have been operating for years...if politicians see any immoral activity here, why didn't the police take any legal action? There seems to be a political agenda here,” he said.","MNS workers allegedly vandalised a bar in Panvel late on Saturday, hours after a fiery speech of their party president Raj Thackeray.

Thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday, braving heavy rain and winds, to call for an end to the war in Gaza.Assange, who returned to Australia last year following his release from British prison, was seen surrounded by family and walking alongside former Australian foreign minister and New South Wales premier Bob Carr. Assange however, did not address the crowd or speak to the media.New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani took to X to share a video of the Sydney protest, stating: “Over 300,000 people in rain marched across Sydney Harbour Bridge today in solidarity with Gaza. Israel has been exposed — and its crimes will never be forgotten.”New South Wales Police said hundreds of extra personnel had been deployed across Sydney to manage the large-scale demonstration, which drew participants chanting slogans such as “ceasefire now” and “free Palestine.”Australia’s Labor Party MP Ed Husic also attended the rally and urged his ruling party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, to officially recognise a Palestinian state.While Australia has called for an end to the war in Gaza, it has yet to make a formal move towards recognising Palestine. However, in a joint statement with more than a dozen other nations on Tuesday, Australia expressed its “willingness or positive consideration... to recognise the state of Palestine as an essential step towards the two-State solution.”International pressure has been mounting over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In recent weeks, countries including France, Britain, and Canada have signalled their intention to diplomatically recognise a Palestinian state.","Thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday.

"US-China talks hit energy roadblock: Beijing defies pressure to halt Russian, Iranian oil imports amid tariff threats; trade deal at a crossroads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-talks-hit-energy-roadblock-beijing-defies-pressure-to-halt-russian-iranian-oil-imports-amid-tariff-threats-trade-deal-at-a-crossroads/articleshow/123086023.cms,"AI-generated image

In a critical juncture for US-China trade relations, officials from both nations are working to resolve their differences and potentially reach a trade agreement that could prevent the imposition of severe tariffs.However, a significant sticking point reportedly remains- the US demand for China to cease purchasing oil from Iran and Russia. China's Foreign Ministry took to X on Wednesday, following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, to assert its stance. ""China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,"" the ministry stated, responding to the US threat of a 100 per cent tariff. The ministry further emphasized, ""Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests."" This response comes at a time when both Beijing and Washington are expressing optimism about reaching a deal to stabilize commercial ties between the world's two largest economies.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking to reporters after the talks, acknowledged China's firm stance on its sovereignty. ""The Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously,"" Bessent said, as quoted by the Associated Press.He added, ""We do not want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100 per cent tariff."" Despite the challenges, Bessent remains hopeful about the negotiations. ""I believe that we have the makings of a deal,"" he told CNBC, describing the Chinese as ""tough"" negotiators.Gabriel Wildau, managing director of consultancy Teneo, expressed skepticism about the US following through with the 100 per cent tariff threat. ""Realising those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance"" for a trade deal announcement between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Wildau noted.The US aims to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran to reduce funding for their militaries, as Moscow continues its war against Ukraine and Tehran supports militant groups in the Middle East. China's firm stance is not new. When Trump announced a broad tariff plan in April, China was the only country to retaliate. ""If the US is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end,"" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies in Beijing, quoted by AP.Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, suggested that Beijing might use the situation as leverage to gain more concessions from Trump. Meanwhile, Danny Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute remarked that Beijing sees itself as ""the one holding the cards"" in its dealings with Washington.China's continued oil purchases from Russia and Iran are crucial for its strategic energy supply. A 2024 report by the US Energy Information Administration indicates that a significant portion of Iran's oil exports go to China, which imports over one million barrels of Iranian oil daily. Additionally, China is a major customer for Russian oil, second only to India. The ongoing negotiations and China's firm stance underscore the complexities of US-China trade relations, with energy policies playing a pivotal role in the discussions.","China's Foreign Ministry took to X on Wednesday, following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, to assert its stance.

Sydney Sweeney Ad Row: JD Vance Unbuckles On 'Nazi' Noise, American Eagle Keeps It Casual

The Republican Registration That Launched a Thousand Memes



Shooting Range Superstar: From HBO to the NRA



“Sydney Sweeney: America’s New Annie Oakley.”

“She can shoot AND act? Wife me.”

“Meanwhile your favourite liberal thinks Nerf is a hate crime.”

The Power of Saying Nothing



The Post-Woke Celebrity Archetype



Ambiguity over affirmation

Style over slogans

Presence over preaching

Why MAGA Can’t Stop Posting Her



She’s young. The GOP’s problem has always been youth appeal. Sydney solves that.

She’s beautiful. Liberal feminists would call that “problematic.” The Right calls it reality.

She’s talented. Awards, praise, and prestige roles, all without being preachy.

She’s silent. No need to cancel. No need to apologise. No moral panic. Just vibes.

The Mirror, Not the Mouthpiece







In the first of the Republican National Conservative debates, when Trump steadfastly refused to participate to show Fox who was the man, then-presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy summed up the inflection point that was about to overshadow America: “You want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to ‘stick it to the man’? Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative. ”It’s true. Being liberal used to be an act of rebellion. But that rebellion became mainstream, corporatised, and institutionalised. It now lives on as HR slideshows, Twitter mobs, and avocado ad campaigns. Being young and Republican in 2025 is an act of defiance. And today’s protestants become tomorrow’s mainstream—evidenced by the fact that there are now more young people who identify as Republican than Democrat in America.It’s not clear when the Left lost the youth. Perhaps it was the cascade of madness: the woke craze of pushing trans behaviour in grammar schools. Demanding biological males be allowed to play in women’s sports. Saying illegal immigrants should have unfettered access to welfare. Shouting “Defund the Police” while shoplifting turned into organised retail looting. Declaring obesity a form of body positivity. Telling working-class white kids that their skin colour was an inherited sin.Declaring that whiteness ought to be apologised for.Slowly, the country shifted. Not by campaign ads or policy briefings—but by exhaustion. And as America began tuning out the moral lectures from elites, late-night comedians, and Hollywood, a new icon quietly emerged. Not a pundit. Not a senator. Not a firebrand. A muse.In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year—without attending a single rally or issuing a single press release. The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video that could’ve doubled as NRA propaganda. Welcome to 2025, where political identity is crafted less by what you say, and more by which side claims you.It recently emerged that Sydney Sweeney is registered as a Republican in Florida. That was it.She didn’t make a political speech. She didn’t wear a MAGA hat. She didn’t retweet Ben Shapiro. All she did was file the correct paperwork, and the internet found it. Her name. Her address. Her party.Suddenly, the Right had its new pin-up girl. The Left had a meltdown.For conservatives, this was a cultural coup. A beautiful, talented Hollywood starlet—young, blonde, wildly popular—was officially red. Not pink. Not centrist. Red. And best of all? She wasn’t saying sorry for it.The silence was glorious. No apology tour. No clarifying tweet. No “I was hacked” statement. Liberals demanded answers. Progressives called it a betrayal. But Sydney Sweeney didn’t flinch. And in an age where even Instagram captions are pored over for political subtext, saying nothing is a weapon.“Great Jeans” and the Eugenics Panic of Summer 2025Then came the American Eagle campaign.Sydney Sweeney, in tight denim and a tank top, staring into the camera under the caption: “Great Genes.”That’s it. That’s the ad.Within hours, the internet exploded. Not because of the fashion. Not because of the cut. But because of the word: “genes.” Not jeans. Genes.The Left read it as a eugenics dog whistle. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman fronting a brand with a tagline that sounded suspiciously like white supremacy.Satirical Twitter lit up: “This is Leni Riefenstahl for Gen Z.” “Are they selling pants or the master race?”But the Right? The Right cackled. This was proof. Proof that the outrage industry had gone too far. That even a pun could be labelled fascist. That Sydney Sweeney, just by existing in her natural body and not issuing trigger warnings, was now enemy number one.American Eagle didn’t back down. Sales spiked. The controversy became the campaign. Sydney didn’t write the tagline. She was just the face. But once again, the narrative moved around her. She became the accidental symbol of conservative resistance to liberal hysteria.And then the final seal was pressed: the shooting range video.Sydney, in casualwear and earmuffs, loading a Glock like she was born in Fort Benning. First-time shooter? Didn’t look like it. Her stance, her focus, her shot grouping—it was enough to make half of Republican Twitter swoon.Clips went viral:The symbolism was perfect. A young woman in Hollywood, not just pretending to shoot in a Netflix movie—but actually firing rounds at a paper target, calmly, confidently. No virtue signalling. No trembling hands. Just recoil and resolve.The Right didn't need words. The imagery was enough. Mainstream Republicans quickly rallied behind Sydney Sweeney. Vice President JD Vance criticised Democrats for “calling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi,” saying it showed how out of touch the party had become with young voters. Senator Ted Cruz also weighed in, posting on X: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well. ” Inside the White House, officials saw the controversy as a win, saying it helped highlight what they view as liberal overreach and cultural policing. For many Republicans, Sweeney’s party registration wasn’t just a detail—it was confirmation that the culture war was breaking their way.What makes Sydney Sweeney such a potent figure is precisely her ambiguity.She doesn’t tweet about taxes. She doesn’t complain about feminism. She doesn’t post “I Voted” stickers or abortion fundraisers. She doesn’t do red carpet activism. And in 2025, that absence speaks louder than any hashtag.Hollywood thrives on performative wokeness. Stars compete to signal their virtue—whether it's climate guilt on private jets or apologies for being cast as straight characters. Sydney Sweeney has opted out.That, to a large chunk of America, makes her radical. Because silence is now seen as alignment. Refusing to bend the knee is tantamount to opposition. And that’s why both sides are fighting to frame her.To liberals, she’s naive at best, complicit at worst. To conservatives, she’s a unicorn: the apolitical star who still represents everything they believe in—beauty, freedom, guns, and denim.What Sydney Sweeney represents is something new: the post-woke Hollywood icon. Not a right-wing activist. Not a left-wing darling. But someone who has managed to float above the trench warfare.This new archetype is defined by:She’s not talking about CRT, climate change, or colonialism. She’s talking about her dog. Or her workout. Or her skincare routine. And yet, her silence makes her subversive.She isn’t against the Left in any direct sense. She’s just not of it. And that distinction matters.There’s a reason conservative media can’t get enough of her:In other words, she’s the anti-Lena Dunham. The anti-Alyssa Milano. The anti-everything that drove red-state Americans away from Hollywood.The Culture War’s Most Valuable PawnSydney Sweeney didn’t ask to be drafted into the culture war. She just voted. Then modelled. Then fired a gun.But in the content economy, you don’t get to choose how you're used. She became a screen onto which America projected its anxieties and aspirations. And the fact that she never pushed back made her more powerful.The Right turned her into a meme. The Left turned her into a warning. And Sydney? Sydney went back to work. To movies. To photo shoots. To her life.That may be the most radical thing of all.Sydney Sweeney is not giving speeches. She’s not asking for your vote. She’s not applying to be the next Kayleigh McEnany.She is simply existing. But in 2025, that’s all it takes.She is a mirror—reflecting everything America wants to believe, or fears to acknowledge. To the Right, she’s the proof that Hollywood doesn’t own the narrative. To the Left, she’s a reminder that silence can be resistance too.And in a country where every movie, every tweet, every ad campaign becomes a battleground, Sydney Sweeney has done the unthinkable.She said nothing. And everyone heard it.","The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle.

BHUBANESWAR: The Crime Branch investigation into the recent self-immolation of a 20-year-old college student in Balasore took a dramatic twist on Monday following the arrest of two students, including one previously hailed as a hero for reportedly trying to save her, on charges of abetment.Investigators found that both students had allegedly instigated the victim to take the extreme step after college authorities failed to address her sexual harassment complaint against the Head of Department (HoD).“Strong evidence of abetment to suicide led to their arrests,” confirmed IGP, S Shyni of the Crime Against Women and Children's Wing, to TOI.Investigations revealed that the student who claimed to have attempted rescue actually sustained burns while recording the incident on his mobile phone from close proximity. “Multiple video clips of the incident were recovered from his phone,” another Crime Branch official said.The suspect had earlier garnered public sympathy and media attention for his supposed rescue attempt. While receiving treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack for 15% burns, he had recounted: ""I rushed toward her when she lit the match, but the flames spread instantly, burning my face and clothes before I could reach her.""The incident occurred on July 12 when the victim, protesting against the administration's inaction on her sexual harassment complaint, doused herself in petrol and self-immolated outside the principal's office.Initially admitted to Balasore district hospital with 95% burns, she was later rushed to AIIMS Bhubaneswar, where she succumbed to her injuries on July 14 at 11:46 PM. Following public and political outrage, both the accused HoD and college principal were arrested.","The 20-year-old self-immolation of a college student in Balasore took a dramatic twist on Monday.

Facing limited diplomatic options to resolve the hostage crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a “military solution” to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, an Israeli official was quoted as saying by ABC News on Sunday.Netanyahu has proposed expanding military operations in Gaza, aiming to use force to rescue approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive since their capture during Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.The official said that there is an increasing understanding within the Israeli leadership that Hamas is not interested in making a deal for the officials, reports ABC News.""Therefore, prime minister Netanyahu is pushing to expand military operations to release the hostages through a military solution,"" said the official.Tens of thousands gathered in the coastal city of Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand that Netanyahu’s government secure the release of the remaining hostages.""They are on the absolute brink of death,"" said Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, whose video was released by Hamas showing him in what he described as digging his own grave.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"
'Go to hell': Trump slams Schumer as senate leaves 130+ nominees unconfirmed before August recess; urges GOP to hold line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/go-to-hell-trump-slams-schumer-as-senate-leaves-130-nominees-unconfirmed-before-august-recess-urges-gop-to-hold-line/articleshow/123078015.cms,"US President Donald Trump, left, and senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (Image credits: AP)

Trump Rages At Schumer As Senate Talks Collapse, Nominations And Budget Face Gridlock





US President Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday, telling him to “GO TO HELL” after the Senate left Washington for its August recess without confirming over 130 of his executive branch nominees.A deal between Republicans and Democrats collapsed, and many key appointments remain stalled. Trump had urged the Senate to stay in session, but negotiations failed— leaving dozens of political appointees in limbo and the president fuming.“Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump was reacting to what he described as an unreasonable demand by Senate Democrats, accusing Schumer of tying nominee approvals to a $1 billion funding request, reported The New York Post.“This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name. Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” he addedTrump followed up with urging Republicans to hold firm and use the recess to rally public support, rather than accepting a compromise with Democrats.“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”Senate majority leader John Thune acknowledged the failed negotiations and the multiple attempts to reach an agreement with Schumer before recess. “There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end.”Thune had been working with Schumer on a proposal to bundle nominee votes into two rounds—one before the recess and another afterward. But Democrats were reportedly seeking guarantees from Trump to restore funding for foreign aid and the National Institutes of Health, which the administration had frozen.The breakdown led to frustration on both sides, and senators were eager to begin their August break.Schumer, under pressure from his party’s progressive base, later celebrated the failure of the confirmation deal.“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn’t let him,” he said in a post on X Sunday.“Donald Trump’s style: Posture[,] Cajole[,] Stamp your feet… and then give up,” he added in a follow up post.With the deal dead, some Republicans suggested changing Senate rules to prevent Democrats from blocking confirmations. However, moderate GOP senators were reluctant, fearing the same rules could be used against them in the future.Thune allowed the Senate to continue holding pro forma sessions, ceremonial meetings that block Trump from making recess appointments, ensuring his nominees cannot be confirmed without Senate votes. Although the Senate passed three of twelve required appropriations bills, several key funding bills remain stuck in committee.According to senate appropriations chair Susan Collins, it marks the first time since 2018 that any funding bills were passed before the August recess. If the remaining bills aren’t approved by October 1, the government faces a partial shutdown, The New York Post reported.","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

Israel's 'Secret' Syria Raid: IDF Paratroopers Storm 4 Sites In South Syria As Sweida Truce Frays





Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith after US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers accused him of engaging in illegal political activity during his investigations into Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.The US office of special counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is looking into Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act- a law that bars certain political activities by federal employees.The OSC is distinct from the justice department’s special counsel’s office, which Smith led during his investigation into Trump.While the OSC cannot bring criminal charges, it can recommend disciplinary action such as removal from the federal workforce. It may also refer findings to the Department of Justice, although that is uncommon.Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., formally requested the investigation on Wednesday, accusing Smith of “unprecedented interference in the 2024 election.”Smith was appointed special counsel by then-attorney general Merrick Garland in November 2022, just three days after Trump announced his presidential bid. He later brought two criminal indictments against Trump in 2023 but stepped down from the role slightly more than a week before Trump’s inauguration in January 2024.Neither case reached trial.“Jack Smith’s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,” Cotton said in a post on X Wednesday. “This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.”Cotton also claimed Smith pushed for a “rushed trial” of Trump, though he has not released specific evidence of illegal conduct.Hatch Act violations are rarely referred to the DOJ. In 2019, the OSC recommended then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for Hatch Act violations, but the issue did not lead to prosecution.Meanwhile, Trump’s nominee to lead the OSC, Paul Ingrassia, remains stalled in the senate. A White House official said that Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of controversial remarks, is currently holding one-on-one meetings with senators as part of the confirmation process.","Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith.

Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has made a significant donation to a GiveSendGo fundraiser supporting a woman named Holly, who was assaulted during a violent mob attack in downtown Cincinnati.The incident, which went viral, showed Holly being punched while trying to help another victim during the chaotic street brawl.American commentator and YouTuber Benny Johnson shared a screenshot of Ramaswamy’s donation, writing on X, ""Wow. @VivekGRamaswamy just made an incredibly generous donation to Holly’s GiveSendGo. Thank you to all who’ve shown up for her. 100% goes to Holly.""The fundraiser has now surpassed $100,000 in donations. ""We have now officially raised $100,000 for Holly in just one night. This is one of the most successful GiveSendGo campaigns in history,"" Johnson posted earlier.Ramaswamy had earlier condemned the attack and criticised the absence of police and emergency services.Earlier, in a post on X, he wrote, ""It’s unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.Hard-working Americans shouldn’t have to worry for their safety when they have a good time in our cities.”He added that Holly, a single working mother, told him no public official aside from one detective had contacted her. ""Leftists like to lecture about ‘systemic injustice’ while thugs turn our cities into war zones. I’m done with their excuses,"" Ramaswamy said.If elected in the coming year, Ramaswamy declared, ""We're going to set an example for what that looks like in Ohio.""The viral video of the incident shows a man being chased into the street, shoved to the ground, and beaten by a crowd.One individual body-slams him while others kick and stomp him. As the man tries to get up, a woman, later identified as Holly, rushes to help, only to be punched twice in the face.She collapses to the pavement, hitting her head and bleeding from the mouth as the crowd continues to cheer.The clip has sparked outrage and renewed calls for better safety and policing in urban areas.","Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has made a significant donation to a GiveSendGo fundraiser supporting a woman named Holly.

'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear; delays probe into martial law plot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/disgraceful-ex-south-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol-resists-questioning-by-laying-down-in-underwear-delays-probe-into-martial-law-plot/articleshow/123077586.cms,"South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol (Image credits: PTI)





South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said Friday, after a fresh attempt to bring him in for interrogation over election tampering allegations failed.Although already in custody on charges related to his attempt to impose martial law in December, prosecutors were required to serve a new warrant to question him in a separate case involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee.Assistant special prosecutor Oh Jeong-hee said a team of special prosecutors attempted to execute the warrant but were forced to abandon the effort after Yoon refused to cooperate.“The special prosecutors urged him to voluntarily comply with the arrest warrant, taking into account his status as a former president,” Oh said as quoted by South China Morning Post. “But the suspect persistently refused, remaining on the floor and declining to put on his prison uniform.”Prosecutors repeated the request four times over 20- to 30-minute intervals before halting the operation after two hours, citing concerns that using physical force might lead to harm.“During the process, the suspect was informed that the next attempt to execute the warrant would proceed even with the use of physical force,” Oh added.She noted that Yoon had long championed “rule of law, fairness, and common sense,” adding, “The public is closely watching whether the law is applied equally to all. We hope the suspect, who once served as a prosecutor, prosecutor general and president, will respect and comply with legal procedures.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, criticised Yoon’s actions. “No criminal defies the rule of law in such a disgraceful way,” he said, as cited by South China Morning Post. “The former leader is showing no remorse and portraying himself as a victim of political persecution.”Yoon was first arrested on January 15 by the corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. He was released after 52 days due to procedural issues, but rearrested on July 10 on new charges, including obstruction of official duties. Since then, he has refused to leave his cell for questioning. Prosecutors later added charges, alleging he instructed his security team to interfere with his earlier arrest.He is also resisting a separate probe into alleged election meddling involving his wife. The couple is accused of influencing People Power Party nominations for local and National Assembly elections.In April, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon’s impeachment, originally passed by the National Assembly in response to the martial law attempt.","South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said.

Two days after President Donald Trump fired the top labour official in charge of compiling statistics on employment, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, insisted on Sunday that the administration was ""absolutely not"" shooting the messenger on the heels of a poor jobs report. But Hassett repeatedly declined to furnish detailed evidence that would substantiate the president's claims that the data had been rigged or manipulated to hurt him politically. Trump cited that justification in his decision to fire Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labour Statistics(BLS), in a widely rebuked move on Friday.""The president wants his own people there, so that when we see the numbers, they're more transparent and more reliable,"" Hassett told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" explaining at one point that the president sought to ensure jobs numbers could be ""trusted."" In a second appearance, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Hassett claimed there were ""partisan patterns"" in the jobless data, and said that ""data can't be propaganda."" Since McEntarfer's sudden dismissal, economists across the political spectrum have offered a more worrisome assessment, warning that Trump's actions threaten to pollute the non-partisan work at BLS to measure the trajectory of economy.","Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, insisted on Sunday that the administration was ""absolutely not"" shooting the messenger.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Sunday, accusing the broadcaster of knowing “nothing” about him or his accomplishments. The backlash came after Charlamagne, whose real name is Lenard McKelvey, offered a critical assessment of Trump's time in office.“I wouldn’t give it a good rating simply because the least of us are still being impacted the worst,” Charlamagne said Thursday on a Fox News show hosted by Lara Trump, the US President’s daughter-in-law and former co-chair of the Republican National Committee.In response, Trump took to Truth Social, calling the radio host a “low IQ individual” who “has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done - like just ending 5 Wars, including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, where Seven Million people have died, and there was no end in sight.”The US President at the same time, took a jibe at former president Joe Biden and former vice president Kamala Harris , saying, “STUPID and CORRUPT JOE BIDEN set the record for doing the Worst Job as President, EVER. But this dope, Charlamagne, would vote for Sleepy Joe or Kamala?”Trump also took issue with Charlamagne’s use of God in his professional name, writing, “(Why is he allowed to use the word ""GOD"" when describing himself? Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?""Charlamagne acknowledged benefiting from Trump-era tax cuts but said the legislation hurt many Americans.“There’s going to be so many people that’s hurt by that bill. Anything that takes away Medicaid from people and will put people in a worse financial situation than they were previously in, I’m not for,"" he said, as quoted by AP.The radio host also predicted a shift within the Republican Party, claiming that traditional conservatives could use controversy surrounding Trump’s handling of Jeffrey Epstein-related records to challenge his control of the party.“I think there’s a political coup going on right now in the Republican Party that people aren’t paying attention to,” Charlamagne said, as cited by AP. “I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back. I really do.”He continue, “I think they know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up... for the first time they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base. I think they’re going to do that.”Trump has faced renewed criticism from some of his supporters after the Justice Department announced it would not release additional documents related to the Epstein investigation. Trump had previously promised to release the Epstein Files, which many had speculated contained a list of high-profile individuals associated, including Trump himself. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.Charlamagne told Lara Trump that his critiques of political leaders are not limited to one party. “I gave President Biden the same hell” when he believed the Democratic president was falling short, he said.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Sunday, accusing the broadcaster of knowing “nothing” about him or his accomplishments.
