Special Briefing by MEA on Prime Minister’s overseas visit (February 07, 2025)

NEW DELHI: Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Friday, responding to a question about the use of a military aircraft for deporting Indian 'aliens,' said that, according to the US administration, the deportation was classified as a national security operation. As a result, a military aircraft was used instead of the commercial flights typically used in previous deportations.Misri said, ""We have been very transparent with our US counterparts on this issue, including the use of a military airplane. The deportation that took place the day before yesterday is somewhat different from earlier flights that have been happening for many years. As you would be aware, this case is of a slightly different nature because, in the US system itself, it was described as a national security operation, and that is perhaps one of the reasons why a military aircraft was used.""He said, ""In recent conversation we have sought details about potential returnees from US we have been told that there are upto 487 presumed Indian citizens with final removal order with the US authorities. We have sought details and identifying details and particular have been supplied to us with regard to 298 individuals. We received this a short while ago, we are checking on this and will revert on this with out US counterparts on these issue, about the others we have not yet been provided details.""On potential alternatives, he added, ""Insofar as alternatives are concerned, we will consider options that would be feasible.""Regarding the exact number of deportees, Misri acknowledged the varying figures being reported but said official confirmation would be given only after verifying their Indian citizenship.""Now, of course, many among us in this room will say that multiple numbers are floating around. But I can only provide a firm answer regarding the numbers once I can confirm that they are indeed Indian citizens,"" he said.He further stated, ""I can tell you that we have a certain number of Indian citizens, and there will be aircraft available with a specific capacity. You can do the math on how many flights that would amount to.""","Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Friday, responding to a question about the use of a military aircraft for deporting Indian 'aliens,' said that, according to the US administration, the deportation was classified as a national security operation.

DEHRADUN: Army Public School in Birpur area of Dehradun has rescinded a notice sent on Feb 1 barring students with less than 60% in pre-board exams from attending the school farewell. Officials said that after a complaint was made in the matter, the state child rights commission stepped in to intervene.The notice, issued by the principal, was widely shared on social media.""When it was brought to our attention, we summoned the principal and demanded an explanation regarding the bizarre notice. They have now rescinded it, allowing all students to attend,"" said the commission's secretary, S K Barnwal. The commission also issued a warning to the school.Sources said the school administration had verbally informed the students about a similar decision last year but this year, a formal notice was issued, allegedly in consultation with the parents.Officials from the commission said that while verbal ultimatums might push students to perform better, a written notice of this nature is demoralising. ""Student scoring low in pre-boards is not indicative of their overall academic performance. They can improve in board exams. Keeping them away from a once-a-term social event is both unfair and upsetting,"" Barnwal added. The school could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts by TOI.Meanwhile, commenting on the issue, Arif Khan, president, National Association for Parents and Students rights, said, ""Such a notice, days before a student's board exams is very demotivating. It is bound to have an effect on their mental health. All students should have the experience of a farewell irrespective of their academic performances.

Government sources, who confirmed that there are 96 more verified Indian nationals who may be deported to India soon, did not rule out the possibility of PM Narendra Modi himself raising the mistreatment issue with President Donald Trump in what will be their first bilateral meeting since the latter’s inauguration.“Yes, we have registered our concerns with the US (on mistreatment),’’ said foreign secretary Vikram Misri, responding to a query from TOI about whether India had, like Brazil, officially protested the treatment meted out to its citizens. Significantly, Misri also said at a media briefing that the military deportation to Amritsar, compared to earlier flights in the past, was of “slightly different nature” as the Trump administration has characterised deportation as a national security operation. “That’s perhaps one of the reasons why a military plane was used,’’ he said.Misri also revealed that, as of now, there are 487 presumed Indian nationals facing the final removal order in the US. Out of these, the Trump administration has shared the details of 295 people whose Indian origin is being verified by Indian authorities. TOI has learnt that the US has initially shared a list of 203 Indians for deportation. The 104 Indian nationals who have returned are part of the same list. Of the remaining 99, India has verified the citizenship of 96 people who are expected to be on the next deportation flight to India. This number could go up depending upon when the next flight is conducted and as India verifies more people for deportation.Describing the treatment of illegal Indian migrants as avoidable and a valid issue to raise, Misri said India will continue to raise this issue with US authorities. While India has accepted more than 15,000 illegal Indian migrants from the US in the past 16 years, the flight that landed in Amritsar this week with 104 Indian nationals saw possibly the first use of a military aircraft for deporting Indians. Countries like Mexico, Brazil and Colombia have been reluctant to accept such flights, citing human rights violations Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in Parliament Thursday that US deportations are executed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as per a 2012 SOP, which allows use of restraints, and that India is engaging US authorities to ensure deportees are not mistreated. Asked if India at that point of time had registered a protest with American authorities, Misri said there was no record of any such protest.According to Indian officials, the US conveyed to India that using a military aircraft would be the quickest way of deporting people. While Misri did not confirm if India was contemplating sending, like Colombia, its own plane for deportation, he said India is open to exploring other alternatives. “A request was made that this would be the quickest way to do it, but there are other types of flights that have taken place in the past and we remain open to exploring all of these alternatives for the future as well,’’ said Misri.He also said that India would not like to be seen as an uncooperative category on the issue of illegal migration but added that “any country in the world, if it is going to accept its nationals back, will want to have the assurance that whosoever is coming back is a bona fide citizen of India”.","India has protested the US handling of Indian deportees, who arrived handcuffed and shackled from San Antonio in a military plane on February 5.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday halting US assistance to South Africa , citing concerns over a newly enacted land reform law that the White House says discriminates against the country’s white minority.“As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,” the White House stated in a summary of the order.The executive order references South Africa’s Expropriation Act , signed into law last month by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. As per the news agency AP, the law grants the government the authority to seize land in specific instances, such as when it is underutilised or when redistribution is deemed in the public interest, to correct historical injustices stemming from apartheid-era land dispossession.However, Trump’s administration claims the law “blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority Afrikaners” and could lead to land seizures without compensation, according to the news agency AFP.Trump’s close ally Elon Musk , who was born in South Africa, has been vocal about the Expropriation Act, calling it a threat to the country’s white minority. Musk has also clashed with the South African government over policies requiring major companies, such as his Starlink satellite internet service, to allocate 30% equity to historically disadvantaged groups, reported AFP.In addition to halting aid, Trump announced plans to establish a resettlement program for white South African farmers and their families, citing concerns over their safety and economic future. “The United States will promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination ,” the executive order states.The aid freeze also comes amid growing US-South Africa tensions on foreign policy. The executive order references South Africa’s role in bringing accusations of genocide against Israel before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a move that has deepened diplomatic rifts between Washington and Pretoria, as per AP.Additionally, US secretary of state Marco Rubio has announced that he will skip upcoming G20 talks in South Africa, accusing the country’s government of pursuing an “anti-American” agenda.The South African government has dismissed Trump’s claims as misinformation, arguing that the new land law does not authorize arbitrary confiscation but rather aims to correct deeply rooted economic disparities. The law remains a highly debated issue in South Africa, where most farmland is still owned by white citizens despite the end of apartheid three decades ago.",US President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday halting US assistance to South Africa.

BREAKING: Disappeared Alaska plane wreckage found

The Bering Air commuter plane carrying 10 people, which went missing over Alaska while en route to Nome, was found crashed on sea ice off the western coast of Alaska, authorities confirmed Friday.All nine passengers and the pilot were killed, as per the news agency AP.The US coast guard discovered the Cessna Caravan on Friday during an aerial search near its last known location, about 12 miles offshore and 30 miles southeast of Nome.Two rescue swimmers were deployed to examine the wreckage, as per AP.Radar data from the US Civil Air Patrol indicated the aircraft experienced a rapid loss of altitude and speed around 3:18 pm (local time) Thursday, though officials have not determined the cause.Lt Cmdr Benjamin McIntyre-Coble of the US Coast Guard stated that while the radar data suggests a sudden descent, the exact reason remains unknown. “What that event is, I can't speculate to,” he told reporters.Notably, no distress signals were received from the aircraft before the crash, as per AP.The Cessna Caravan, a single-engine turboprop, was at full passenger capacity, according to Bering Air’s fleet specifications. The flight, which departed Unalakleet at 2:37 pm, was a regularly scheduled commuter service.At the time of the incident, the National Weather Service reported light snow and fog, with temperatures around 17°F (-8.3°C). Western Alaska frequently experiences sudden snow squalls and high winds, particularly in winter, which can pose serious challenges for small aircraft.Search efforts were conducted by local, state, and federal agencies, with aircraft from Bering Air assisting in a grid-pattern search over the coastline. The Coast Guard's MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter first spotted the wreckage on sea ice and deployed rescue swimmers to investigate.Authorities have not yet confirmed whether the plane’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) was activated. The device, designed to send distress signals upon impact or water exposure, did not transmit any alerts to the Coast Guard.Nome, a historic Gold Rush town and the final stop of the Iditarod sledge dog race is now reeling from the tragedy. Prayer vigils were announced in honour of the victims, their families, and first responders involved in the search.Alaska's US Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, along with US Representative Nick Begich, expressed condolences. Begich posted on social media that he was ready to assist Governor Mike Dunleavy in supporting Nome and the affected families.With many remote communities lacking road access, air travel is essential for transportation across Alaska. However, harsh winter conditions and rugged terrain increase aviation risks.Bering Air, which serves 32 villages from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue, and Unalakleet, typically runs twice-daily flights to most destinations.The Alaska crash marks the third major US aviation mishap in eight days. On January 29, A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Washington, DC, killing 67 people. Another crash happened on January 31, when a medical transport plane crashed in Philadelphia, killing six passengers and one person on the ground.","Bering Air commuter plane carrying 10 people went missing over Alaska while en route to Nome.

"'You’re fired': Donald Trump revokes Joe Biden’s security clearance, cites ‘poor memory’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youre-fired-donald-trump-revokes-joe-bidens-security-clearance-cites-poor-memory/articleshow/118043701.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (left) and former US President Joe Biden (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he is revoking former President Joe Biden’s security clearance and ending his access to intelligence briefings, calling it a direct response to Biden’s decision to do the same to him in 2021.In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump stated, “There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s security clearances, and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings. He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the intelligence community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (me!) from accessing details on national security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents. The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from “poor memory” and, even in his “prime,” could not be trusted with sensitive information. I will always protect our national security — Joe, you’re fired. Make America Great Again!”Trump added that Biden had set the precedent by instructing the intelligence community to cut off Trump’s access after leaving office.Biden revoked Trump’s intelligence briefings in 2021, citing concerns over his “erratic behaviour” following the January 6 Capitol attack.At the time, Biden questioned whether Trump could be trusted with sensitive information and was quoted by CBS News saying, “What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”.Now, Trump is citing similar concerns over Biden’s cognitive abilities. In his post, Trump referenced special counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, which described the 82-year-old’s memory as “poor” and “faulty”.Trump’s decision follows a series of similar moves targeting officials who have opposed him. He previously revoked security clearances of more than 50 former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter suggesting the Hunter Biden laptop story had hallmarks of Russian disinformation. According to AP, he also rescinded security details for former officials, including ex-secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Dr Anthony Fauci.By US law, the sitting president has full discretion over whether former presidents receive intelligence briefings. While such access has traditionally been extended as a courtesy, Biden’s 2021 decision marked a break from precedent, which Trump is now following.","US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he is revoking former President Joe Biden’s security clearance and ending his access to intelligence briefings.

Trump reacted to the ruckus and said those who are doing it do not love the country. ""I see Maxine Waters , a low-life,"" Trump said.The Democrats demanded to meet education secretary Denise Carter but was not allowed to. “We are here to ask her, will you comply with an illegal executive order to shut down the Department of Education?” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said. “Although the president is determined to shut Congress out of the process, he will not. We will not allow it. We will not cede the responsibility for our future generations to one man, his ideology and his unelected lieutenants.”They were told by security that they should get an appointment for meeting Carter. “They have armed officers acting like we’re dangerous,” Florida 10th District representative Maxwell Frost said in a video he filmed standing outside the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education building. “A year ago, I’d be able to walk into this building and not be locked out.”“This is what they’re doing.

Ninety-six members of Congress, led by Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., wrote a letter to Carter requesting a meeting.

The US Senate confirmed Russell Vought on Thursday as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is involved in a dispute over freezing federal funding for aid programs.Vought was approved by a vote of 53-47 despite opposition from Democrats. Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer called him ""one of the most fringe and hard-right individuals the Senate has seen in a very long time.""The Thursday night vote followed a marathon effort by Democrats to block the nomination, during which they held the Senate floor with speeches for an entire day and night.

""A triple-header disaster for hardworking Americans.""Vought previously held the same position during President Donald Trump's first term.

Trump has continued to support that policy during his second term.Vought has already been a key figure in Trump's push to reshape the federal government, serving as one of the architects of Project 2025, a conservative plan for Trump’s second term.Vought returns to office as debate continues over an OMB order from last week that halted federal loans, grants, and other assistance.After the order was issued, OMB released a notice saying the freeze had been ""rescinded."" However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the order was still in effect and only the budget office’s memo had been withdrawn.A US district judge temporarily blocked the spending freeze last week and extended the ruling on Monday.

Donald Trump says policy of U.S. government is that there are only two genders - male and female

US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( Nasa ) employees have been directed to remove all pronouns from emails and other applications in an email sent to all staff members, NPR reported.The email was sent in response to executive orders from the Trump administration , including one titled ""Defending women from gender ideology and extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government."" This order was signed by President Trump on his first day in office and includes a directive for agencies to ""end the Federal funding of gender ideology.""The directives come after the White House's office of personnel management distributed instructions last week to department and agency heads, ordering them to remove references to gender ideology from all official materials, including emails. They were also ordered to take down any websites or other public-facing materials that reference gender identity, and ensure that bathrooms in federal buildings were designated for biological males and females.""In response to the Executive Orders, Nasa has disabled features in id.Nasa.gov and Teams that allows users to add pronouns in their display name in Microsoft Outlook and Teams,"" the email said, as per the NPR report. ""For users who have previously added pronouns to their display name, those pronouns will be automatically removed from the system this week.""The email also announced changes to email signatures. ""Nasa has adopted a uniform signature block for emails that are sent using any Nasa.gov email address. All users (civil servants, contractors, and grantees) must modify their signature block to follow the appropriate signature block… the signature block should not include additional embellishment.""This change is part of Nasa’s effort to comply with the White House's directives regarding content within government systems.According to 404 Media, an independent journalist-founded media website, Nasa employees were also instructed to remove specific terms from public-facing websites, including ""Indigenous people"" and references to women such as ""women in leadership.""","US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( Nasa ) employees have been directed to remove all pronouns from emails and other applications.

'Normalize Indian hate'



Who is Marko Elez?



What Elon Musk said about Marko Elez



JD Vance says 'bring him back'



Who is Katherine Long? Musk calls her cruel and disgusting



Vice president JD Vance weighed in on the resignation of Marko Elez , a 25-year-old staff of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, whose past social media posts spelt trouble for him and he quit the team. A Wall Street Journal first reported about the resignation and Elez's past posts advocating for racism and eugenics. This snowballed into a major controversy over the background of the youngsters hired by Elon Musk to scrutinize the federal departments -- one went viral for his online name 'Big balls' which was widely reported on television Thursday and Friday -- to Elon Musk's utter disbelief.Elez used @nullllptr as his account to put out problematic thoughts. The account was deleted in December but many posts were archived. “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. “Normalize Indian hate,” the account wrote the same month. The Wall Street Journal report said after they inquired about the account and its past posts, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Elez resigned from his role.The 25-year-old gained prominence after he got access to sensitive taxpayer information and systems the treasury department uses to process all the payments. Elez has not spoken amid the controversy. The computer science major from Rutgers University, as a sophomore, co-founded a company, Unimetrics.io, that aimed to connect high-schoolers with mentors who could help burnish their college applications. Elez worked at SpaceX, including on Starlink satellites and then he worked for X also before joining DOGE.Elon Musk ran a poll asking his followers if DOGE should rehire the “staffer who made inappropriate statements via a now deleted pseudonym.” Within hours, it had amassed more than 200,000 votes, almost 80% in favor of bringing Elez back.JD Vance said he obviously disagrees with some of Elez's posts, but he doesn't think social media activity should ruin his life. ""We shouldn’t reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever. So I say bring him back. If he’s a bad dude or a terrible member of the team, fire him for that,"" Vance said.As the DOGE drama unfolded, some conservative social media handles claimed that Katherine Long who wrote the Wall Street Journal article received USAID.

GENEVA: The United Nations warned Friday the civilian death toll was rising sharply in Sudan, blaming the warring parties for failing to protect non-combatants.The army, at war with the paramilitary rapid support forces since April 2023, has in recent weeks mounted a fierce assault to reclaim full control of the capital Khartoum.The UN human rights office OHCHR said it had documented at least 275 civilian deaths between January 31 and February 5, as a result of artillery shelling, air strikes and aerial drone attacks in Khartoum, and in North Darfur, South Darfur, North Kordofan and South Kordofan.The figures were more than three times the ""already high number"" of 89 recorded the previous week, it said.OHCHR typically acknowledges that the true death tolls are likely far higher than the numbers they manage to document.""The sharp increase in civilian deaths underscores the dire risks civilians face amid the continued failure by the parties to the conflict and their allies to protect civilians,"" said OHCHR spokesman Seif Magango.""Indiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians, must cease immediately,"" he said.""The Sudanese armed forces and the rapid support forces and their allied movements and militias must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human-rights defenders.""Since it erupted, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted 12 million and caused one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent memory.","U.N. warns civilian death toll is rising sharply in Sudan.

Federal prisons being used to detain people arrested in Trump's immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-prisons-being-used-to-detain-people-arrested-in-trumps-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/118030426.cms,"The control tower is seen through the razor wire inside the Camp VI detention facility in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba (Image credits: AP)

NEW YORK: President Donald Trump 's administration is using federal prisons to detain some people arrested in its immigration crackdown, the federal Bureau of Prisons said Friday, returning to a strategy that drew allegations of mistreatment during his first term.In a statement to The Associated Press, the prison agency said it is assisting US immigration and customs enforcement ""by housing detainees and will continue to support our law enforcement partners to fulfill the administration's policy objectives.""The bureau of prisons declined to say how many immigration detainees it is taking in, or which prison facilities are being used.""For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not comment on the legal status of an individual, nor do we specify the legal status of individuals assigned to any particular facility, including numbers and locations,"" the agency said.Three people familiar with the matter told the AP that federal jails in Los Angeles and Miami and a federal prison in Atlanta are being used for immigration detention. The people were not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity.An influx of immigration detainees could put yet more strain on federal prisons, which AP reporting revealed have been plagued by severe understaffing, violence and other problems.The bureau of prisons is the justice department's biggest agency with more than 30,000 employees, 122 facilities, 155,000 inmates and an annual budget of about $8 billion. In December, the agency said it was closing one prison and idling six prison camps to address ""significant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.""A message seeking comment was left for ICE.Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the US illegally. ICE currently has the budget to detain only about 41,000 people and the administration has not said how many detention beds it needs to achieve its goals.Many detainees are taken to ICE processing centers, privately operated detention facilities or local prisons and jails it contracts with.On Thursday, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said, a second flight of detainees landed at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Immigrant rights' groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent to Guantanamo Bay, saying the base should not be used as a ""legal black hole.""White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's January 20 inauguration. Of them, 461 were released for reasons that included medical conditions and lack of detention capacity, she said.ICE averaged 787 arrests a day from January 23 to January 31, compared to a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period ended September 30 during the Biden administration. ICE has stopped publishing daily arrests totals.In 2018, during Trump's first term, the bureau of prisons reached an agreement with ICE and customs and border protection to detain up to 1,600 immigrants at federal prison facilities in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Texas.Six immigrants detained under that arrangement at a medium-security federal prison in Victorville, California, sued Trump, then-attorney general Jeff Sessions, and immigration and prison officials, alleging ""punitive and inhumane"" treatment.The men, who were seeking asylum in the US, accused the bureau of prisons of providing inedible meals and spoiled milk, infringing on their ability to practice their religious faith, allowing only a few hours a week of recreation in the hot sun, and failing to provide adequate medical care.Last October, the American civil liberties union sued the bureau of prisons and immigration authorities under the freedom of information act for records related to the use of federal prisons to detain immigrants during Trump's first term. A conference in that case is scheduled for February 28.An ongoing AP investigation has exposed serious issues in the bureau of prisons, including rampant misconduct, sexual abuse by staff, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, and employees ill-equipped to respond to emergencies because of staffing limitations.Last week, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele offered to put US immigration detainees and other US prisoners in his country's massive CECOT prison, even American citizens and legal residents. In a post on X, Bukele said he was offering the US ""the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system"" in exchange for a ""relatively low"" fee.Trump says he was open to the idea, but acknowledged it could be legally problematic.""I'm just saying if we had a legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""I don't know if we do or not, we're looking at that right now.""","The federal Bureau of Prisons says it is assisting US immigration and customs enforcement ""by housing detainees"" The bureau of prisons declined to say how many immigration detainees it is taking in, or which prison facilities are being used.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said. ""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117886092,imgsize-725809,width-400,resizemode-4/117886092.jpg"
