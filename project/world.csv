'Sought and received permission': Dismissed CRPF jawan on marrying Pakistani woman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sought-and-received-permission-dismissed-crpf-jawan-on-marrying-pakistani-woman/articleshow/120865016.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan, Munir Ahmed , plans to legally contest his sacking over allegations of concealing his marriage to a Pakistani national. Ahmed claimed that he had received official permission for the marriage from CRPF headquarters in April 2024.""I initially came to know about my dismissal through media reports. I shortly received a letter from the CRPF informing me about the dismissal, which came as a shock to me and my family, as I had sought and received permission for my marriage to a Pakistani woman from the headquarters,"" Ahmed told news agency PTI.""I made the first correspondence on December 31, 2022, informing them of my wish to marry the Pakistani national, and I was asked to complete formalities like enclosing copies of the passport, marriage card, and affidavits. I submitted my affidavit, along with affidavits from my parents, sarpanch, and district development council member, through proper channels and finally got the go-ahead from the headquarters on April 30, 2024,"" he added.Ahmed, who was serving with the CRPF's 41st Battalion, was terminated without a formal inquiry under rules that allow immediate dismissal in sensitive matters, a move deemed necessary due to concerns over national security .A CRPF internal probe found that Ahmed had failed to report the marriage or the fact that his wife had overstayed her visa, triggering concerns over protocol breaches and potential security risks.According to CRPF spokesperson DIG M Dhinakaran, “Munir Ahmed has been dismissed from service with immediate effect for concealing his marriage to a Pakistani national and knowingly harbouring her beyond the validity of her visa. His actions were found to be in violation of service conduct and detrimental to national security.""Ahmed, however, claimed that he applied for a No Objection Certificate (NOC), but was told that such a provision was not available. He asserted that he had already completed the necessary formalities by informing the government about his marriage to a foreign national in accordance with the rules.""We got married online on May 24 last year through a video call. Subsequently, I submitted marriage pictures, 'nikkah' papers, and the marriage certificate to my 72 Battalion, where I was posted,"" Ahmed said.""When she came for the first time on February 28 on a 15-day visa, we applied for a Long-Term Visa in March itself and completed the necessary formalities, including an interview,"" he added.Ahmed further said that he returned to his duties at the end of his leave period and was asked to report to the battalion headquarters at Sunderbani on March 25. But on March 27, ""I was handed over a transfer order and posted with the 41st Battalion at Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) without being given the mandatory 15-day joining period.""I was given the order copy and relieved immediately, leaving me with no option but to join my duties at Bhopal, where I reported on March 29. I faced an interview with the commanding officer and his deputy on reaching there and also completed the documentation process, clearly mentioning my marriage to a Pakistani woman. I am hopeful of getting justice from the court of law,"" he added.",Munir Ahmed claims he had received official permission for the marriage from CRPF headquarters in April 2024.

"Pahalgam attack aftermath: Russia backs Simla Agreement, stresses bilateralism amid rising India-Pakistan tensions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-russia-backs-simla-agreement-stresses-bilateralism-amid-rising-india-pakistan-tensions/articleshow/120858815.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid Pakistan’s threat to suspend the 1972 Simla Agreement with India, Russia has backed the agreement saying the 2 countries should settle their disagreements bilaterally in line with the same and also the 1999 Lahore Declaration. This was mentioned in a Russian readout of a conversation that foreign minister Sergey Lavrov had with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar about the Pahalgam terrorist attack on Saturday.Jaishankar reiterated in his talks with Lavrov that perpetrators, planners and backers of the Pahalgam must be brought to justice. India sees Pakistan as having done little to respect the principles enshrined in the Simla Agreement but acknowledges its importance in underlining the significance of bilateralism in addressing disputes. The agreement has also been important for upholding the sanctity of the LoC, which resulted from the ceasefire of December 1971, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and use of peaceful means for resolving disputes. Pakistan has so far not issued a notification for putting the agreement in abeyance.According to Russian authorities, Lavrov and Jaishankar discussed issues related to Russia-India cooperation and the “aggravation of India-Pakistan relations following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”. The conversation followed President Vladimir Putin’s message to PM Narendra Modi last week that Russia expects the organisers and perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to face “deserved punishment”.“Sergey Lavrov called for settling disagreements between New Delhi and Islamabad on a bilateral basis by political and diplomatic means per the provisions of the Simla Agreement of 1972 and the Lahore Declaration of 1999. The ministers also discussed the schedule of upcoming contacts at the highest levels,’’ said the readout.Both sides also discussed Putin’s likely visit to India later this year for the annual India-Russia summit. Modi had visited Moscow for the summit last year and now it’s Putin’s turn to participate in the same meeting here. Modi may also have another meeting with Putin in China this year if he decides to participate in the upcoming SCO summit.The Russian side is currently working on a proposed meeting between Putin and US President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia for the Ukraine peace talks. Russia had earlier also invited PM Modi and other BRICS leaders to participate in the Victory Day celebrations on May 9. India initially wanted defence minister Rajnath Singh to go but he has had to cancel his visit because of the ongoing tensions with Pakistan and his deputy Sanjay Seth is now likely to represent India.",Pakistan has threatened to suspend the 1972 Simla Agreement with India.

"'Born to serve J&K police and my country': Cop, family spared deportation to Pakistan after HC steps in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/born-to-serve-jk-police-and-my-country-policeman-iftkhar-ali-family-spared-deportation-to-pakistan-after-hc-steps-in/articleshow/120847465.cms,"NEW DELHI: “I am born to serve the Jammu and Kashmir Police and my country, India,” said 45-year-old policeman Iftkhar Ali on Saturday, days after he and his eight siblings narrowly escaped being deported to Pakistan.The intervention of the Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh high court saved them from being sent across the border, a move Ali called a “conspiracy” rooted in false claims about their nationality.Ali, a resident of Salwah village in Mendhar sub-division near the Line of Control in Poonch district, has served in the police force for 27 years, earning multiple commendations for his dedication and bravery. “I have served all the wings in the police department over the past 27 years, which is evident from the scars on my body, and the citations and rewards which I have received from the department for shedding my sweat and blood for the country,” he said.Ali was among over two dozen individuals, mostly from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), who were issued 'Leave India' notices in Poonch, Rajouri, and Jammu districts last week. Many were taken to Punjab for deportation.However, after filing a petition, Ali and his siblings—Mohd Shafiq (60), Nashroon Akhter (56), Akseer Akhter (54), Mohd Shakoor (52), Naseem Akhter (50), Zulfqar Ali (49), Koser Parveen (47), and Shazia Tabasum (42) -- were brought back to their native village when the court stayed the deportation order.Justice Rahul Bharti, hearing their plea, stated, “(The) petitioners are not asked or forced to leave UT of Jammu & Kashmir. This direction is, however, subject to objections from the other side.” The Deputy Commissioner of Poonch has been asked to submit an affidavit detailing the petitioners’ property status, with the next hearing scheduled for May 20.Ali claims the deportation notice was triggered by a long-standing land dispute with his maternal uncle. “We have a land holding of nearly five hectares with another two hectares illegally usurped by my maternal uncle... The deportation notice is the outcome of that very dispute because they do not want to return our land,” he said.According to officials, Ali’s parents—Faqur Din and Fatima Bi—had crossed into PoK during the 1965 war and spent years in a Tralkhal refugee camp before returning to Salwah in 1983 with their children. Between 1997 and 2000, the J&K government admitted them as permanent residents, though their citizenship status remains pending with the Centre.The family’s ordeal came amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists. In response, the Centre announced strict measures, including downgrading diplomatic ties, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and ordering all Pakistanis on short-term visas to leave India by April 27.“We have a centuries-old history of being the bona fide residents of Salwah with both our parents and other ancestors buried in the village… the notice came as a shocker to our family comprising more than 200 members, including some serving in the Army,” Ali said. He currently serves in Katra, the base camp for pilgrims visiting the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine, and lives with his wife and three children aged 6 to 11.Despite the trauma, Ali expressed confidence in India’s leadership. He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, saying, “I am confident that the country's leadership will not allow [my] handing over to the 'enemy nation' on the 'mere conspiracy' that they belong to the part of J&K which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan.”“The most painful moment of my life was when I was told that I did not belong to this country,” he recalled. “I do not belong to Pakistan and nobody is there for me. I belong to India and this is my country. I love the police from the core of my heart and I am ready to sacrifice my life for the country.”Ali also expressed gratitude to his legal team and socio-political activist Safeer Choudhary, who supported the family during the crisis. “I also come from Mendhar and I know they have a genuine case so I came forward on humanitarian grounds to mobilise support in their favour so that they are not deported to Pakistan,” Choudhary said.","Iftkhar Ali and his eight siblings narrowly escaped being deported to Pakistan. The Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh high court saved them from being sent across the border.

Farooq Abdullah links Pahalgam attack to local support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-abdullah-links-pahalgam-attack-to-local-support/articleshow/120858237.cms,"Poll Do you think that remarks made by political leaders can influence public perception of Kashmiris? No, people form their opinions independently. Yes, they can significantly impact views.

SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah said Saturday the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack that left 26 people dead could not have taken place without local assistance. “I don’t think these things can happen unless someone supports them,” he said.Abdullah also reiterated his party’s longstanding opposition to Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying the agreement has harmed the region’s interests and must be reviewed.His comments about local support in the Pahalgam attack drew criticism from PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti. She called his remarks “deeply disturbing” and “regrettable”.“As a senior leader, that too as a Kashmiri, his statement risks fuelling divisive narratives providing ammunition to certain media channels to further stereotype & stigmatise Kashmiris and Muslims,” Mufti said in a post on X. “This isn’t only misleading but fatal at a time when students and traders from J&K are already facing heightened vulnerability and attacks.”NC pushed back against Mufti’s interpretation of the remarks. Party chief spokesman Tanvir Sadiq accused her of twisting Abdullah’s words and demanded an apology.“It’s shocking that someone who has served as CM would stoop this low. Farooq Abdullah never mentioned ‘Kashmiris’ or ‘locals’,” Sadiq said in a statement. “At a time when we’re trying to protect Kashmiri students, traders, and families across India, it’s shameful to misrepresent his words and endanger them further.”Abdullah visited the family of Syed Adil Hussain Shah, the pony handler killed in the attack, at Hapatnar in Pahalgam. He welcomed central govt’s announcement to suspend the water treaty with Pakistan and urged govt to divert Chenab water to Jammu and build power infrastructure on Jhelum in Kashmir.“We do not want their (Pakistan's) water supply to be stopped, but we have a right on our rivers. Today if you go to Jammu, you see there is a huge shortage of water,” he said.Abdullah recalled that his government had tried to draw water from the Chenab to Jammu but was blocked by the World Bank under IWT restrictions. “Today is the opportunity for us to divert this water from there to Jammu,” he said.“In Kashmir we are deprived of electricity. We can generate thousands of megawatts,” he added, calling on the government to build hydropower infrastructure on the Jhelum.Referring to the Pahalgam attack, Abdullah said: “They (terrorists) have lost it. It has been proven today that we are not going to get scared. Kashmir was and will always be a part of India. People want terrorism to finish.”",National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah said the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack that left 26 people dead could not have taken place without local assistance.

'Will take firm & decisive action against terrorists': PM Modi on Pahalgam attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-take-firm-decisive-action-against-terrorists-pm-modi-on-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120858701.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is committed to taking “firm and decisive” action against the terrorists who perpetrated the Pahalgam attack and those who support them, said PM Narendra Modi amid repeated calls by the global community for restraint and de-escalation and as tensions soar with Pakistan. After a bilateral meeting with visiting Angola President João Manuel Lourenço, Modi said both leaders agreed that terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity.Modi delivered his media statement after the meeting in Hindi but switched over to English while talking about the April 22 attack and India’s resolve for decisive action against the perpetrators. The PM had done the same 2 days after the attack while speaking in Madhubani in Bihar where he, in his first response to the tourist massacre, pledged to identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers.Modi’s remarks on the Pahalgam attack, particularly about action against those who support terrorists, are significant as these suggest India hasn’t given up on the military option for pursuing those who perpetrated the attack and their backers. Lourenço, who currently holds the chairmanship of the African Union, also strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed solidarity with the Indian people.As the government weighs punitive measures against Pakistan for its role in the attack, it has come under some serious pressure from friends and partners like the US, EU and Gulf countries to avoid any escalation and resolve the cross-border terrorism issue with Pakistan diplomatically.Modi was speaking days after US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate and work for peace in South Asia. His counterpart S Jaishankar had responded by saying that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Rubio’s comments were followed by remarks by US Vice President JD Vance that India’s response to the attack should not lead to any broader regional conflict. Unlike Rubio though, Vance seemed to throw a noose around Pakistan’s neck by explicitly asking it to work with India “to the extent that they are responsible” and ensure that the terrorists “sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down”. The state department too said Modi had full support of the US on terrorism, in comments apparently meant to assure India that Washington is not tone-deaf to India’s anxieties about Pakistan’s backing of terrorists.Modi was also speaking a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh cancelled his visit to Moscow for Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on May 9.“I thanked President Lourenço and the people of Angola for their condolences on the loss of lives in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam. India is committed to taking firm and decisive action against the terrorists and those who support them. We thank Angola for their support in our fight against cross-border terrorism,’’ said the PM, while announcing an expansion of the energy partnership with the southwestern African country that is an important supplier of oil and gas to India. Modi also announced a $ 200 million defence credit line for the modernization of Angola’s armed forces.","India committed to taking ‘firm and decisive’ action against the terrorists who perpetrated the Pahalgam attack and those who support them, said PM Narendra Modi.

Police response and current situation

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions following the murder of Hindutva activist Suhas Shetty, the Mangaluru Police have imposed a prohibitory order across the city from Friday until May 6. Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.On Thursday evening, around 8:30 pm, Suhas Shetty was traveling with five associates—Sanjay, Prajwal, Anvith, Latheesh, and Shashank—when their vehicle was intercepted near Kinnipadavu Cross by a group of assailants.The attackers, numbering around six, were traveling in a Swift car and a pickup truck. They ambushed Shetty and his group, assaulting him with deadly weapons, inflicting severe injuries.Despite being rushed to AJ Hospital, Shetty succumbed to his wounds. The police have since registered a murder case and are actively working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.Shetty was a well-known rowdy sheeter with five criminal cases—four in Mangaluru City and one in Dakshina Kannada district.Given Shetty's affiliations, his murder is considered a sensitive issue, prompting the police to launch a manhunt to locate the perpetrators.Notably, he was one of the accused in the 2022 murder of Mohammed Fazil, a 23-year-old resident of Mangalapete in Katipalla. Fazil's killing had already stirred significant tensions across the coastal region.In response to the incident, police issued the prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, enforced across the entire Mangaluru City Police jurisdiction.City police commissioner Anupam Agrawal, who also serves as the additional district magistrate, announced that public gatherings, meetings, processions, sloganeering, and the carrying of items that could be used as weapons are prohibited during this period. The measure aims to prevent any potential flare-ups and maintain public order in the aftermath of the murder.Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack on Shetty was premeditated, though the exact motive remains unclear. The police have confirmed that investigations are ongoing.Following the murder, Bajrang Dal had called for a city bandh late on Thursday night, and some miscreants attempted to pelt stones at buses. The police have since increased security in the area, ensuring adequate deployment and continuous patrols to monitor the situation. ""We have registered a murder case, and teams are working on it. It is too early to say what the motive was behind the murder. We have imposed prohibitory orders to ensure peace in the city,"" Commissioner Agrawal stated.","Suhas Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.

Chaos at FBI headquarters; Kash Patel works from Las Vegas home remotely



Senate Democrats call for probe into Patel's usage of jets



A former FBI official on MSNBC's Morning Joe program commented that FBI director Kash Patel, despite the fear that was spread ahead of his confirmation that he would dismantle the system if he became the FBI director, has surprisingly taken a backseat.Former FBI counter-intelligence official Frank Figliuzzi said Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs and less at the office, but people are not complaining because they think things would have been bad, had he been trying to run them, given his experience or the lack of it.""Yeah well, reportedly, he's been visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building,"" Figliuzzi replied. ""And there are reports that daily briefings to him have been changed from every day to maybe twice weekly. """"So this is both a blessing and a curse, because if you, if he's, really trying to run things without his experience, without any experience level, things could be bad. If he's not plugged in, things could be bad. But he's allowing agents to run things so we don't know where this is going.""Figliuzzi said people tell him that the FBI headquarters is chaos as nobody is clued in about the everyday activities and Kash Patel spends a lot of his time at his home in Las Vegas. "" People don't know what's happening from day to day. There's also been reporting, I believe, from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, that Patel spent a lot of his time at his home in Las Vegas –– he's been sort of working remotely for at least part of the week.""Some Senate Democrats have called for a probe into Patel's use of FBI's private fleet of jets for his personal purposes, including trips to visit his girlfriend and attend hockey games and other sporting events.

Nothing. You have to have the right vision,” Trump told graduates, according to Mediaite.In a rare moment of backhanded praise for Musk, Trump added, “If you look at some of these internet people, I know so many of them. Elon is so terrific. But I know now all of them. You know, they all hated me in my first term, and now they’re kissing my a**.”He doubled down, “It’s true. All of them. It’s true.”Trump used the moment to lay out his philosophy on success, “Progress never comes from those satisfied with the failures of a broken system. It comes from those who wanna fix the broken system, and you’ll make the bigger money, you’ll make more success by acting that way. The other way may be more secure, but if you wanna go to the top, you’re just never gonna do it unless you break the system.”Shifting from billionaires to himself, Trump reminded the audience of his outsider credentials, “It’s amazing. It’s nicer this way. Now in the first, you know, they didn’t know what happened because I won an election that, you know, there was never a businessman that won a presidential election. Out of 100%, 8% were generals and 92% were politicians. Not even admirals. Just generals.”Trump’s remarks sparked a flurry of reactions online. One user wrote, “This guy has no decency,” while another added, “Elon sucks. H1B visas. Anti-Americans.” A third chimed in sarcastically: “Very presidential of him.” A fourth warned, “Oh Donald, you’ll regret those words.”The tension between Trump and Musk has been brewing for years. In 2022, Musk tweeted that Trump was too old to run again and should “hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.” Musk clarified, “I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat… Dems should also call off the attack, don’t make it so that Trump’s only way to survive is to regain the Presidency.”Trump, in turn, claimed that Musk would have “gotten on his knees and begged” for help when he first visited the White House.This isn’t the first time Trump has claimed others were pleading with him.

Saquon Barkley’s golf day with Donald Trump triggers mixed reactions

Fiancée Anna Congdon’s old tweets resurface and stir more backlash

Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has found himself at the center of controversy following a high-profile weekend with former President Donald Trump and the resurfacing of old, offensive tweets by his fiancée, Anna Congdon. The firestorm comes during what should have been a celebratory moment: the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory visit to the White House.Just days before the team’s scheduled visit to the White House, Barkley joined Trump for a round of golf at the former president’s Bedminster, N.J. club. Barkley even flew to Washington aboard Air Force One with Trump, with cameras capturing them stepping off Marine One together. Trump joked, “I wanted to race him, but I decided not to do it,” calling the Pro Bowl athlete “a nice guy.”But the images sparked online outrage, especially given the political tension surrounding Trump. Critics accused Barkley of aligning himself with a divisive figure right before a non-partisan team event.Barkley responded directly on social media, writing: “Get out of my mentions with all this politics. Some people are really upset ’cause I played golf and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT… Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand.” He also pointed out that he had previously golfed with Barack Obama, emphasizing his stance on respecting the presidency, not the politics.While Barkley was defending his Trump appearance, his fiancée, Anna Congdon, came under fire for a different reason. Social media users resurfaced tweets she made as a teenager in 2012 and 2013 that contained racial slurs and insensitive language, including casual use of the N-word. The tweets drew heavy criticism, especially since Congdon and Barkley have a biracial child.Though the posts were over a decade old, many questioned whether they reflected deeper views. Neither Congdon nor Barkley has commented on the matter publicly, but the timing of the leak — just ahead of the Super Bowl — raised suspicion about the motives behind it.The Eagles' visit to the White House was notable not just for Barkley's presence, but also for the absence of key players, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith. While the official explanation was “scheduling conflicts,” the silent boycott echoed past tensions with Trump-era politics.Also Read: “Turning sports into reality TV”: Kelly Stafford urges balance between public curiosity and privacy in Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s relationship Ultimately, Barkley’s actions and the resurfaced tweets have reignited debate over how athletes engage with politics and public figures — and whether personal gestures can ever truly be separated from public perception.",Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has found himself at the center of controversy following a high-profile weekend with former President Donald Trump.

I must say we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a place called New York who is very good. So we’ll see what happens.” Trump was referring to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, whom the president on May 1 named to serve on the White House’s newly created Religious Liberty Commission. At a Rose Garden event Thursday, Trump remarked about the commission, “They say separation between church and state… I said, ‘All right, let’s forget about that for one time.’”","Donald Trump does not identify as a Catholic and calls himself a non- denominational Christian.

'One for the ages'

'Full responsibility'

Sydney, May 04, 2025 -Australia's left-leaning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese basked Sunday in his landslide election win, promising a ""disciplined, orderly"" government to confront cost-of-living pain and tariff turmoil.Residents clapped as the 62-year-old and his fiancee Jodie Haydon visited his old inner Sydney haunt, Cafe Italia, surrounded by a crowd of jostling photographers and TV journalists.Albanese's Labor Party is on course to win at least 82 seats in the 150-member parliament, partial results showed.Opposition leader Peter Dutton's conservative Liberal-National coalition had just 36 seats, and other parties 12. Another 20 seats were still in doubt.""We will be a disciplined, orderly government in our second term,"" Albanese said, after scooping ice cream for journalists in a cafe he used to visit with his mum.""She would be very proud,"" Albanese said of his late, single mother Maryanne, who raised him in a modest government-subsidised Sydney flat.""We've been given a great honour of serving the Australian people, and we don't take it for granted, and we'll work hard each and every day,"" he said.Dutton, a hard-nosed former policeman -- who critics tagged ""Trump-lite"" for policies that included slashing the civil service -- endured the rare humiliation of losing his own seat.US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, may not have been the biggest factor in the Labor Party victory -- but analysts said they helped.""If we want to understand why a good chunk of the electorate has changed across the election campaign over the last couple of months, I think that's the biggest thing,"" said Henry Maher, a politics lecturer at the University of Sydney.""In times of instability, we expect people to go back to a kind of steady incumbent.""The scale of Albanese's win took his own party by surprise.""It's still sinking in,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.""This was beyond even our most optimistic expectations. It was a history-making night. It was one for the ages,"" Chalmers told national broadcaster ABC.But the win came with ""healthy helpings of humility"", he said, because under-pressure Australians want ""stability in uncertain times"".Albanese has promised to embrace renewable energy, cut taxes, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system.Dutton wanted to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power.Before the first vote was even counted, speculation was mounting over whether the 54-year-old opposition leader could survive an election loss.""We didn't do well enough during this campaign. That much is obvious tonight and I accept full responsibility,"" Dutton told supporters in a concession speech.Economic concerns have dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol.""The cost of living -- it's extremely high at the moment... Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,"" human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane.The 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair but there were moments of unscripted levity.Albanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football.Leaders around the world congratulated Albanese on his triumph.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he hoped to ""promote freedom and stability in the Indo-Pacific"" with Australia, a ""valued ally, partner, and friend of the United States"".An unnamed Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Beijing was ""ready to work"" with Australia's government.Albanese said he had spoken with the prime ministers of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, and received ""some good text messages"" from leaders in Britain, France, ""and a range of others"".The premier said he planned to speak with the leaders of Indonesia and Ukraine, promising to back Kyiv against Russia's invasion: ""That's my government's position.

Huge victory for President Trump and Article II,"" Lake wrote.""Turns out the District Court judge will not be able to manage the agency as he seemed to want to.""The president has questioned why the broadcaster that reaches millions of weekly listeners and viewers worldwide is not promoting his administration's viewpoint, bristling at the editorial ""firewall"" that let the service operate independently.In an April letter to lawmakers, several former directors of VOA, nominated across party lines over the decades, pressed Congress to intervene to restore the broadcaster, after a judge said Trump's shutdown violated the law.May 3 is World Press Freedom Day , which celebrates the role of a free press and highlights the challenges for journalism around the globe.","A US appellate court on Saturday ruled against allowing Voice of America staff to return to work.

TOKYO: Tokyo has lodged a protest against Beijing after a Chinese helicopter ""violated"" Japan 's airspace and four vessles entered its territorial waters around disputed islands.The islands in the East China Sea -- known as the Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan -- are claimed by Beijing but administered by Tokyo and are a frequent hotspot in bilateral tensions.The Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement released late Saturday that its vice minister lodged ""a strong protest"" with the Chinese ambassador to Japan ""over the intrusion of four China Coast Guard vessels into Japan's territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands"" on the same day.The vice minister also protested ""the violation of Japan's territorial airspace by a helicopter launched from one of the China Coast Guard vessels, strongly urging (China) to ensure that similar acts do not recur"".Japan's defence ministry said the helicopter flew within Japanese airspace for about 15 minutes on Saturday near the Senkaku islands.""The Self-Defence Forces responded by scrambling fighter jets,"" the ministry said.Public broadcaster NHK and other local media reported that this is the first time a Chinese government helicopter violated the Japanese airspace off the disputed islands.On the same day, China's coast guard announced it had used a helicopter to ""expel"" a Japanese airplane from airspace around the disputed islands.Liu Dejun, spokesman for China's coast guard, said a Japanese civilian aircraft ""illegally entered"" the airspace of the islands at 11:19 am (GMT 0219) and left five minutes later.Beijing frequently announces it has driven Japanese vessels and aircraft away from the islands, but Japanese officials have told AFP that Chinese authorities sometimes announce expulsions when none have occurred.Unnamed Japanese officials told local media that Beijing was possibly reacting to a small Japanese civilian aircraft flying near the islands.Chinese and Japanese patrol vessels in the East China Sea have routinely staged dangerous face-offs around disputed islands.Tensions between China and other claimants to parts of the East and South China Seas has driven Japan to deepen ties with the Philippines and United States.","Japan protests China's airspace 'violation' near disputed islands.

Harris won't be able to be back home, predicts Brazilian psychic Athos Salome



Team Harry vs Team King Charles



Prince Harry gave an explosive interview to the BBC, in which he said he wanted to bury the hatchet with the royal family and that he did not nurse any emotional wound. He revealed that he does not talk to his father, confirming what has long been in speculation -- that he had wanted to get back. But the interview did much damage to his prospects of returning home as it came out of the blue after he lost the legal case of security in the UK.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle resigned from their royal duties in 2020 and left the UK to start a new life in California. Their main grievance was the prying family that choked them like they did to his mother, Princess Diana. His security cover in the UK was withdrawn as a result, but Harry contested that and now he has lost the case. This means if Harry, Meghan and their children come to the UK, they are not under Royal security.The loss converted into a sudden interview that stunned the world as it was clear that the sit-down was being planned in the shadows and Prince Harry was ready to take the Royal Family down once again in public.Psychic Athos Salome , referred to as the ' Living Nostradamus ', told The SUN that Harry will leave California as he feels trapped there though he would not be back in Buckingham, his new home will be a third country.A silent rapprochement with King Charles in possible but it will be only between the fathers and the son. Prince William will remain distant and resentful.After Prince Harry's interview, social media users got divided between team Harry and team Charles -- sparring at the new Royal feud. King Charles was slammed as a pathetic father, after being a pathetic husband to Princess Diana, as Harry revealed that his father does not speak to him. Team King, on the other hand, pilloried Harry for his attack on his family.","Prince Harry gave an explosive interview to the BBC, in which he said he wanted to bury the hatchet with the royal family.

A small aircraft crashed into a residential area in Simi Valley, California, on Saturday afternoon, killing one person aboard. The incident took place around 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles in the Wood Ranch community, according to local authorities, reported news agency Associated Press.The aircraft, a Van’s RV-10, went down between two houses. Smoke was seen rising from the roof of one of the homes. Fire crews arrived shortly after the crash, managing to evacuate residents safely. The Ventura County Fire Department confirmed that although the homes were damaged by both the crash and the resulting fire, no injuries were reported among the residents.Authorities have not yet released any information about the pilot or the possible cause of the crash. The Van’s RV-10 is known as a home-built plane that comes in kit form and has previously been involved in other crashes. In January, a similar model crashed in Fullerton, killing a father and daughter and injuring 19 others.","Small aircraft crashes into residential area in Simi Valley, California.

MEXICO CITY: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it.Her remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the US military in combating drug cartels in Mexico.""He said, 'How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.' And you know what I said to him? 'No, President Trump.'""She added: ""Sovereignty is not for sale.

I’d be problem solving in public. I’m not a martyr.”Craig Robinson, her brother and co-host of the In Michelle Obama (IMO) podcast, chimed in with humor: “I’d be doing a podcast with Barack Obama.”The rumors aren’t new. Whispers of a marital rift first surged after Michelle skipped Donald Trump’s second inauguration—fueling theories that her absence signaled deeper trouble at home.But on the April 23 episode of IMO, she set the record straight.“People couldn’t believe that I was saying no for any other reason. They had to assume that my marriage was falling apart,” Michelle explained. “I’m here really trying to own my life… It took everything in my power to not do the thing that was ‘right’ but to do the thing that was right for me.”She later told Bartlett that skipping the event was part of shedding the pressure of always being the model figure.“I think I just told myself, ‘I think I’ve done enough of that,’ and if I haven’t, then I never will. It’ll never be enough. So let me start now.”Despite the buzz, Michelle described her relationship with Barack as grounded in complementary differences.“When I met Barack Obama, he showed up in my life as the opposite of a box checker… He did nothing by the book. He was brilliant and interesting.”The Obamas, married since 1992, are parents to Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23.

Rubio blamed the Biden administration for failing to protect Jewish students during recent unrest on campuses. “They allowed campus buildings to be overrun by violent thugs,” he wrote.Citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, Rubio said student visa holders found to support or endorse terrorist groups would be deemed inadmissible. The policy builds on intelligence-sharing with law enforcement to identify and cancel such visas immediately.Rubio also tied the new rule to broader reforms under Trump’s second term. In his 100-day statement, he claimed the State Department had transformed into “a leaner machine” by dismantling offices like the Global Engagement Center, cutting funding to NGOs, and streamlining operations to eliminate bureaucracy.Additional executive actions include requiring US universities to disclose all foreign funding sources or risk losing federal support, measures aimed squarely at international students and institutions seen as sympathetic to America’s adversaries.Rubio defended the changes as a necessity for national security. “The time of contemptuously taking advantage of our nation’s generosity ends,” he wrote.The new policy coincides with Trump’s broader America First strategy abroad, including diplomatic efforts to expel China from managing the Panama Canal, pressuring NATO allies to increase defense spending, and reclassifying the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization.Legal resistance is already underway. Several visa revocations have been reversed in court, and more challenges are expected. Civil liberties groups argue the policy could violate due process and chill free speech.Secretary Rubio was sworn in on January 21, 2025. “With an impending reorganization that will unleash the Department’s talent from the ground-up,” he concluded, “the State Department is set to continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety, security and prosperity of the American people.”",The new policy was unveiled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the April 30 edition of the State Department newsletter.

Poll Should India accept Pakistan's offer for a neutral international investigation into the Pahalgam incident? No, it's unnecessary. Yes, it would promote transparency.

Even in a country where the military has always loomed over governance, this is the first time that the ISI head will also officiate as NSA.The appointment, effective immediately, comes less than 10 days after the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam that put Pakistan in India’s crosshairs and triggered a diplomatic firestorm.Lt Gen Malik, who took over as ISI chief in Sept 2024, will advise PM Shehbaz Sharif on national security and foreign policy while steering Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus. The dual role, announced via a cabinet division notification, is widely seen as a power grab by the military, sidelining the civilian leadership at a time of reckoning.Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Pahalgam attack – 26 people were killed – and calls for a “neutral” probe have done little to placate India.While Malik’s elevation amplifies ISI’s influence in shaping Pakistan’s response, both militarily and politically, critics argue this move exposes the fragility of Pakistan’s civilian governance.“Appointing the ISI chief as NSA hands the military a blank check to dictate terms, not just on security but in backchannel talks with India,” said a former diplomat.Malik’s track record as adjutant general, where he oversaw the crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan’s supporters during the 2023 riots, suggests a hardline approach. His closeness to Army chief Gen Asim Munir, who handpicked him for the ISI role, has fuelled concerns of a military-driven agenda.Posts on X reflect public unease, with some calling it a step toward a “soft coup”, while others see it as a pragmatic response to India’s stand.The consolidation of power in Malik’s hands risks alienating civilian stakeholders and complicating diplomacy, especially after PM Narendra Modi vowed “complete operational freedom” for India’s armed forces.With the NSA post vacant since April 2022, Malik’s appointment fills a strategic void but raises questions about whether Pakistan’s military is preparing for war, negotiation, or both.","Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik appointed as the country’s national security adviser.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

Poll Do you support the proposals made by the Women's Affairs Reform Commission? No, they go against Islamic principles. Yes, they are necessary for gender equality.

DHAKA: Radical Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh has warned chief adviser Muhammad Yunus that he will be treated like deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina if the interim govt pushes ahead with implementing ""anti-Islamic"" proposals made by the Women's Affairs Reform Commission. Hefazat leaders also condemned the proposals as being in direct conflict with the Quran and Sunnah. Meanwhile, Khelafat Majlis also called for the abolition of the Commission. ""This is against the Quran and Sunnah and threatens the religious identity of Muslims,"" said secretary general Ahmad Abdul Quader.Hefazat's warning came during nationwide protests triggered by the Commission's recent report, which Hefazat claims goes against Islamic law . Speaking at a protest site in Narayanganj on Friday, Hefazat joint secretary general Mamunul Haque said, ""We welcomed five of the six reform commissions, but the proposals from the Women's Affairs Reform Commission are shocking. They blame religious and social norms for gender discrimination, which is a clear rejection of Islamic law."" Referring to Yunus, Haque said, ""We have shown him respect, but if he insists on pushing this agenda, we will be compelled to treat him no differently than Sheikh Hasina.""",Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh has warned chief adviser Muhammad Yunus that he will be treated like deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
