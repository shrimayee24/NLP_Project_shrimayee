Thiruvananthapuram: A couple and their two sons were found dead at their home in Vakkom, in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram district, on Tuesday. Police suspected a suicide pact, with a preliminary inquiry suggesting a financial crisis as the possible trigger.The deceased were identified as Anil Kumar (55), his wife Sheeja (50), and their sons, Ashwin (25) and Akash (22). Anil worked as a senior clerk at Vakkom Service Cooperative Bank while Sheeja was a daily-wage worker at the legislative assembly. Ashwin had completed BCom and was searching for a job, while Akash was an engineering student in Chirayinkeezhu. Sheeja often spoke about the family's mounting debts, said ward member Santhamma S. The financial strain began after they took a large bank loan to renovate a house purchased some years ago. ""Matters worsened in 2019 when Ashwin was seriously injured in an accident, resulting in multiple fractures. He was hospitalised for six months, and the family incurred heavy medical expenses, adding to their already growing debt,"" Santhamma said.","The deceased were identified as Anil Kumar (55), his wife Sheeja (50), and their sons, Ashwin (25) and Akash (22) Police suspected a suicide pact, with a preliminary inquiry suggesting a financial crisis as the possible trigger.

Calcutta HC: Pet owners must ensure animals don’t harm others,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-pet-owners-must-ensure-animals-dont-harm-others/articleshow/121449979.cms,"Calcutta HC

KOLKATA: Pet owners must ensure their animals do not harm others, Calcutta high court has said in a recent order, turning down a man's plea to quash a criminal case pertaining to a dog attack on a neighbour.""The potential gravity of a dog attack on a human, capable of causing serious injury or even posing a threat to life, cannot be overstated. Therefore, a pet owner is undeniably duty-bound to exercise a certain degree of care and take sufficient steps to prevent their pet from causing harm,"" Justice Uday Kumar said in his order on May 23.The pet owner from Sonarpur, on Kolkata's outskirts, was charged under Section 289 of IPC, pertaining to ""negligent conduct with respect to animals"". This followed a complaint from the neighbour alleging he was attacked by 10-12 of the man's pet dogs on the terrace of their apartment building in 2022, leading to injuries.In his HC plea, the pet owner said the charges were based on ""falsehood and inaccuracies"". He claimed he had only one dog and that a medical report of the complainant mentioned there was ""no obvious external injury"".But Justice Kumar cited IPC Section 289 to say it imposed a ""duty on the owner or possessor of an animal"" to take adequate measures to prevent any probable danger to human life or grievous hurt to others.The judge pointed out that the section specifically uses the words ""knowingly or negligently omits"", emphasising either actual knowledge of the animal's harmful propensity or a lack of due care in its management.While the police chargesheet mentioned that ""10-12 dogs"" belonged to the accused, the pet owner disputed it, highlighting the absence of documentary and photographic evidence. Justice Kumar held that the accused could highlight these lapses during trial, adding the HC could not assume ""the role of a fact-finding authority"".""Even if the injury was not externally obvious, being attacked by 10-12 dogs and falling on a roof could potentially lead to internal injuries, non-visible bruises, or psychological trauma. Furthermore, the complaint highlights a broader concern regarding the practice of keeping 'many dogs...unchained on the roof of a housing (complex)', which, if true, could indeed pose a threat to human life, regardless of immediate physical injury,"" the judge observed.","Calcutta high court turns down a man's plea to quash a criminal case pertaining to a dog attack on a neighbour.

Rs 15 crore debt pushed Praveen into deep distress

PANCHKULA: Six members of a family were found dead inside a parked car late Monday night in Sector 27 of Haryana's Panchkula, while a seventh died hours later in a hospital. Police said Praveen Mittal, 42, a debt-ridden businessman, left suicide notes taking full responsibility for the deaths.Bodies of Praveen's wife Reena (40), parents Deshraj and Bimla (60+), son Hardik (13), and twin daughters Dilasha and Dhruvita (11) were discovered by residents after the family allegedly took poison in a car. Praveen, found semi-conscious outside the car, told a bystander before collapsing: ""We are in debt... no relative helped us."" He died in hospital. Police are treating the deaths as a case of mass suicide, pending toxicology confirmation.ACP Vikram Nehra said cops found two suicide notes, allegedly written by Praveen, saying he had gone bankrupt & preferred his cousin in Ludhiana to perform last rites.A sodium nitrate-based chemical, empty water bottles, and a soft drink were found in the vehicle. Lab results are pending.Praveen, originally from Hisar's Barwala, had suffered repeated financial failures - from a shuttered scrap unit in Baddi to a collapsed tour and travel business in Dehradun.Loans totalling around Rs 12-15 crore had pushed him into deep distress, relatives said. He also worked with an NGO and later became a driver in Panchkula.According to Dehradun police, Praveen lived in Kaulagarh for four years before shifting to Chandigarh seven months ago. He had borrowed a car from Gambhir Singh Negi, who said he financed the vehicle in his own name at Mittal's request, with the latter promising to pay EMIs.Neighbours and locals were shocked. ""The girls were very cute. They used to walk in the park,"" said Manish Chaudhary, who rented a two-room set in Saketri to the family for Rs 8,000 a month. ""He told me Monday morning they were going out of station for three days.""Police said the family had attended a Bageshwar Dham gathering earlier that day in Sector 5 and were seen parked in the area by locals, who initially assumed they were resting due to lack of hotel accommodation.Relatives described Praveen as withdrawn and financially burdened. Cousin Ankit Mittal recalled long stretches without contact and multiple failed attempts at business recovery. Praveen's ties with in-laws were strained, leading him to exclude his father-in-law from last rites in his final note.Praveen's brother Jitender, a garment trader in Panchkula, is assisting police with the investigation.Sociologist and former Panjab University professor Rajesh Gill called the tragedy a reflection of societal isolation. ""There's no support system now - no extended family, no neighbourhood to fall back on,"" she said.

IMPHAL: Protesters locked up two central government offices in Imphal Tuesday amid an escalating standoff over forced concealment of the word ""Manipur"" on a government bus headed to a hill festival last week. The restive state has been under President's rule since February.Activists of COCOMI, an umbrella body of Meitei groups, stormed the chief electoral officer's office at Lamphelpat and asked the staff to leave before locking the main gate. They then shut down an office of the Geological Survey of India, located a few kilometres away, raising slogans like ""apologise or leave Manipur"" against governor AK Bhalla. The activists outnumbered security personnel.The protests began when a Manipur State Transport bus ferrying journalists to the Shirui Lily Festival in Ukhrul district was allegedly stopped at the Gwaltabi checkpoint on May 20 and ordered to hide 'Manipur' on the windshield.COCOMI had on Monday adopted a resolution vowing to close central offices, sparing only essential services like healthcare, education, sports and banking.On Tuesday, some organisations organised a human chain demanding an apology from the governor. Similar protests were held in Bishnupur district.

US halts new student visa interviews amid plans for social media screening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-halts-new-student-visa-interviews-amid-plans-for-social-media-screening/articleshow/121445425.cms,"Trump administration orders pause on student visa interviews worldwide





The United States has temporarily stopped scheduling new student visa interviews at embassies across the globe.The Trump administration is getting ready to bring in stricter rules on checking social media accounts of foreign students, leaving many international applicants worried about their future in the US.The order was issued via a diplomatic cable sent on Tuesday by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued,” Rubio wrote. According to the cable, more detailed instructions are expected soon. Interviews already booked will continue as planned.This latest action adds to growing efforts by the administration to tighten entry rules for foreign students, citing threats to national security and concerns around campus unrest. The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have not commented on the development yet.The sudden pause in visa processing follows previous signals from Rubio about a tougher approach.In March, he referred to students who he claimed were coming to the US not to study, but to engage in protests. Citing the case of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was arrested and later released on bail after writing an op-ed in support of Gazans, Rubio said: “If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason you are coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus—we’re not going to give you a visa. ”The visa freeze also comes on the heels of another controversy involving Harvard University. Just days ago, the DHS attempted to stop the prestigious school from enrolling international students, although that move was blocked by a federal judge. The administration has also threatened to pull back all federal contracts with Harvard, worth nearly $100 million—and US President Trump has warned of redirecting billions in grant money away from the university.Despite the crackdown, some voices within the academic community are advocating for a more balanced approach. Speaking on Fox Business, Kevin O’Leary, a lecturer at Harvard Business School, said: “These students are extraordinary individuals and they don’t hate America. Why don’t we vet them first, check their backgrounds, clear them, and tell them, ‘You graduate Harvard, you’re an engineer or whatever, you stay here and you start a business here and you’ll get funded here and you’ll create jobs here because that’s why you came here in the first place. ’”",US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued the order via a diplomatic cable on Tuesday.

Tommy Robinson gets early release because of ‘change in attitude’

British far-right activist Tommy Robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a UK judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Upon release, Robinson credited tech billionaire Elon Musk and the platform for enabling him to share his version of events. “I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative,"" he said during a livestream to his followers. ""These attempts at censorship, to silence, to cancel people, it hasn't worked. You've attempted to lock up the truth. And that truth has been echoed around the entire globe,"" he added.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon was jailed for violating a court order prohibiting him from repeating libelous claims about a Syrian refugee, Jamal Hijazi . He was sent to jail in October 2024 for contempt of court after admitting that he broke a legal order. The 42-year-old had accused Hijazi of being a violent bully—allegations a court deemed false.He later featured the claims in a documentary titled Silenced, which he shared on X (formerly Twitter), owned by Elon Musk. Musk has previously expressed support for Robinson, saying he was jailed “for telling the truth” and calling for his release.Justice Jeremy Johnson granted Robinson’s early release, citing a “change in attitude” though with ""absence of contrition or remorse.""""He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again, and that he is aware of the consequences of what would happen if he breached the injunction again,"" the judge said.Robinson admitted in October to breaching the injunction by promoting the Silenced film and discussing the case in media interviews and public rallies. His previous videos about Hijazi reportedly led to widespread harassment of the boy, who dropped out of school and relocated with his family. A 2021 libel case awarded Hijazi £100,000 in damages.A repeat offender, Robinson has previously served time for assault, mortgage fraud, and contempt of court. He remains a polarizing figure in Britain’s far-right circles and retains a sizable following both in the UK and abroad.His legal team has assured that he would comply with the original court order moving forward.",British far-right activist Tommy Robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a UK judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court.

PANAJI: Agriculture minister Ravi Naik on Monday urged Goans not to sell their ancestral land to builders and people from Delhi and Hyderabad. Naik said that the rampant sale of land to non-Goans will leave Goans landless and lead to a decline of agriculture.“Delhi is hot and has a lot of pollution. During those days, people want to come to Goa. They buy homes here, buy land here. Goans should not sell their land to Delhiites. Goans should not sell their land to anyone,” he said.“We should not sell our land, otherwise, Goa will not remain. There will be no land left for Goans. People can come here, have a picnic, and they must go back,” Naik told television reporters.Naik also appeared upset with tourists who travel in buses and jeeps to Goa but do not stay at hotels. “We need to preserve our ancestral land. We get some tourists in jeeps who cook and eat on the roadside, create a mess, and go. What does Goa get from them? Nothing. We don’t want such tourists who don’t stay in hotels,” said Naik.",Agriculture minister Ravi Naik urged Goans not to sell their ancestral land to builders and people from Delhi and Hyderabad.

BENGALURU: A youngster damaged glass containers at a bakery after being denied free cigarettes and tea in Krishnamurthy Layout, Suddaguntepalya, recently. When the bakery owner warned that he would report the incident to police, the youth allegedly responded with obscene language towards cops and challenged them to take action against him.Suddaguntepalya police have taken up a case against the accused and launched a manhunt. In his complaint, Ramsidh Saifullah, owner of SG Bakes and Juice, stated the incident took place last week. The accused, Appi, in his early 20s, visited the shop around 12.30pm and asked for a cigarette and tea. Saifullah told Appi he would give him the items only after receiving payment, as Appi often visited the shop, took cigarettes and other products, and left without paying.Appi got angry and started abusing Saifullah, even issuing dire threats. Appi then allegedly took the glass containers in which various items were stored and smashed them on the road.A senior officer said the shopkeeper didn't fire a complaint earlier as he was scared. A video clip of the incident, recorded on a mobile phone, went viral Monday, following which Saifullah approached the cops. ""We suspect that Appi was under the influence of alcohol or drugs,"" a police officer said.According to locals, Appi works as a painter and is often found spending time in graveyards and other public places. A team has been formed to nab him at the earliest.","A young man named Appi damaged glass containers at a bakery after being refused free cigarettes and tea.

Police investigations suggest improper maintenance led to the incident, prompting a case registration and further inquiry into the park's safety practices.

Cops: Ride was not maintained properly





CHENNAI: At least 30 people, including eight children and 10 women, were trapped 50ft above the ground for nearly three hours when a roller coaster malfunctioned on Monday evening at an amusement park at Injambakkam on East Coast Road (ECR).All were later rescued by fire and rescue services personnel. The incident occurred around 6pm when the “Topgun” roller coaster abruptly got stuck mid-air following a loud noise. The ride, which ascends vertically before descending at speed, stopped midcycle, leaving its occupants stranded and screaming in panic.Some of the people whose children were trapped in the roller coaster took to X to vent their anger against the park management, questioning why no staff were available to rescue those trapped.Initially, the park staff attempted to resolve the issue and tried using a crane available on site, but the equipment was unable to reach the required height. Later, the fire department was alerted, and a rescue team arrived from Guindy with a sky-lift vehicle capable of reaching up to 150ft.Rescue efforts began around 8.30pm and lasted for about an hour. Fire service personnel first distributed biscuits and water to those stuck on the ride before lowering each of them to safety.Medical teams stationed at the site provided first aid to the rescued individuals, none of whom suffered any serious injuries.Adyar deputy commissioner of police Pon Karthik Kumar supervised the rescue operation. Following the incident, the Neelankarai police registered a case and launched an investigation into the amusement park’s safety practices.“Preliminary findings suggest the ride was not properly maintained and had preexisting mechanical issues that were ignored by the operators,” said an investigation officer.","At least 30 people, including eight children and 10 women, were trapped 50ft above the ground for nearly three hours when a roller coaster malfunctioned.

Beyond Joe Biden and Donald Trump: How gerontocracy is weakening US democracy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/beyond-joe-biden-and-donald-trump-how-gerontocracy-is-weakening-us-democracy/articleshow/121453624.cms,"Beyond Biden and Trump: How gerontocracy is weakening US democracy

A lost generation of leadership

Age and power: A party problem

A warning from the past

The consequences of clinging to power





After bombshell news of former US President Joe Biden 's cancer diagnosis rocked the political landscape, a deeper crisis is confronting the Democratic Party: its longstanding reliance on ageing lawmakers and a rigid seniority system that critics say is choking fresh talent and weakening opposition to President Donald Trump's aggressive agenda.In just over a year, six Democratic members of Congress — all in their 70s or older — have died, leaving gaping holes in the party's ability to resist Republican policies. The most glaring example came last week when House Republicans passed Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill by a single vote. Democrats, missing three crucial members who recently died from cancer, could not marshal the numbers even to delay it.""Imagine if one of the older and sicker Dems had retired instead of dying in office and what that would've meant for millions of people,"" political strategist Rebecca Katz wrote on X.One of the most high-profile losses was Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, 75, who died just a day before the vote. Ironically, Democrats had recently elevated Connolly to lead the influential Oversight Committee, passing over younger, more dynamic figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 35.""By elevating someone who was more of a standard politician, they sort of lost out on getting into the culture,"" said political commentator Molly Jong-Fast.""That was a miss for Democrats.""The moment has crystallised a growing belief within the party: that its leadership culture is fundamentally out of step with the urgency of the times, and the generational shift among its voters.The Democratic Party isn't alone in housing ageing leadership — Senate Republicans only recently saw 83-year-old Mitch McConnell step down as minority leader. But for Democrats, the issue has had more damaging consequences. With the party in the congressional minority, every seat counts. Vacancies due to death or prolonged illness are not just sad footnotes — they're potential policy disasters.The average age of top Democratic committee leaders in the House is 69, compared to 62 for Republicans. Former speaker Nancy Pelosi, 85, remains a major force behind the scenes. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer is 74. And at the top of the ticket: Joe Biden, 82, now confirmed to be battling prostate cancer amid mounting concerns about his mental acuity.The age issue isn't confined to Congress. Liberals continue to rue the decision of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in office at 87, allowing Trump to fill her seat and shift the court dramatically to the right. She could have retired during the Obama years, but didn't.Despite these high-stakes lessons, efforts to inject youth into the Democratic leadership have been minimal. Gun control activist David Hogg, 25, was elected vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee this year and immediately called for primary challenges to ""out-of-touch, ineffective Democrats."" The backlash from party elders was swift and vicious. Veteran strategist James Carville, 80, dismissed Hogg as a ""contemptible little twerp. ""For younger Democrats, the situation is untenable. They argue that the stakes — climate change, reproductive rights, democratic integrity — demand vigorous, future-focused leadership. But the party's deeply entrenched culture of seniority and loyalty has created a bottleneck, sidelining younger voices at precisely the moment when the base is demanding generational change.""If you're saying democracy is on the ballot — and that this is the most important election of our lifetimes — then the base expects you to act like it,"" said Jong-Fast. ""They expect you to elevate the people who can speak better than the people who are your friends.""","Six Democratic members of Congress in their 70s or older have died in just over a year.

The body of longtime Las Vegas freelance writer Matthew Kelemen, 56, was discovered last week inside a container at a downtown business.Las Vegas police said they responded to a report of a “foul-smelling odor” on May 20, leading to the grim discovery. Kelemen's cause and manner of death were still under investigation, the coroner's office in Las Vegas said Tuesday.Kelemen's 63-year-old roommate was identified by police as the suspect in his death. However, the man died last week following a high-speed car chase involving the Utah Highway Patrol, reported AP.Police said the pursuit was unrelated to the investigation, but did not provide further details.Kelemen’s sister, Mikki Zaferatos said that her brother had described his roommate as “strange” and had been uncomfortable living with him.Kelemen was a well-known figure in Las Vegas’s media landscape, contributing film reviews, feature stories, and profiles to local outlets for nearly two decades.He wrote regularly for Las Vegas Weekly and served as a staff writer for the now-defunct magazines 944 and City Life after moving to the city in 2003. His final published piece, a story on Donny Osmond’s Strip residency, appeared just days ago in Las Vegas Magazine.","Matthew Kelemen, 56, was a longtime Las Vegas freelance writer.

California sports body widens entry for ‘biological female’ athletes amid trans athlete controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-sports-body-widens-entry-for-biological-female-athletes-amid-trans-athlete-controversy/articleshow/121452328.cms,"(Image credits: Facebook handle of California interscholastic federation)





The California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships following public backlash over the inclusion of a transgender athlete, reported AP.In a statement issued Tuesday, the CIF said it would implement a ""pilot entry process"" to extend entry to more “biological female” athletes. The new rule allows any athlete who missed the automatic qualifying mark but had the next-best result in their section final to compete at the state level.“The CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes,” the organisation said.The change only applies to this weekend’s competition. The CIF did not say how many athletes would be affected or whether the rule applies to all events or only those where a transgender athlete has qualified for the final. This could be the first time a high school sports governing body in the US has expanded competition in response to the participation of a transgender athlete.The change was introduced after US President Trump criticised the participation of trans athlete AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete competing in girls track and field.Trump threatened Tuesday to pull federal funding from California if the state did not bar transgender students from competing in girls’ sports.“THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Hernandez is set to compete in the girls varsity triple jump, high jump, and long jump at the state finals. She won the Division 3 girls long jump and triple jump and placed seventh in the high jump at the Southern Section Division Finals on May 19.Parents and conservative advocates opposed to transgender girls competing in girls sports have criticized Hernandez and heckled her during postseason meets.After losing to Hernandez in the long jump at the sectional final, La Canada High School’s Katie McGuinness called on the CIF to revise its policy.California governor Gavin Newsom recently said on his podcast that it is “deeply unfair” for transgender girls to participate in girls sports.Last month, Democratic state lawmakers in California blocked bills that would have barred transgender girls from participating in girls sports.","California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships.

In Japan, bobtail cats are considered good luck and Nagasaki is the place to find them.They are known as ""omagari neko (bent-tail cats)"" or ""kagi neko (hook cats)"" and have their own society of admirers and even a dedicated Shinto shrine.Their tails come in varieties including hook-shaped at the tip, curved or in a bun, explained Kazuya Hideshima, a worker at Omagari Neko Shrine and member of the Nagasaki Cat Society.Past findings have indicated bobtails accounted for nearly 80% of the cats in Nagasaki, twice the occurrence of anywhere else in Japan.Japanese cats are believed to have come from China in the 6th century with Buddhist monks, serving as rat hunters to protect religious scriptures on ships.Nagasaki bobtails have their roots in the Dutch East Indies when the city was the only foreign port during Japan's closed era in the 17th to 19th centuries. They hunted rats to protect shipments on their way from Southeast Asia to Japan, according to Nagasaki cultural officials.Soshin Yamamoto, a veterinarian and cat specialist, said the large population of bobtails in Nagasaki is likely the result of a genetic mutation that reproduced in a relatively isolated environment when the nation was shut up tight.""Having bobtails is no problem for most cats living a normal life, as long as they live near humans and aren't jumping and running around like wild cats in a forest,"" he said.Nagasaki residents hope the cats bring in tourists and help business.Natsuno Kani, a 50-year-old tourist from Tokyo who recently visited the bobtail shrine, said she knew Nagasaki was famous for bent-tail cats.But Abigail Tarraso, an artist from Spain based in Takeo City in neighboring Saga prefecture, was unfamiliar with the species, which is not as popular in Spain.""Today is the first time in Nagasaki that I have ever heard of this,"" said Cindy Bi, an American who is also an artist. ""I am excited to look around for them. Maybe we will see a few.""","Japanese cats are believed to have come from China in the 6th century with Buddhist monks.

Trump administration sues North Carolina election board over missing voter ID numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-sues-north-carolina-election-board-over-missing-voter-id-numbers/articleshow/121454121.cms,"US President Donald Trump has filed lawsuit against North Carolina's election board (Image credit: AP)





The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against North Carolina's election board for violating a federal law regarding voter registrations. As per the accusations, the board has failed to collect mandatory ID numbers from some voters during registration.The US Department of Justice says the State has failed to comply with the 2002 Help America Vote Act which requires voters to provide either a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number during registration. If a person doesn’t have either, the state must assign them a unique ID number.In late 2023, when Democrats controlled the state election board, they admitted there was some issue regarding missing ID numbers after a voter complained. Even though they updated the registration form, they didn't reach out to previous registered voters to collect the missing information before the general elections of North Carolina in 2024.Lawyers from the justice department's Civil Rights Division want a judge to give the state 30 days to contact voters with records that don't comply with federal law and update their records. The department says voter rolls must be accurate to ensure fair and legal elections.This isn’t the first time the issue has come up. Republicans had earlier filed similar lawsuits, saying around 225,000 voter registrations might be missing ID numbers.The leadership of North Carolina’s election board changed this month after a new law gave Republicans more control. The board now has a Republican majority, and its new executive director, Sam Hayes, says they’re reviewing the lawsuit and are committed to following federal law.Local elections in North Carolina are scheduled for September.","US President Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against North Carolina's election board for violating a federal law regarding voter registrations.

US President Donald Trump said that Canada could be included in his proposed ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system at ""zero cost"", if it agrees to become the ""cherished 51st state"" of the United States or pay $61 billion to take part in the project.""I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.""But (it) will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!"" he added.So far, Canada has not issued an official response to the proposal.Earlier this year, during a visit to Washington, then-defence minister Bill Blair said Canada was interested in joining the missile defense system, calling it “sensible” and in the country’s “national interest.”Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also confirmed that Canada had held ""high-level"" talks with the United States about joining proposed ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system.""We are conscious that we have an ability, if we so choose, to complete the Golden Dome with investments in partnership (with the US). And it's something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level,"" Carney said.The ""Golden Dome"" initiative announced by Trump just last week, is a sweeping $175 billion plan aimed at building an advanced air and missile defense shield across North America by the end of his term in 2029.The system depends heavily on Canada’s help, especially using Arctic land to set up radar and tracking stations needed to detect missiles from countries like Russia and China.""Would it be helpful? Probably, but it's not vital or existential,"" said US Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, downplaying Canada's role. But many defence experts and officials have argued otherwise.Retired US Air Force General Glen VanHerck emphasised that “what Canada really brings is terrain,” which significantly enhances North American early warning capabilities.“If we can position, or Canada positions, over-the-horizon radars further north in the Arctic, that dramatically increases the United States and Canada’s ability to see over the pole into Russia, into China and other places,” he added.Yet, Trump appeared to downplay Canada’s importance in the project during its unveiling.Despite ongoing talks and shared defense responsibilities through NORAD, Trump’s statehood remarks and aggressive posture risk straining US-Canada relations. North American neighbours Canada and the United States are partners in continental defense through the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).During a recent visit to the White House, PM Mark Carney firmly rejected Donald Trump’s statement that Canada should become the 51st US state, stating that his country is “never for sale.”Although some trade tensions have eased, the future of Trump’s proposed Golden Dome missile defense system remains uncertain without Canada’s full support.So far, no final agreement has been reached, but Trump continues to push the idea of closer ties, going as far as suggesting Canada join the US as a state.","US President Donald Trump said that Canada could be included in his proposed ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system at ""zero cost"" If it agrees to become the ""cherished 51st state"" of the United States or pay $61 billion to take part in the project, Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Students rally amid graduation week

Trump's escalating war on academia

Courts intervene — for now

Alumni, faculty join legal pushback





Hundreds of Harvard University students staged a mass protest Tuesday after the US President Donald Trump's administration announced it would cancel all remaining federal contracts with the university, an aggressive move estimated to cost the institution $100 million.The decision, part of President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on elite universities he accuses of fostering liberal bias and antisemitism, triggered immediate backlash on campus. Protesters rallied against what many see as an authoritarian overreach designed to punish academic independence and international inclusion.Gathering near Harvard Yard just days before graduation, students waved placards and chanted slogans like ""Trump = traitor"" and ""Who belongs in class today? Let them stay!"", a direct reference to Trump's revocation of Harvard's accreditation to the US student and exchange visitor program. The move puts thousands of international students and scholars in limbo, with many now facing deportation or forced transfers.""I'm graduating this week, and instead of celebrating, I'm here protesting,"" said senior Alice Goyer, donning her academic gown. ""My international classmates don't know if they'll even be allowed to stay.""The department of homeland security had previously revoked Harvard's authorisation to host foreign students, one of several punitive measures aimed at forcing the university to overhaul its curriculum, admissions process, and DEI programs.The financial cuts announced Tuesday are the latest in a series of attacks against Harvard by the Trump administration. Billions in federal grants have already been frozen, and multiple legal challenges are now underway to overturn the measures.On Monday, Trump doubled down, labelling foreign students at Harvard as ""radicalised lunatics"" and vowing to ""purge the system.""Legal experts say the administration's actions are unlikely to hold up in court. ""The case is so strong that the courts will not let this stand,"" said Ray Brescia, a law professor at Albany Law School.A judge has issued a temporary restraining order on the student and exchange visitor program revocation, with a full hearing scheduled for Thursday, coinciding with Harvard's commencement ceremony.The stakes are high for international students, who make up 27% of Harvard's student body. Many now fear they may be forced to leave the country just as they complete their degrees.British student Jack, who declined to give his full name, said the fallout could impact Harvard's global standing. ""The cloud may pass, but the damage is done. If I were applying for a PhD today, I wouldn't choose the US.""Alumni are also stepping in. On June 9, a group called Crimson Courage plans to file a class-action lawsuit against the administration. Faculty members say the standoff has already harmed Harvard’s academic reputation.""I've had colleagues abroad tell me they're now warning students against applying to US universities,"" said Professor Ryan Enos at the rally. ""It's heartbreaking.""California governor Gavin Newsom, who has clashed with Trump on education policy, called the attacks on Harvard ""a betrayal of American values.""",Harvard University students staged a mass protest after the US President Donald Trump's administration announced it would cancel all remaining federal contracts with the university. The decision triggered immediate backlash on campus. Protesters rallied against what many see as an authoritarian overreach designed to punish academic independence and international inclusion.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121452526,imgsize-1164771,width-400,resizemode-4/121452526.jpg"

Major pervert:

Atomic bomb of pedophilia:





A French court is to give its verdict Wednesday in the trial of a surgeon who admitted to sexually abusing hundreds of patients over more than two decades, in one of the country's largest child sex abuse cases.Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, is already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.In this trial, which began in February, he has admitted sexually assaulting or raping 299 patients -- 256 of them under 15 -- in hospitals in western France between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations.Le Scouarnec is charged with 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults and is set to emerge as one of the most prolific convicted sex predators in France's history.The victims have been represented by around 60 lawyers.""I hope the verdict will be commensurate with the horrors he committed,"" Amelie Leveque, one of the victims, told AFP.""But I don't believe it very much.""Victims and child rights advocates say the surgeon's case highlights systemic shortcomings that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.Prosecutor Stephane Kellenberger on Friday requested the maximum 20-year sentence for the retired surgeon and also made the rare demand that he should be held in a centre for treatment and supervision even after any release.""I am not asking the court for leniency,"" Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement in Vannes in the western region of Brittany on Monday.""Simply grant me the right to become a better person,"" he said.The verdict, which will be handed down by presiding judge Aude Buresi, is set to be announced from noon (1000 GMT).French law does not allow sentences to be added together even when there are multiple victims.One of the lawyers, Maxime Tessier, has asked the court to take into account the ""exceptional"" nature of Le Scouarnec's confession when he admitted all the charges against him in March.The retired surgeon also said he considered himself ""responsible"" for the death of two of his victims -- Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.Le Scouarnec documented his crimes, noting his victims' names, ages, addresses and the nature of the abuse.In his notes, the doctor described himself as a ""major pervert"" and a ""paedophile"".""And I am very happy about it,"" he recorded.While Le Scouarnec has asked his victims for forgiveness, many of them have questioned the sincerity of his apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial, sometimes word for word.""You are the worst mass pedophile who ever lived,"" said one of the lawyers representing the victims, Thomas Delaby, describing him as the ""atomic bomb of paedophilia"".The victims ""will never forgive you. Never,"" Delaby told the defendant.""Who are you trying to convince that you've changed?"" said another lawyer, Delphine Caro.""Admitting everything is admitting nothing,"" added a third lawyer, Giovanni Bertho-Briand.The surgeon practised for decades until his retirement in 2017 despite a 2005 sentence for owning sexually abusive images of children and colleagues raising their concerns.Le Scouarnec might stand trial again in the future, the public prosecutor said in his closing speech.The Lorient public prosecutor's office has opened two investigations linked to the retired doctor's case, one of which concerns ""possibly unidentified or newly reported victims"" of sexual assault and rape.There has been frustration among some that the trial has not had the impact in France they hoped for.The case has not won the attention given to the case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed last year for recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his now ex-wife Gisele.","Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, is already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children.

'We Want To Know Who...': Donald Trump Targets Harvard Over Foreign Students, Threatens $9B in Cuts

Trump-Putin ‘Secret’ Tango Troubles Zelensky; Despite Rap In Public, US ‘Accepts Russia…’





The Trump administration is directing federal agencies to cancel contracts worth approximately $100 million with Harvard University, a senior administration official confirmed Tuesday, escalating a growing standoff with the Ivy League institution.The move comes on top of more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants that have already been withdrawn from the university. The administration's latest action involves a draft letter from the General Services Administration (GSA), which instructs agencies to review existing agreements with Harvard and seek alternative vendors. A version of the letter was expected to be sent out Tuesday, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The New York Times first reported the existence of the letter.President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Harvard, branding it a “hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism,” amid ongoing tensions over the university's governance and policies. On April 21, Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the administration’s push for sweeping changes in its leadership structure, admissions processes, and governance.Since then, the administration has retaliated by slashing federal support, restricting international student enrollment, and threatening to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status.A second administration official said about 30 contracts spanning nine federal agencies are under review for cancellation. These include services such as executive training programs for Department of Homeland Security personnel. While some contracts deemed critical may not be terminated immediately, agencies are being asked to prepare transition plans to shift services away from Harvard.The new directive targets only federal contracts and does not affect the university’s remaining research grants.","The move comes on top of more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants that have already been withdrawn from the university.

Court decision follows legal application to purge contempt

Controversial figure remains divisive

Robinson thanks Elon Musk





British TV channels interrupted their regular broadcast on Tuesday morning after Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after repeatedly breaching a 2021 injunction. The injunction had been granted to prevent him from making false claims against a Syrian refugee, who later won a libel case against him.GB News presenter Eamonn Holmes told viewers: “Tommy Robinson has been released from jail, that is four months early. He was originally jailed for 18 months for contempt of court after multiple breaches of an injunction, that was four years ago, but reportedly showed a ""change in attitude.”“He was originally due to be released on July 26,"" he added.Robinson looked visibly changed in his first public appearance since his release, sporting a thick beard and appearing older. Social media quickly reacted to the images, with many saying he was “unrecognisable.”Robinson’s early release came after a legal request to purge his contempt of court charge.His lawyers told the high court he had demonstrated a “commitment” to complying with the injunction. This commitment included refraining from repeating defamatory statements about the Syrian teenager.Although progress had been made, Justice Johnson said Robinson still showed “no real remorse or contrition.” Even so, he noted there had been a “change in attitude” since sentencing, which helped justify cutting the sentence.Lawyers representing the Solicitor General did not oppose the move, saying Robinson had taken necessary steps to follow the terms of the court order.Robinson remains one of the UK’s most controversial political figures. He co-founded the far-right English Defence League in 2009 and has faced multiple legal issues since. His supporters have often claimed he is unfairly targeted by the establishment, while critics have long denounced his inflammatory rhetoric and criminal record.His release will likely reignite debate over freedom of speech, contempt of court, and the limits of public discourse. The very issues Robinson himself has often used as rallying cries.Following Robinson's release, the reaction online was swift and polarised. Supporters celebrated his release, while critics questioned the decision and the message it might send.Tommy Robinson thanked Elon Musk as he was released early. Robinson said, ""I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative."" Musk has shown support for Robinson, calling for his release and saying he was jailed ""for telling the truth.""Robinson is seen very differently by people. His supporters view him as a free speech martyr who tells the truth. However, his opponents call him a convicted fraudster who spreads lies and false information.","Tommy Robinson was released from prison four months early.

Annabelle Doll Missing: ‘They lost Annabelle?’ Internet meltdown over haunted doll - here’s what really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-lost-annabelle-internet-meltdown-over-haunted-doll-heres-what-really-happened/articleshow/121392274.cms,"Annabelle doll (Screengrab from FB video posted by Ryan D. Buell.)

The haunted doll that terrifies millions

From horror icon to internet meme





The infamous Annabelle doll, known as one of the most feared haunted objects in the world, became the center of an internet firestorm in the past few days after social media users claimed it had mysteriously vanished during a paranormal tour in the US. The doll, currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit, reportedly wasn’t visible to visitors at a recent stop, sparking fears, conspiracy theories, and viral panic online.The speculation intensified after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Resort in White Castle, Louisiana- just days after Annabelle had been displayed in the state. While officials confirmed that no injuries occurred and dismissed any supernatural link to the blaze, social media users quickly pointed to the doll’s presence as a chilling coincidence.“So the streets are saying after they moved the Annabelle doll out of the Warren museum (when they explicitly said never to move it) she's now gone missing.” one user posted on X (formerly Twitter), echoing the sentiments of thousands who feared the worst. Another exclaimed, “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL??? ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED POSSESSIONS?? THAT ANNABELLE?""Despite the viral meltdown, the panic was short-lived.Dan Rivera of the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which oversees the Warren Occult Museum’s collection, released a video showing the doll safe and sound in its protective glass case back in Connecticut.“Some wild and crazy internet rumours this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost,” read the caption alongside the video, posted by Ryan D. Buell.The Annabelle doll’s legend dates back to the 1970s, when it was reportedly given as a gift to a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut. What appeared to be a harmless Raggedy Ann doll soon exhibited disturbing behavior- moving on its own, leaving handwritten notes, and allegedly attacking one of the occupants.The case caught the attention of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who concluded that the doll wasn’t possessed by a child’s spirit, but manipulated by a demonic entity. The Warrens took the doll into their care and placed it inside a sealed glass case in their Occult Museum, where it has remained under lock and key- until recently.Though the museum in Monroe, Connecticut, remains closed to the public, Annabelle is currently on a national tour, part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit. The event showcases haunted artifacts from the Warrens' collection and has drawn massive interest across the country. In May, the doll made headlines after appearing at the former Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia- a notoriously haunted site. A video of the doll being moved into the penitentiary racked up over 9 million views on TikTok, reigniting public fascination with the paranormal.Annabelle’s legend exploded into the mainstream with the 2014 release of Annabelle, the horror film that spun off from The Conjuring franchise. The series has since grossed more than $800 million globally, turning the doll into a pop culture icon—and a consistent source of real-world fear.Following its West Virginia appearance, Annabelle’s tour has included stops in New Orleans and is scheduled to continue in San Antonio, Texas, and other cities, including locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.In the meantime, whether the doll ever left the museum or whether the sightings were part of a promotional stunt remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that Annabelle continues to captivate and terrify the public imagination.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","The Annabelle doll is currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run’ exhibit.

As law officers search Arkansas' rugged Ozark Mountains for a former police chief and convicted killer who escaped prison this weekend by impersonating a guard and walking out through a gate a guard opened for him, the sister of one of his victims is on edge.Grant Hardin, the former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape and became known as the ""Devil in the Ozarks.""Hardin escaped Sunday from the North Central Unit - a medium-security prison also known as the Calico Rock prison - by impersonating a corrections officer ""in dress and manner,"" according to a court document. A prison officer opened a secure gate, allowing him to leave the facility.Rand Champion, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Corrections, described the clothes as not a standard inmate or correctional uniform.""There's nothing inside the prison that looks like that, so that's one of the challenges we're going through to find out what that was and how he was able to get that or manufacture it,"" he said.Champion said that the decision to house Hardin in a medium-security facility weighed the ""needs of the different facilities and inmates"" and ""assessments"" of his crimes.Hardin's escape happened days after 10 men fled a New Orleans jail by going through a hole behind a toilet. Eight of those fugitives have since been captured.Escape into rough terrain Cheryl Tillman, whose brother James Appleton was killed by Hardin in 2017, said she and other relatives are alarmed by Hardin's escape since they were witnesses in his court proceedings.""We were there at his trial when all that went down, and he seen us there, he knows,"" she told The Associated Press on Tuesday.Authorities are using canines, drones and helicopters to search the rugged northern Arkansas terrain, Champion said.The search area has expanded as the hours have gone on, though Champion didn't discuss exact details of the search area.""Where this facility is located, the topography does provide challenges,"" he said. ""At the same time, it kind of limits where he is able to get.""""It's called Calico Rock for a reason, because it's very rocky,"" he added.Video surveillance shows Hardin escaped at approximately 2:55 p.m. on Sunday, Champion said. Officials announced his escape at approximately 5 p.m. that evening.Complicating the search effort is the heavy rain that's fallen in recent days in the area, he said.Hardin's escape into a rural part of the state isn't necessarily an advantage, according to Craig Caine, a retired inspector with the U.S. Marshals who has handled many cases involving escaped prisoners throughout his nearly 30-year career with federal law enforcement.""At some point in time, he's going to run out of provisions,"" said Caine.""In more rural areas, most people know one another,"" Caine said, making it more likely that someone will identify Hardin and turn him in. ""In that aspect, it could be detrimental to him.""A rattled community Izard County Sheriff Charley Melton and other local sheriffs urged residents to lock their homes and vehicles and call 911 if they notice anything suspicious.Bryan Sexton, who prosecuted Hardin for both murder and rape, said that his office has reached out to officers who investigated Hardin and families affected by Hardin's crimes, which were the focus of a 2023 documentary, ""Devil in the Ozarks.""""Making those contacts again with folks who have moved on with their lives for the better part of a decade now and to have to be the one who picks up the phone and reminds them of what has happened to them is something that weighs heavily on me,"" Sexton said.Gateway, the town of about 450 people where Hardin briefly was the police chief in 2016, is in the same large county as the headquarters of retail giant Walmart in Bentonville. But Gateway and the northeast part of the county is far more rural and remote than Bentonville. The landscape only gets more rugged to the east, into the heart of the Ozarks and the Buffalo National River, toward Izard County where the escape happened.Darla Nix, a local cafe owner in nearby Pea Ridge, Arkansas, said her sons grew up around Hardin and knew him as a mostly quiet person before he was convicted.""He was always just one of the kids, a member of the community,"" Nix said.Describing Hardin as a ""very, very smart man,"" Nix said she anticipates that the search for Hardin will be challenging for law enforcement.""He knows where the caves are. He's just a survivor. He knows how to make it. They're going to have their hands full trying to catch him,"" Nix said.Tillman said she wasn't surprised when she heard that Hardin had escaped. But the news suddenly added fresh pain for her and other family members after dealing with the grief from the killing.""He's just an evil man,"" she said. ""He is no good for society.""Hardin pleaded guilty in October 2017 to first-degree murder for fatally shooting Appleton, 59. Appleton worked for the Gateway water department when he was shot in the head on Feb. 23, 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton's body inside a car.Investigators at the time did not release a motive for the killing and Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is also serving 50 years in prison for the 1997 rape of an elementary school teacher in Rogers, north of Fayetteville.Hardin had been held in the Calico Rock prison since 2017. The facility has a capacity of about 800 inmates, according to the Arkansas Department of Corrections.","Grant Hardin was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape.

Did Barron Trump apply to Harvard and get rejected? That's the question swirling across social media amid political tensions between the US President Donald Trump's administration and elite universities.However, First Lady Melania Trump refuted speculation that her son, Barron Trump, had applied to Harvard University, calling the rumours ""completely false"" in a statement to The Palm Beach Post on Tuesday.""Barron did not apply to Harvard, and any assertion that he, or that anyone on his behalf, applied is completely false,"" Melania said, addressing the social media chatter that claimed the 18-year-old had been denied admission to the Ivy League institution.Since Trump returned to office in January, his administration has taken an aggressive stance against Ivy League universities, including Harvard and Columbia, accusing them of tolerating antisemitism during pro-Palestinian student protests.As part of its crackdown, the White House initially withheld $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, conditioning the release of the funds on changes to campus policies.Separately, the department of homeland security cancelled nearly $3 million in grants to Harvard after the university declined to meet a list of demands, including eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, revising disciplinary policies, and banning face masks during campus demonstrations.These developments have fueled speculation about personal motives behind federal decisions and led to false reports surrounding Barron Trump's academic future.Barron recently completed his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business. He enrolled in September 2024, months before his father's re-election victory.In a December interview with Fox and Friends, Melania Trump opened up about Barron's college life, acknowledging that the experience has been shaped by his unique status.""I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student. His experience at college is very different than any other kid,"" she said, adding, ""He's very strong, and he knows that he's in a different position than other children.""","First Lady Melania Trump calls rumours that her son Barron applied to Harvard ""completely false"" The 18-year-old recently completed his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business.

Families allege ‘fake encounter’ after three missing men found dead in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/families-allege-fake-encounter-after-three-missing-men-found-dead-in-balochistan/articleshow/121437104.cms,"



A fresh wave of suspected fake encounters in Balochistan has led to public anger, as rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday claimed it had killed three militants in an operation in the Tang Kiryar area of Barkhan district. The bodies of Abdul Rehman Buzdar, Fareed Buzdar, and Sultan Marri were later shifted to the Basic Health Unit hospital in Rakni.However, the families of the deceased and Baloch rights groups strongly disputed the official account. They said all three had been missing for months, victims of enforced disappearance, and insisted the encounter was fake.The activists alleged that ""the men were executed after being kept in illegal detention.”A CTD spokesperson said that the men died during an exchange of fire and that weapons were recovered from the scene. But this version of events has been widely rejected.In a separate incident, another youth, Ghaus Bakhsh, was found dead in Awaran district’s Kolwah tehsil. He had reportedly been summoned to a nearby military camp, and his body was discovered just hours later, bearing visible signs of torture.This added to growing suspicions of custodial killings.The Balochistan Post reported both incidents, saying the deaths follow a pattern seen in other districts such as Dukki, Ziarat and Quetta. In those cases too, individuals who had previously gone missing later turned up dead in what were officially described as security operations.Human rights groups and Baloch activists say these cases point to a disturbing trend of state-led violence. They are calling for independent investigations and international attention to ensure accountability. “This is part of a systematic campaign,” said one rights campaigner. “There needs to be an end to the impunity,"" they added.",Rights activists accuse security forces of killing people in custody and staging the events to look like clashes.
