SC to decide validity of Madras HC stay on Tamil Nadu law on University VC appointments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-decide-validity-of-madras-hc-stay-on-tamil-nadu-law-on-university-vc-appointments/articleshow/122260745.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday entertained Tamil Nadu’s petition questioning reasonableness of Madras HC’s order staying its legislation, which gave the state government, instead of the governor, the power to appoint University vice-chancellors, but refused M K Stalin government’s plea for suspending the HC order to re-operationalize the law.TN fielded a team of senior advocates – A M Singhvi, Rakesh Dwivedi and P Wilson – to argue that the HC had without considering the urgency to appoint vice-chancellors to universities, recommendations to which effect has been put in cold-storage by the Governor, stayed the legislation.The law giving state govt the power to appoint VCs to universities was stayed along with nine other laws, Bills for which were reserved for the President’s consideration by the governor but were regarded as deemed to have been approved by President in a controversial unprecedented ruling by a two-judge SC bench on Apr 8.Three days after the ‘deemed to have been approved’ ruling by the SC, which now is subject to a Constitution bench’s opinion on a Presidential Reference questioning the use of Article 142 power of the SC to virtually obliterate roles assigned by the Constitution to President and Governors on Bills passed by Assemblies, the TN govt had notified the nine bills as laws.The bench refused to stay the HC order but asked the UGC and the public interest litigation petitioner before the HC to respond to TN’s petition in four weeks.For UGC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the law is palpably contrary to the UGC Regulations which empower only governors to appoint VCs to the universities.When the senior advocates pleaded that they would argue before the HC for vacation of the stay, Mehta said that in that case the TN must withdraw its petition seeking transfer of the PIL from Madras HC to the SC. “The state cannot have both options open at the same time and be permitted to argue before the HC that the SC is considering transfer of the PIL to itself,” he said.Wilson sought expunging of certain ‘harsh remarks’ against him by the HC merely because he was pointing out the SC’s 2-J bench order. Justices Narasimha and Mahadevan said this request would be considered by the SC during the final hearing on the TN’s petition.One of the Acts, notified on Apr 11 by the state related to vesting in the state govt the powers of the Governor, as Chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors of universities in the state. A vacation bench of the HC on May 21 granted stay on this amending provision, holding that UGC Regulations, 2018, would prevail over the state legislation by virtue of doctrine of repugnancy.The state said it had raised the objection to the delay in filing of the PIL but the division bench of the HC “did not even call for an explanation from the Registry of the HC or the Petitioner but proceeded to hear the case in a tearing hurry.” The HC “showed undue haste”, did not even give a week’s time to the state to file its counter affidavit, and passed the stay order “for extraneous reasons”, it said, adding that the impugned order is replete with personal attacks on the senior counsel who appeared for the state.","The Supreme Court on Friday entertained Tamil Nadu’s petition questioning reasonableness of Madras HC's order staying its legislation.

'Do Aamir Khan, Javed Akhtar Speak in Marathi?' Maha Minister's Reaction on Language Row Goes Viral

Poll Will the unity of Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS influence the upcoming local body elections? Yes, definitely. No, it won't matter.

NEW DELHI: For the first time in 20 years, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray will share the stage on Saturday. The two leaders will address a joint ""victory"" rally organised by their parties to mark the withdrawal of government resolutions (GRs) related to the three-language policy.The rally is being held at the NSCI Dome in central Mumbai's Worli, which falls in the assembly constituency of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray. The gathering is also seen as significant ahead of the upcoming local body elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.Uddhav and Raj Thackeray, whose parties have been vocal on the issues of Marathi language and identity, last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign. That was after former chief minister Narayan Rane had left the undivided Shiv Sena. Raj Thackeray quit the party later that year and launched the MNS in 2006.The rally comes in the backdrop of protests against the April 16 GR issued by the BJP-led Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, which made Hindi a compulsory third language for students from Classes 1 to 5 in English and Marathi medium schools. Following backlash, the government amended the GR on June 17, making Hindi optional.On June 29, the cabinet decided to withdraw both GRs entirely.On the same day, leaders from Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS had burnt copies of the GRs and had planned a protest march for July 5. After the rollback, both parties decided to hold a joint ""victory"" event instead. Uddhav and Raj had then said the government blinked after witnessing the unity of Maharashtrians and did not want them to come together.Though the two parties have chosen not to display any party flags, symbols, hoardings or scarves during the event, the political significance of the rally is being seen in the backdrop of their recent electoral performance. In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (UBT) won 20 seats while the MNS failed to win any.The parties have invited other political groups that opposed the GRs, as well as members of the literary and art community, to take part in the rally.The Congress, a partner in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Shiv Sena (UBT), has however said it will not attend the event. State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal said the party supports the stand against making Hindi mandatory but will not join the rally.NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) president Sharad Pawar also said in Pune on Thursday that he would not be attending due to prior commitments. However, NCP (SP) state president Jayant Patil said the party would be represented either by working president Supriya Sule or MLA Jitendra Awhad. Patil said MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar had personally invited the NCP (SP).The rally takes place amid recent incidents involving both parties. MNS activists were seen on camera assaulting a food stall owner for not speaking Marathi. In another case, two people were made to apologise to a man in front of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Rajan Vichare for allegedly attacking him. “Speak in Marathi since you have hit a Marathi person,” a voice is heard telling one of the two men while he tries to say something to Vichare, a former MP from Thane.","Uddhav and Raj Thackeray last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign.

PUNE: A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.""He also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,"" deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI on Thursday. ""We have seen the cropped selfie image and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting the gadget from her,"" he said.The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar and has been staying with her younger brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI. The society is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into ‘A', ‘B' and ‘C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents.The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone in the flat when the ""delivery agent"" came calling, police said.DCP Shinde said: ""The woman said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying, and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment to step in and bolted the door from inside before using the spray on her face. ""He said: ""The woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams from the Kondhwa police and the city crime branch have been deployed to work on leads to arrest the culprit. ""Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said.""We have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,"" said an officer, who is part of the probe. The police have registered a case relating to offences punishable under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI: ""We have collected the survivor's oral and nasal swab to establish the chemical substance alleged to have been used to render the survivor unconscious. We are certain about detecting the case soon and have roped in all our resources considering the nature and gravity of the crime.""Also read: Pune rape case: 'Delivery agent' who assaulted techie in flat arrested after 2 days; police investigating Preliminary investigation revealed that the intruder did not make an entry in the visitors' register maintained by the society.

The guards on duty have so far maintained that there was no entry or exit of any person around the time of the incident nor any outsider has been spotted in CCTV covering the passage leading to the ‘A' wing where the survivor stays.A society office bearer told TOI at the site: ""The brother-sister duo share a cordial relationship with all our members and have been paying their rent on time to the flat owner, who lives in Mumbai. The society is covered by two CCTV cameras. The 'A' wing, where the incident occurred, has CCTV cameras covering the passage, parts of the other wings and the parking area.""He said: ""We have installed a mobile application, a visitor management facility, to regulate entry on the society premises. Each member and tenant of the society has this application on their mobiles. We studied all the entries and exits on the application and realised that no delivery persons — like food delivery, quick commerce or e-commerce — entered the society when the incident occurred. We have provided all details of the cellphone application and CCTV footage to the police. ""The office-bearer added: ""Only one thing could have happened. A delivery person, who has four or five deliveries to make in different flats, could have entered the society and then might have gone to the woman's flat. It does not require a separate entry on the mobile application when it comes to multiple deliveries.""","A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.

However, police said they were yet to ascertain the motive and would interrogate him after he arrived in Delhi late on Thursday.The victims were identified as Ruchika Sewani (42) and her son Krish (14).

In a new twist to the Pune rape case involving a 22-year-old IT professional, police now say the alleged attacker was not a stranger but someone known to the woman. According to investigators, the selfie used as evidence was taken by the woman herself and later edited, while the threatening message found on her phone was also typed by her, news agency PTI reported.“They know each other for a couple of years and belong to the same community.

On one side, there is China and on the other, Pakistan. Today, Nepal is also distancing itself from us. Everybody is moving away from us.”The Congress chief said that despite visiting 42 countries, PM Modi has not visited Manipur, where ethnic violence has led to loss of life. “He has travelled to 42 countries in the world, but so far he has not visited Manipur, where people are dying,” Kharge said.He accused PM Modi of neglecting domestic issues in favour of international appearances. “Modi ji, where are you? He is visiting eight countries, but he’s not looking towards his country's people. He is not looking at the farmers of this country,” he added.Kharge also alleged that the government under PM Modi has harmed the Indian economy over the last 11 years and undermined the Constitution.“He has ruined the country’s economy and destroyed the Constitution,” he said.He further mocked the prime minister, saying, “If someone gives Modi a cap or a medal he will wear it and go around,” urging that the focus should instead be on the welfare of farmers and the common people.Additionally, in a sharp attack on the RSS and BJP, Kharge referred to recent comments attributed to an RSS functionary suggesting the removal of the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ from the Constitution.“I challenge them – be it him, their BJP, PM Modi or Amit Shah – no one can remove those words,” Kharge said.During his address in Hindi, he said: “I heard that an RSS leader from Shimoga said that the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ should be removed from the Constitution. I challenge all of them – BJP, PM Modi, Amit Shah – no one can do it.”Reading from the BJP’s own organisational constitution, Kharge pointed out that the party’s own document states allegiance to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy.“If you hate secularism and socialism so much, why have you written it in your party’s Constitution?” he asked. “Your own party constitution says the BJP shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy. Then why are you trying to remove these values now?”Kharge also cited past Indo-Pak conflicts while criticising the current government's posture.He said: “You talk big about Pakistan. We helped them in the past. Then why did you back away? You say you ended the war between India and Pakistan. You say you calmed things down. Then why are you silent now, Prime Minister? Speak up. There is no need for Trump in India. We are strong, and we are ready to fight – just as Indira Gandhi once split Pakistan and created Bangladesh.”He urged PM Modi to stop misleading the people and to act decisively if the country’s interests are at stake.“If you had to act, you were in power, you could have. Don’t mislead the country. Don’t confuse the people,” he said.",Mallikarjun Kharge says India's foreign policy is flawed and has led to deteriorating ties with neighbouring countries.

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Popstar Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. Judi James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning— Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

“It’s gotten worse”: Teen girls say Hockey Canada trial proves #MeToo failed to protect their generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/its-gotten-worse-teen-girls-say-hockey-canada-trial-proves-metoo-failed-to-protect-their-generation/articleshow/122259590.cms,"Kitchener high school students express concerns about safety following the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial(Getty Images)

From the classroom to the workplace, consent remains misunderstood

Social media and toxic masculinity fuel the pressure

In the aftermath of the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial, a group of high school seniors from Kitchener, Ontario, are voicing what many women across the country are feeling — that despite the global attention from the #MeToo movement, little has changed when it comes to real-world safety, respect, and justice for young women.The girls, all 12th-graders, shared their daily experiences with harassment — not in viral headlines, but in grocery stores and bakeries, where older men make predatory remarks and ignore boundaries.Seventeen-year-old Samira Nur explained: “I encounter a lot of creepy men… I’m at work, and under the expectation that I still have to treat these people with kindness, despite the fact that I’m being, like, fully disrespected.”Her classmate, Anna De Sousa, recounted a chilling annual encounter with an older male customer: “Last year, he was like, ‘You’re 17 now. Next year, I’ll be back. We’re gonna go out.’ Every time I see his face, my body literally starts shaking.”These aren’t isolated incidents—they’re part of a wider issue that the girls say their education barely prepared them for. Consent was glossed over in brief lessons, often through awkward metaphors like “the tea video.”As Samira put it: “It wasn’t really treated very seriously.”The rise of online platforms has only made things worse. With Snapchat and Instagram, harassment is more anonymous, more constant, and more cruel. “Honestly, I think it’s gotten worse,” said Nishtha Tomer. “They will not say a word to you in real life, but online, it’s the meanest things.”And with influencers like Andrew Tate spreading misogynistic messages, girls like Loyd Gebreselassie are noticing a shift in male attitudes: “This trend is growing with younger men… All these ideologies they’ve gathered and almost try to force onto women.”The teens acknowledge #MeToo helped break silence and remove shame. But legal and systemic progress feels distant. “More so that than actually really solving anything,” said Shantelle Carrion.Also Read: When will the Hockey Canada sexual assault verdict be delivered?

A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements on Friday.Police footage shared by various media outlets showed the lion leaping over a barrier from its enclosure and chasing a woman carrying shopping bags on Thursday night. Surveillance video captured the lion pouncing on her back and knocking her to the ground, while a child attempted to flee. The lion was then seen chasing other pedestrians as bystanders scrambled to escape.According to a police statement citing the children's father, quoted by AFP, the lion attacked his kids aged five and seven years, after injuring the mother, causing injuries to their arms and faces.The victims received hospital treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The father's statement in the police report indicated that the lion's owners appeared entertained by the attack on pedestrians.Three individuals were arrested in connection to the case by police on Friday.

Breeders must pay substantial registration fees, and farms must occupy at least 10 acres of land.","A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements on Friday.

'Mistress chasing the wife...like a bad novel'







An Indian-origin woman, Sharanjit Kaur, has been sentenced to four years in jail after she pleaded guilty to reckless driving causing death of Jonathan Baker. The road rage took place on June 27 last year and the sentence was handed down by Hamilton District Court, New Zealand.According to reports, Kaur was triggered after she saw a photograph of her ex, referred to Mr R in court documents, with his wife and family at an Indian restaurant. It is not clear whether the man was her ex or current partner. Kaur confronted the man and then started following the wife, referred to as Mrs R.Court documents revealed that Kaur followed Mrs R at high speed, tailgating, brake-checking, and attempting to intimidate her. She drove recklessly on the wrong side of Boyd Road at speeds between 125–136 km/h before smashing into Baker’s vehicle. He died instantly and Kaur sustained minor injuries.49-year-old Baker's widow Andrea told the court how devastated she was when she received the news of her husband's death. She said her Christian faith prompted her to forgive Kaur. “In forgiveness for me comes freedom in the long run... I do forgive you, my hope is with you hearing these words...learn from it and do some good.”Baker’s mother-in-law Colleen told the court that Kaur killed a totally innocent man. “The mistress chasing the wife... is beyond comprehension, it’s like a bad novel”.She said a drunk or drugged driver-or even an angry wife chasing a mistress - would have made some sense.Kaur’s lawyer Anjeet Singh said she knew nothing she could say would alleviate the Bakers’ pain, but her client “accepts full responsibility”. She said the photo “led to a psychological collapse... Something more than rage”. The photo brought forth years of turmoil and uncertainty around her eight-year relationship, she said pleading for home detention, which was rejected.","'Mistress chasing the wife...like a bad novel' says victim's mother-in-law.

Ace footballers like Adam Johnson, Benjamin Mendy, and Cristiano Ronaldo have been charged with sexual assault in the past. Johnson sexually touched a 15-year-old fan who only wanted his autograph. Benjamin was asked if he called women to his house only to get them drunk, and have s*x. Cristiano Ronaldo was accused by a woman who alleged that he took her to his hotel suite in Las Vegas and sexually assaulted her. What happened before and after the charge? Let’s read on.In February 2016, Josh Halliday of The Guardian reported that former right winger for the Sunderland AFC, Adam Johnson, sexually touched a 15-year-old fan who idolised him after he gave her a signed football shirt. Prosecutor Kate Blackwell shared, “He was used to getting what he wanted. He gave her the shirts and autographs with the knowledge that she would want to please him in return. He knew her age. He knew she looked up to him; he knew he could take advantage of her, and he did. ” Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one count of grooming. He was jailed for six years. But on March 22, 2019, he was released after serving half of his jail term.In July 2023, BBC News reported that former Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy was cleared of r*ping a woman and attempting to rape another. One woman accused him of r*ping her in his mansion, while another came forward and said that she too was molested by him in his mansion. Mr. Benjamin Aina KC, the prosecutor in the case, asked Mendy, “You wanted women who came to your house to party, get drunk, and have s*x?” Mr. Mendy replied, “If they want. I will never force to have s*x with a woman.” He was found not guilty of r*pe charges. Manchester City released him in 2023. Currently, he is playing for FC Zurich of the Swiss Super League as a left-back.In October 2023, ESPN reported that Kathryn Mayorga was 25 when she met Cristiano Ronaldo at a nightclub in 2009. She went with him and other people to his Las Vegas hotel suite. She alleged that Ronaldo sexually assaulted her in a bedroom. She filed a lawsuit ten years after the incident. Ronaldo, through his lawyers, maintained that the s*x was consensual. In 2010, both of them reached a confidentiality agreement wherein Mayorga received $375,000 - Leslie Mark Stovall, her lawyer, acknowledged it. The case was dismissed in 2022 by U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey in Las Vegas. Dorsey imposed a fine of $335,000 on Mayorga’s lead lawyer, Stovall, for acting in “bad faith.”",Cristiano Ronaldo was accused by a woman who alleged that he took her to his hotel suite in Las Vegas and sexually assaulted her.

(Getty Images)

Dominik Hašek didn’t hold back: “Trump is doing everything he can to help Putin”



“The weakest president! @realDonaldTrump chatted with the biggest criminal of the 21st century, Putin, and he immediately sent more than 500 drones and ballistic missiles to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev… Trump is doing everything he can to help Putin in his imperialist goals… Despicable.”

This isn’t Hašek’s first rodeo when it comes to Putin and politics



He says Trump’s call emboldened Putin and now kids are suffering



“Trump has proven more than once that he is indifferent to the Ukrainian people,”

“Despicable.”

Things got darker: Russian officials reportedly threatened Hašek for speaking up



You don’t usually expect brutal political takedowns to come from NHL legends, but Dominik Hašek just changed the game. The Hall of Fame goalie, once known for stopping slapshots, is now stopping short of calling Trump a war enabler. After Donald Trump reportedly chatted with Vladimir Putin , Russia launched over 500 drones and missiles into Ukraine’s capital, injuring dozens. Hašek’s response? A firestorm tweet calling Trump “the weakest president” and accusing him of helping Putin’s “imperialist goals.” Yeah. This wasn’t just shade, it was a direct hit.The timing was too perfect and too horrifying. Just hours after Trump’s phone call with Putin, Russian forces unleashed a terrifying assault on Kyiv. Buildings exploded. Children were hurt. Civilians ran for cover. And Dominik Hašek didn’t stay quiet.Hašek has been one of the most vocal global athletes speaking out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since 2022.He’s labeled the war “imperialist,” demanded bans for Russian athletes who stay silent, and directly criticized international sports organizations for giving Putin a platform.He even called out the NHL for “cowardice” over its continued inclusion of Russian players, saying silence equals support.The latest drone strike wasn’t just any attack, it was one of the largest assaults on Kyiv in months. According to Ukrainian authorities, 539 drones and 11 ballistic missiles were launched, causing massive destruction and multiple injuries, including children.For Hašek, that kind of horror isn’t accidental, it’s the consequence of weak leadership.Hašek wrote.Earlier this year, Hašek revealed that Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president had allegedly sent him death threats in response to his activism. In one chilling message, Medvedev reportedly hinted that Hašek should take his own life. The Czech government took it seriously. Prime Minister Petr Fiala publicly backed Hašek, condemning the threats and offering him protection. But instead of backing down, Hašek went louder, filing formal complaints and urging the IOC and NHL to stop giving Russia a global stage.This isn’t just a former athlete popping off on social media. Hašek is leading a charge demanding accountability from sports leagues, politicians, and fans. He’s not trying to win popularity points. He’s calling Trump “despicable.” He’s calling Putin “the biggest criminal of the 21st century.” And he’s pushing the sports world to wake up and pick a side.Also read - Carolina Hurricanes fans react to Brent Burns’ retirement with emotional tributes","NHL legend Dominik Hašek has been one of the most vocal global athletes speaking out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since 2022.

Postcards from a storyteller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/postcards-from-a-storyteller/articleshow/122260941.cms,"



By: Sivadas VarmaBeneath the shade of the mangosteen tree, the plaintive melody of Soja Rajakumari… drifted from Vaikom Muhammad Basheer’s weathered gramophone. Between songs, his voice would fill the air, peppered with laughter as he took playful jabs at relatives, friends and the quiet absurdities of everyday life.“Our friendly chats, often flavoured with Fabi’s sulaimani and Saigal’s soulful songs, lasted for,” recalls KP Achuthan, who shared an intimate friendship with the legendary storyteller.Their bond began in the late 1940s when Achuthan was a student at Ernakulam Law College. Introduced by Ponjikkara Raffi, they often met at Circle Book House near Boat Jetty—later bought and renamed by Basheer as Basheer Book House. “I would skip classes to join the intellectual gatherings there, sharing moments with Ramu Kariat, Vayalar Rama Varma, and actor Sathyan,” says Achuthan.'“Somehow, Beypore Sultan became a part of my life and influenced me in all walks of life,” adds Achuthan, retired joint director of the Coir Board. Basheer was always keen to maintain the warmth of their relationship through frequent letters. Almost all of Basheer’s letters contained characters or indications of his future projects.Knowing Achuthan’s reading habits, he sent all his books with custom-written cover letters.On June 15, 1967, one such postcard arrived with Basheer’s controversial A Bhagavad Geeta and a Few Breasts. He advised Achuthan to give the Geeta to his sweetheart and keep the second part himself—a request made on postcard that Achuthan still preserves.His comments were often cheeky. When sending Premalekhanam, he urged Achuthan to revisit old romantic memories.After Achuthan’s marriage, replies were dictated to his wife, Shyamala Kumari, due to his poor handwriting. Recognizing this, Basheer began addressing her in his letters. He often referred to his own wife as Queen Fabi, daughter Shahina as princess and son Anees as prince—alongside news about his beloved pets.He affectionately called Achuthan Periya Nair and his wife Omana Kunjamma. The humour and warmth in these letters revealed the simplicity and heart of a man who found stories in everything around him.“Sultan picked his characters from life itself,” says Achuthan. “This endless list includes his intimate friends and his pet animals who could communicate with their master through the language of love,” Achuthan says.","KP Achuthan shared an intimate friendship with the legendary storyteller.

GURGAON: Two videos of unidentified persons performing stunts on city roads on two tractors near Cyber Hub have been making rounds on social media for the past two days, leaving even the police puzzled.The tractor occupants can be seen speeding near the Golf Course road without any check by the police. Surprisingly, the videos show minimal traffic on a road that typically experiences heavy congestion.Moreover, the tractors were seen without the number plates, with ‘Shera’ and ‘Sniper’ mentioned on the number plates.While both videos have gone viral, showing tractors equipped with heavy speakers playing loud music, police are now suspecting that the videos are AI-generated.ASI Sandeep, a police spokesperson, stated, “We found the videos on the internet and have started our investigation, but these are seemingly AI-generated videos.”An ACP rank officer added that authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area before taking appropriate legal action.Several people have been charged with acts like rash driving, performing stunts on busy roads, and endangering lives in the past.On July 16, DLF 1 police registered a case against unidentified persons after a video of a Lamborghini performing stunts on Golf Course Road went viral. An FIR was lodged under BNS Sections 125 (endangering life), 281 (rash driving), and 57 (abetment of offences by the public or by more than ten persons).Authorities included Section 57 because multiple vehicles were seen trailing the Lamborghini while recording the stunt, suggesting coordinated participation. Police have yet to arrest the Lamborghini driver or identify the owner as the vehicle lacked a number plate.Earlier, on June 8, police arrested four students following a social media video that captured reckless driving and dangerous stunts on the Dwarka Expressway near Bajghera police station.","Two videos of unidentified persons performing stunts on city roads on two tractors near Cyber Hub have been making rounds on social media for the past two days.

Two people were arrested in Australia in connection with a “Chinese blessing scam” that defrauded a 77-year-old woman in Sydney out of cash and jewellery worth 130,000 Australian dollars (about $85,000 USD).These arrests come amid a broader investigation into a wave of similar scams, which have been reported globally for the past 25 years in countries including the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand.A 63-year-old woman was arrested at Sydney International Airport on Thursday following an in-depth investigation by Strike Force Sentinel, a special unit formed in April to investigate the scam.The following day, her alleged accomplice, also 63, was taken into custody at Brisbane Airport as he attempted to board a flight to China. Authorities say he is likely to face charges soon.These scams commonly target elderly Asian women. Victims are typically led to someone posing as a spiritual healer, who instructs them to place their money and valuables into a bag. They are then told not to open the bag for several weeks or even months. When they finally do, they find the contents missing.“It’s a robbery by stealth. These offenders swarm these vulnerable victims, usually Asian, older females.They swarm like a pack of hyenas,” reported CNN quoting New South Wales police detective superintendent Guy Magee.Strike force sentinel has received around 80 reports involving the alleged theft of 3 million Australian dollars ($2 million USD). Police believe about 50 people are involved in the scam network, with 25 identified by name and 11 arrest warrants issued so far. Surveillance footage has also captured 25 other suspects taking part.Magee noted that the crime is likely “profoundly underreported,” with many victims feeling embarrassed or ashamed. He believes the real number of cases could be double the current estimates.A similar case occurred in New Zealand last year, where three Chinese nationals were arrested while trying to leave the country. Police said they arrived in October and, within days, targeted elderly victims, stealing around 30,000 New Zealand dollars ($18,000 USD) in cash and jewellery.NSW Police are urging community members to be cautious of strangers asking for directions to herbal doctors or spiritual healers, and advised people not to bring strangers home, not to hand over valuables, and never to participate in any ritual involving the “blessing” of money or jewellery.","A 77-year-old woman in Sydney was defrauded out of 130,000 Australian dollars (about $85,000 USD) Two people have been arrested in connection with the scam.

US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump met with the last living American hostage held in Gaza on Thursday at the White House.

Hamas said on Friday it has given a “positive” response to the latest proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza but called for further talks to implement an agreement, if reached.""Hamas has submitted its positive response to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators. We are fully prepared to immediately enter into a round of negotiations regarding the mechanism for implementing this framework,” its statement read, according to The Associated Press.However, the statement did not elaborate on what needed to be worked out in implementation.Also, it was not clear if the statement meant it had accepted the proposal from US President Donald Trump for a 60-day ceasefire.“We'll see what happens. We're going to know over the next 24 hours,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One late Thursday when asked if Hamas had agreed to the latest framework for a ceasefire.The Palestinian militant group, which controls Gaza, has been seeking guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war, which began with its attacks inside Israel on October 7, 2023, and the latter's subsequent military retaliation.Trump has been pushing hard for a deal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit the White House next week to discuss a deal.According to an official close to the talks, the group has put forth certain demands — that Israeli troops in Gaza pull back to positions held on March 2, before it broke the previous ceasefire (agreed and implemented in January); that aid flow into Gaza in sufficient quantities through the United Nations and other international humanitarian agencies; and that negotiations continue beyond 60 days if needed to reach a deal for a permanent end to the war and the release of all remaining hostages.Out of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas during the October 2023 attack, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.Previous rounds of negotiations have run aground over Hamas demands of guarantees that further negotiations would lead to the war's end, while Netanyahu has insisted Israel would resume fighting to ensure the destruction of the militant group.","Hamas has submitted its positive response to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators.

US President Donald Trump has shared a video where he, for the first time, acknowledged his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. The video, posted on July 4 via Truth Social on the occasion of the United States' 250th Independence Day, has quickly gained traction online for its unusual tone and message. Titled as ‘Best life evolution video of President Donald J Trump’, featuring Trump’s evolution from childhood to his vast business and political career.It opens with his early years, including his time at the New York Military Academy from 1959 to 1964, and follows through to his takeover of the Trump Organization, his business ventures, and eventual entry into politics. The video also highlights moments when Trump says he was “pressured and attacked” during his political career and survived a near assassination attempt.Midway through the video, a caption reads, “Lost 2020 elections but remain committed to MAGA,” marking a notable departure from Trump's previous statements.Trump has repeatedly claimed that the 2020 election was “rigged” or stolen. In a 2024 appearance on the Lex Fridman podcast, he said, “I think the election was a fraud, and many people felt it was that, and they wanted answers.”After the 2020 election, Trump pursued numerous challenges to the results in key battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.","US President Donald Trump has shared a video where he, for the first time, acknowledged his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. The video, posted on July 4 via Truth Social on the occasion of the United States' 250th Independence Day, has quickly gained traction online for its unusual tone and message.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122259746,imgsize-712767,width-400,resizemode-4/122259746.jpg"

‘Never heard that’: Donald Trump says he's unaware ‘shylock’ is considered anti-Semitic; faces backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/never-heard-that-donald-trump-says-hes-unaware-shylock-is-considered-anti-semitic-faces-backlash/articleshow/122256495.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





US President Donald Trump said early Friday that he didn’t realize the term “Shylock” is considered antisemitic by some people. He had used the word during a rally to criticize certain bankers while discussing his newly passed tax cut and spending legislation, a comment that drew widespread criticism.“I’ve never heard it that way. To me, Shylock is somebody that’s a money lender at high rates,” Trump spoke to reporters after stepping off Air Force One. “I’ve never heard it that way, you view it differently than me. I’ve never heard that.”T rump was heading back to Washington after the event in Iowa that marked the start of nationwide celebrations for the country’s 250th anniversary, which will take place next year.In his speech, he used the word while highlighting parts of the major domestic policy bill that Congress had passed just a few hours earlier.""Think of that: No death tax. No estate tax. No going to the banks and borrowing from, in some cases, a fine banker - and in some cases, Shylocks and bad people,” he said during remarks at an Iowa rally.The term “Shylock” comes from the character in William Shakespeare’s play The Merchant of Venice.In the play, Shylock is a Jewish moneylender known for being harsh and demanding, famously insisting on a “pound of flesh” from a merchant named Antonio if a loan wasn’t repaid.""The term 'Shylock' evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope about Jews and greed that is extremely offensive and dangerous. President Trump's use of the term is very troubling and irresponsible,"" the Anti-Defamation League said in a post on X.“It underscores how lies and conspiracies about Jews remain deeply entrenched in our country. Words from our leaders matter and we expect more from the President of the United States,” the organisation added.US Representative Dan Goldman, a Jewish Democrat, said, ""This is blatant and vile antisemitism, and Trump knows exactly what he’s doing.""Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a post on social media, “Shylock is among the most quintessential antisemitic stereotypes. This is not an accident. It follows years in which Trump has normalized antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories - and it’s deeply dangerous.”","The term 'Shylock' evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope about Jews and greed that is extremely offensive and dangerous.

Most of those deals have yet to materialise, and businesses in the US have been left guessing what levies they would be expected to pay on virtually every imported product.Some of them could be even steeper than originally announced, Trump said in brief remarks to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base upon returning from a rally in Iowa on Thursday. ""So we're going to start sending letters out to various countries starting tomorrow,"" said Trump, hours after his major domestic policy bill passed the House of Representatives.

Marking a high-profile legislative win early in his second term, US President Donald Trump on Friday signed what he called the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" into law during a celebratory Fourth of July ceremony at the White House.The landmark measure, described by Trump as delivering on several key campaign promises, includes broad tax cuts, significant boosts to military and immigration enforcement spending, and steep reductions in Medicaid -- elements that have drawn both praise and criticism across party lines.“It’s really promises made, promises kept,” Trump said, addressing a crowd of supporters gathered on the South Lawn, with First Lady Melania Trump standing beside him. The signing event featured military flyovers and appearances by congressional leaders.The Department of Homeland Security also hailed the bill, highlighting the $165 billion in appropriations it received.In a post on X, the department wrote: “President Trump is keeping his promises and delivering results for the American people. With a historic $165 billion in appropriations for DHS, this legislation gives DHS the resources we need to deliver on the President’s promises to deport criminal illegal aliens, secure our borders, and make America safe again.”The legislation cements major pillars of Trump’s second-term agenda, following intense negotiations in a divided Congress. While Trump and his allies celebrated the bill as a major victory, provisions like the Medicaid cuts have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans.","US President Donald Trump on Friday signed what he called the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" into law.

‘Criminalized for being stateless’: Newlywed held by ICE for 140 days says was denied basic rights; officials defend detention,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/criminalized-for-being-stateless-newlywed-held-by-ice-for-140-days-says-was-denied-basic-rights-officials-defend-detention/articleshow/122257661.cms,"Ward Sakeik (WFAAWFAA)





A newlywed bride from Texas, who was released from immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) custody on Thursday, said she was treated like ""cattle"" during her time in detention.Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman married to a US citizen, spoke publicly for the first time since being detained at a Miami airport in February. She had been held in ICE custody for 140 days after returning from her honeymoon.After arriving back from the US Virgin Islands with her husband Taahir Shaikh, Sakeik said, ""I was put in a gray tracksuit and shackles immediately,"" during a press conference held in Dallas-Fort Worth.""I was handcuffed for 16 hours without any water or food on the bus. I was moved around like cattle,"" Sakeik added.However, department of homeland security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told newsportal Newsweek, ""Any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.""""All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers.Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Meals are certified by dietitians,"" she said.US President Donald Trump has vowed to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in US history. In the early months of his second term, his administration has already deported over 100,000 people. The White House has stated that anyone living in the country without legal status is considered a ""criminal.""Meanwhile, deaths in ICE detention centers are on track to exceed last year's numbers, with 12 people confirmed to have died in custody since October 2024. Advocacy groups have blamed the rising toll on what they describe as the Trump administration’s ""increased and aggressive"" detention policies.ICE attempted to deport Ward Sakeik in the early hours of June 30, despite a federal court order blocking her removal, just one day before her eventual release.According to her legal team, Sakeik was woken up by guards around 5 am local time on Monday and told to get ready to leave the facility immediately. This marked the second time ICE had tried to deport her in violation of court orders.The first attempt occurred on June 12, when ICE officers escorted her to the tarmac at Fort Worth Alliance airport, informing her she was being deported to ""the border of Israel."" This was despite the government being aware that Sakeik is stateless and has no legal route to citizenship in either Israel or the West Bank.""These deportations, they just happened all of a sudden, I was not given a phone call,"" Sakeik said at the press conference.She explained that while she eventually managed to contact her husband, ""a phone call was not provided to me from ICE.""""I just had to wait and take a very, very long time to pack my stuff to just buy time to wait for the phone system to work to call Taahir,"" she said.Sakeik also shared that ""there were multiple days where it would be 36 hours, 50 hours, where I was not allowed to make a phone call to my attorney or my husband.""Around the time of her wedding in January, she had applied for a green card and successfully passed the initial stage of the process. Due to her immigration status, the couple chose to honeymoon in the US Virgin Islands to avoid international travel.Despite her pending green card application and documents outlining her complex immigration background, Sakeik was detained upon return.She was born in Saudi Arabia but does not hold citizenship there, and came to the United States with her family at the age of 8.""I have been a law-abiding resident of the United States since I was 8 years old. I went to college. I run a successful wedding photography business here in [Dallas-Fort Worth],"" Sakeik said.""My family did come here in 2011 seeking asylum, and we have followed all immigration policies and have complied with every single thing, every single document, every single piece of paper, every single thing that was thrown at us,"" she added.However, McLaughlin said, ""Ward Sakeik was not 'complying with immigration policies.' The facts are she is in our country illegally.""After the family's asylum request was denied, they were not deported due to their stateless status. Instead, they were placed under an order of supervision, which required them to report to immigration authorities once a year.“Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Why does the media continue to fall for the sob stories of illegal aliens in detention and villainize ICE law enforcement?”, McLaughlin added.She added that Sakeik “overstayed her visa” and has had a final removal order for over a decade, stating that President Trump and secretary Kristi Noem are committed to fixing visa system abuses.At a press conference, Ward Sakeik said, “The humanity that I was taught in school growing up is not the humanity that I’ve seen. It was stripped away from me.”“I lost five months of my life because I was criminalized for being stateless, something I have absolutely no control over. I didn’t choose to be stateless,” she added.","Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman married to a US citizen, spoke publicly for the first time since being detained at a Miami airport in February.

Indian diaspora in Africa identify as Africans, the woman said.





Amid the controversy over New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani 's race, a woman supported Mamdani identifying himself as an African though not by blood and said the entire Indian diaspora in Africa identifies as African. ""...because we are! From! Africa!"" the woman, Sophia Babai, wrote on BlueSky.The woman explained that her parents are from the same diaspora as Zohran's father Mahmood Mamdani and they will always introduce themselves as African, and there is nothing wrong in it.Sophia explained that Americans don't understand the extent to which the Indian diaspora in East Africa is a separate culture in itself. She said that compared to Indians, they eat different food, follow a different branch of Islam and have a culture of their own, which is not Indian. Their language is stuffed with Swahili and they look different from Indians.""It is also just incredibly funny seeing white Americans claim that Zohran can’t identify as African because he isn’t Black, like sir ma’am where do you think white people came from,"" the woman said explaining how a group called Lohana who are believed to be from Lahore ended up in Guajarat and Punjab and later converted -- tracing the roots of Mamdani's family.""Every Gujarati African I have ever met identifies as African first, and probably Indian second but possibly not Indian at all. Indians certainly consider us African, to a point where more traditional Indians will not intermarry with us, even if they are ethnically and religiously identical,"" the woman explained.The post came in reaction to a major row over Zohran Mamdani claiming himself to be African-American or Black in the application for Columbia University. Though he did not get into Columbia, the revelation that he attempted at a faulty racial identity triggered a political storm, though Mamdani said he was not aiming to gain anything but was trying to capture his diverse background as he was born in Uganda.","Woman's post on Gujarati African diaspora in connection with Mamdani went viral.

Multiple people have died in Texas after heavy rains triggered flash floods, with rescue teams using boats to save those trapped in fast-moving waters on Friday. The flooding impacted riverfront areas near wildlife zones and campgrounds.Central Kerr county was hit especially hard, with up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain falling within a few hours overnight. The sudden downpour caused the Guadalupe river to overflow, leading to dangerous flooding.Judge Rob Kelly, the top elected official in the county, confirmed that there had been fatalities and said dozens of water rescues had taken place. However, he declined to give an exact number, saying authorities are still working to identify the victims.“Most of them, we don’t know who they are,” Kelly said at a press briefing. “One of them was completely naked, he didn’t have any ID on him at all. We’re trying to get the identity of these folks, but we don’t have it yet.”Authorities are continuing rescue and recovery efforts as the region remains on alert for further rain.Officials carried out several rescue operations as emergency services continued their efforts, with some people still missing, according to Kelly.On Thursday afternoon, a flood watch was issued, warning of possible heavy rainfall of up to 7 inches (17 cm). By night, this alert was upgraded to a flood warning, affecting at least 30,000 people.When asked about the sudden flash floods overnight, Kelly admitted there was no warning system in place. “We didn’t know this flood was coming,” he said, even as local reporters pointed out earlier alerts and questioned the lack of preparation.“No one expected a flood of this scale,” Kelly added. “We experience floods often, but this is the most dangerous river valley in the United States.”Texas governor Greg Abbott said the state is sending help to flood-affected areas in Hill Country, including Kerrville, Ingram and Hunt.He urged people to follow instructions from authorities and stay updated with local weather forecasts to avoid driving through flooded roads.“I urge Texans to heed guidance from state and local officials and monitor local forecasts to avoid driving into flooded areas,” Abbott said in a statement.The Texas Hill Country, known for its scenic views, rocky terrain, vineyards, and vacation rentals, lies west of the state capital and is a popular summer destination. However, some parts of the region are highly prone to flash floods.Following the floods, dozens of people took to Facebook, seeking information about their children, nieces, nephews, or relatives who were attending camps or camping in the area over the holiday weekend.","Roughly 10 inches of rain fell in a few hours overnight in central Texas.

A 9-year-old has tragically died after she was left unattended inside a hot car deliberately by her mother on Tuesday, who was away at work, as per the Harris County, Texas, sheriff, Ed Gonzalez.According to the sheriff’s office the mother, 36, left her 9-year-old daughter in white Toyota Camry from 6 am to 2pm while she was working at a manufacturing plant in Galena Park, Texas, near Houston. She had partially rolled the windows and left the child with some water and then ""proceeded to go to work for the day,"" said officials, as reported by ABC.Temperatures in the Houston area were as high as 93 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, as reported by the National Weather Service.""There's never an excuse to leave a child unattended,"" Gonzalez said during the press conference.""Maybe she has to make ends meet and keep food on the table and work. But the risk of death or harm -- there's just no reconciling that in my mind. You got to make other arrangements. It's not worth it to put a child at risk like this, for any particular reason,"" he added.“I don’t know if anyone checked on the child throughout the day,” said Gonzalez, reported New York Post.After her shift ended the mother returned to the car and found the child unresponsive. Around 2 pm law enforcement was contacted and the mother was detained. The child was declared dead after she was taken to a local hospital.Detectives are still questioning the mother to better understand why the child was left in the car and to establish a clear timeline of how long she was alone, the sheriff said. Authorities are also awaiting the results of the child’s autopsy before determining whether any charges will be filed and the mother is no longer under detainment.Gonzalez said the situation could have been “prevented” and is a “unique situation” as most car deaths are typically accidents. He also added that nothing currently indicates that the mother ""thought this would be the outcome.""This tragedy is not the first one as it is the third hot car death in Texas and the thirteenth one across the nation, according to Kids and Car Safety, an organization that “saves the lives of children and pets in and around vehicles.""","A 9-year-old has tragically died after she was left unattended inside a hot car deliberately by her mother on Tuesday, who was away at work.

Amna Baloch and three other Baloch activists were detained by police in Karachi during a peaceful protest on Thursday, reported The Balochistan Post.The demonstration was organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) in Lyari against the alleged extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a youth activist from Balochistan and member of BYC’s Panjgur Organising Committee.Zeeshan had been campaigning for years to find his father, Zaheer Ahmed Baloch, who was forcibly disappeared in 2015.Zeeshan’s body was found in Panjgur on 30 June, a day after he was reportedly abducted by a state-backed militia. He had been shot multiple times.His death has led to anger and protests across Balochistan. The BYC has called Zeeshan’s killing another example of state repression against Baloch activists.Thursday’s protest in Karachi was supposed to begin from Lyari’s 8 Chowk. However, before the march could start, police stopped the demonstrators and used force to break up the gathering.In a statement shared on X, BYC said Amna Baloch and three others—Suhail, Irfan, and one unnamed protester—were taken to Risala Police Station. The group condemned the arrests and demanded their immediate release.“This is not the first time that our peaceful protests have faced state repression in Karachi,” the BYC said. “The state must be held accountable for its crimes. Silencing dissent will not bury the truth.”",Amna Baloch and three other Baloch activists were detained by police in Karachi during a peaceful protest on Thursday.

Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July, calling it ""a profound affront to global human rights"" and a dangerous move that threatens global stability.In a post on X, Marri accused the UN of legitimising a state he described as built on oppression and deception. “When the accused are handed the gavel, international credibility erodes,” Marri said, warning that privilege has replaced accountability in global diplomacy.Referring to a recent statement by Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN on promoting peace and diplomacy, Marri called it ironic. “The very country preaching peace today has exported terrorism and jihad while practising religious persecution at home,” he stated.Marri cited Pakistan’s alleged historical record of human rights abuses, including its involvement in the killing of Afghans during decades of conflict, the 1971 genocide of Bengalis, and its role in the suppression of Palestinians during General Zia-ul-Haq’s tenure. “Then-Brigadier Zia allegedly murdered thousands of Palestinians in Jordan,” Marri said.He accused Pakistan of continuing its violent campaign against the Baloch people since annexing Balochistan in 1948, in what he described as a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.“Pakistan has forcefully killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of Baloch,” he said.Marri recalled key betrayals in Baloch history, including the imprisonment of Prince Abdul Kareem, the younger brother of the Khan of Kalat, who was jailed for 17 years after seeking negotiations, and the hanging of the sons of Nawab Nauroz Khan despite Pakistan's sworn assurance of safe talks. “Pakistan swore on the Quran to honour the talks, then publicly desecrated it twice,” Marri said.He further warned that Pakistan remains an artificial and militarised state, dominated by a Punjabi elite that suppresses minority national identities through enforced disappearances, torture, religious conversions, and extrajudicial killings.Marri concluded by urging the international community to reconsider its engagement with Pakistan. “Your decision lends moral sanction to a regime steeped in terror and oppression. Accountability must never yield to privilege,” he said, calling on democratic nations to revoke Pakistan’s UNSC presidency and recognise it as a rogue state.","Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July.
