Rahul seeks early start to talks on TN seat sharing as Kanimozhi calls on him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-seeks-early-start-to-talks-on-tn-seat-sharing-as-kanimozhi-calls-on-him/articleshow/127756164.cms,"NEW DELHI: DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday, where Congress urged the southern partner to start the already delayed discussions on seat-sharing for the coming Tamil Nadu elections.The visuals of Kanimozhi visiting Rahul settled the uncertainty triggered by public chatter on the alliance. During a meeting this month, the Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had reportedly conveyed to the TN leaders that alliance with DMK was in place and urged them to stop public comments on the issue.According to sources, the talks between Kanimozhi and Rahul were pleasant in which the DMK expressed its respect for Congress. However, Rahul is learnt to have said that the DMK should start talks on seat-sharing with the committee formed by Congress president Kharge.The AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Girish Chodankar on Tuesday said he was waiting for the last two months for the DMK to initiate discussions with the Congress panel, an exasperation shared by the party in general.It is learnt that Congress has presented the DMK with a list of 41 seats, but the lead TN partner is reluctant to concede the demand.Congress had sought 41 seats in 2021 polls but was given to contest only 25.While the stress was on initiating the seat-sharing talks, sources said no numbers were discussed between the Gandhi scion and the DMK emissary.Though staunch allies since 2004, the Congress and DMK ties have witnessed rumblings in recent months, with a section of state Congress seeking more seats and a share in future govt. Some have even touted the newbie TVK of movie star Vijay as an option.But DMK is averse to sharing power, having run a single-party govt in the state despite leading a rainbow alliance of multiple outfits.However, the AICC panel is still likely to broach the demand for power-sharing when it discusses seats with the DMK.The TN polls are set to be an exciting contest, with AIADMK, reportedly under pressure from BJP, agreeing to include its breakaway factions in a grand alliance that includes the BJP. The other political pole is TVK that has created a buzz with the star power of Vijay drawing large crowds. While the DMK has been confident of its prospects after its sweep of 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the emergence of TVK has raised concerns in some quarters.",DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday.

West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

New Delhi: RJD MP Manoj Jha on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to classify voters as non-citizens or to delete them from electoral rolls as it can only flag people with doubtful citizenship to the Union govt, which alone can decide citizenship disputes.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jha, told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that EC cannot strike off names of voters from electoral roll by terming their citizenship doubtful and deprive them of their valuable democratic right to choose their representative.Reiterating a point that he has made in almost every case that touched upon elections be it EVMs or constitutional amendments, Sibal said, “The judgment that the court will render in this case will be no ordinary one, for it will decide the future of democracy of India.”Sprinkling his criticism of SIR and the alleged opaque process adopted by EC with repeated refrains of “not fair”, Sibal said once the EC flags a doubtful citizenship case to the Centre, it must not remove the voter’s name from electoral roll till the govt decided the dispute over citizenship.Justice Bagchi said once an objection to a person’s citizenship is raised before the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO), she will seek documentary proof and hear parties to decide the citizenship dispute.How can ERO decide who is an illegal migrant, Sibal asked, adding that crores of voters are being deleted on flimsy grounds.CJI Kant-led bench said a hue and cry was raised over deletion of 65 lakh names from Bihar voters list. Did a single person file an appeal, it asked and said the initial apprehensions about large-scale deletion did not come true. He said the EC has not given a single reason why it is conducting pan-India SIR, as is required under the mandate to EC for carrying out special revision of electoral rolls. Why is such an exercise required to be done near the elections, EC has no answer, he said.Social activist Yogendra Yadav said wherever SIR was conducted, the ratio of female voters has declined. The large-scale deletion of women voters is because of the technically faulty SIR, he said, adding that because only special revision was carried out in Assam the ratio of women voters increased.A tired bench of CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi, which has been hearing arguments on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of SIR spread over the past three months, told the petitioners’ counsel to conclude their arguments in 45 minutes on Thursday.","RJD MP Manoj Jha told the Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to classify voters as non-citizens.

Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path.

‘Phone tapping govt’: BJP accuses Siddaramaiah-led Congress of spying on governor’s phone in Karnataka Assembly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/phone-tapping-govt-bjp-accuses-siddaramaiah-led-congress-of-spying-on-governors-phone-in-karnataka-assembly/articleshow/127703511.cms,"Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah (PTI image)

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

NEW DELHI: Proceedings in the Karnataka Assembly were disrupted on Wednesday after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Congress-led Siddaramaiah government of phone tapping.The house was in total ruckus following law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil remarks who suggested that the governor Thaawarchand Gehlot was acting on instructions received through calls from Delhi.The controversy erupted during the debate on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address to the joint sitting of the state legislature. BJP legislators alleged that the Congress government had accessed details of phone calls received at the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan), raising serious questions about surveillance and misuse of power.Last week, on January 22, governor Gehlot refused to read the full state-prepared address to the joint session of the legislature and concluded his speech in just three lines.The move drew sharp criticism from the Congress government. The governor had objected to certain references in the address that were critical of the Centre, including remarks on the alleged “repeal” of the UPA-era employment guarantee scheme, MGNREGA.Intervening in the debate on Wednesday, BJP MLA Suresh Kumar accused the state government of disrespecting the governor and making unwarranted allegations against a constitutional authority. He observed that there have been earlier instances where governors did not read their full addresses.Citing precedent, Kumar referred to January 2011, when the BJP was in power in the state. He said that then governor Hansraj Bhardwaj had tabled his address to the joint session to be treated as read after the then Leader of the Opposition, Siddaramaiah, urged him not to read it, alleging corruption by the BJP government at the time.Responding to this comparison, law minister H K Patil alleged that the present Governor had acted under instructions received over phone calls from Delhi.“Following calls from Delhi the Governor did not read the full speech, we will also have to speak about it now, as you spoke about the earlier incident (involving then Governor Bhardwaj),” Patil said.The remark triggered strong protests from the BJP benches. Suresh Kumar said that the law minister was making a grave allegation and questioned how the government knew about calls to the governor.“Is the government tapping the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan) phones, to know about the Governor getting calls from Delhi?” he asked.As BJP MLAs rose in protest, the House descended into chaos. BJP MLA Sunil Kumar alleged that Patil’s statement amounted to an admission. “How can this be tolerated? This is the second time the Law Minister has said this in the House. Is phone tapping happening?” he said.IT/BT Minister Priyank Kharge came to Patil’s defence, saying the law minister was only alleging that the Governor was acting like a “puppet in the hands of the central government.” However, the BJP maintained that the statements raised serious doubts about surveillance at the Raj Bhavan.Escalating the exchange, Kharge alleged that the governor was receiving calls from Keshava Krupa, the RSS’s Karnataka state headquarters. BJP members countered the claim by saying the Congress “gets calls from Italy,” further intensifying the verbal sparring.Sunil Kumar and other BJP MLAs reiterated their charge that the state government had stooped to tapping the Governor’s phone. “The Law Minister has repeatedly said that the Governor was getting calls from Delhi. How did they know? If they have records, let them place it in the House,” he said, alleging that both Patil and Kharge were involved in tapping phones at Lok Bhavan.Senior BJP leaders, including Suresh Kumar and Sunil Kumar, continued to accuse the Siddaramaiah government of surveillance and described it as a “phone tapping government.” Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka also backed the allegations.Replying to the charges, Patil questioned why there had been no clarification from either the Governor or the Centre after he first made the allegation last week. “What is the Home Ministry doing in Delhi? Should they not at least issue a press note saying that there is no communication between the Governor and Home Ministry?” he asked.The remarks led to further heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches, with Ashoka claiming that the statements by Patil and Kharge themselves proved that phones at the Lok Bhavan and the RSS office were being tapped. “Are our phones also being tapped? This is a phone-tapping government,” he said.As disorder continued in the House, Speaker U T Khader adjourned the Assembly for lunch.",Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil suggested that the governor Thaawarchand Gehlot was acting on instructions received through calls from Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati on Wednesday ended his sit-in protest and departed the Magh Mela in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj, 10 days after he was ""stopped"" from taking a holy dip at the Sangam.Before leaving, he said he was returning with a “sense of emptiness” and a “heavy heart.”“Today, words are not supporting me, and my voice feels heavy. We come to this sacred land of Prayagraj seeking spiritual peace, but today we are returning with a sense of emptiness and a heavy heart that we had never imagined,” the seer told reporters, PTI reported.“Taking a dip in the Sangam is a path to the satisfaction of the inner soul, but my mind is so distressed today that I am leaving without taking a bath,” he added.Commenting on the developments at Prayagraj, Avimukteshwaranand remarked they had “shaken my inner self” and prompted him to raise questions about “collective faith in justice and humanity.”On January 18, Swami Avimukteshwaranand was travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam—the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati—on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya when a dispute erupted after administrative and police officials asked him to dismount and proceed on foot for the ritual bath, citing heavy crowds.The Mela administration alleged that the seer and his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge and moved towards the ghats, creating serious challenges for the police in crowd management.Following the incident, allegations were exchanged between Avimukteshwaranand and the police administration, after which he launched a sit-in protest.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav attacked the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government following the seer’s announcement, calling his departure from the Magh Mela without bathing in the Sangam an “extremely ominous” incident.“The BJP's arrogance broke a tradition that has continued since time immemorial. Jagadguru Shankaracharya ji leaving the Magh Mela on the sacred land of Prayagraj without taking a holy bath is an extremely ominous incident,” Yadav wrote on X.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister stated that the entire Sanatan community was not only hurt but also gripped by fear. “The global Sanatan society is deeply pained and filled with an uncertain sense of apprehension,” he posted.Yadav alleged that the ruling party could have acted differently but was “blinded by power”.“If the BJP and its associates wanted, they could have shed the arrogance of power, carried him on their shoulders and ensured his sacred bath at the Triveni Sangam, thereby upholding his honour. The BJP is intoxicated with the pride of power acquired through corrupt means, which is stopping it from doing so,” the SP president added.He said hurting saints could never bring well-being. “No one can attain happiness by hurting the hearts of saints. A bigger mistake than committing an error is not seeking forgiveness,” Yadav said, adding that “no political post can be greater than the honour of saints”.Invoking religious texts, he warned of consequences over the developments involving the seer. “Do those who create obstacles in religious rituals need to be told what they are called? Our epics clearly state that no wrongdoer ever escapes the punishment of arrogance,” he said.Yadav concluded his post with the message: “Hurt saints mean the end of power.”","Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati ended his sit-in protest and departed the Magh Mela in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj.

“Deeply Saddened by His Passing”: PM Modi, HM Shah Mourn Ajit Pawar’s Untimely Death

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders on Wednesday demanded a thorough investigation into the plane crash that killed Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and four others. The calls are being ranged from a DGCA-led probe to a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry.Ajit Pawar (66) was among five people killed when a Learjet 45 aircraft crash-landed near Baramati airport in Pune district on Wednesday morning. The aircraft was operated by Delhi-based VSR Ventures and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said there were five people on board, including crew members.Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh expressed his condolences over the death of NCP leader. Raising concerns over the circumstances of the crash, he said that several questions needed to be answered, including visibility conditions, landing protocol and aircraft maintenance.“The question is, why did this accident happen? From the preliminary information I have received, a similar accident involving the same company occurred in Mumbai three years ago. This incident took place in low visibility. Normally, landing should not be attempted unless visibility is at least five kilometres,” he said.Singh added that the aircraft reportedly attempted to land twice before missing the airstrip.“The DGCA should conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. It must also be examined who was responsible for the aircraft’s maintenance and whether DGCA clearance had been granted,” Singh said.Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also called for a probe, describing Pawar’s death as untimely and deeply shocking.“We will demand an investigation into this accident. It is a very sad incident. Ajit Pawar died a premature death. The passing away of a hard-working man has shocked us all. We are with his family in this hour,” Kharge said.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, Kharge said Pawar had worked for the people and his death had hurt everyone. “This has hurt everyone, including his family members, and we share their grief and pray that they can bear this loss,” he said.Earlier, in a post on X, Kharge said Pawar’s death was “deeply shocking and profoundly distressing,” calling it an untimely loss of a leader with a long political career ahead. He said Pawar would be remembered as a seasoned politician who served Maharashtra in various constitutional roles.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee demanded a Supreme Court-supervised inquiry and alleging that existing agencies could not be trusted.“We trust only the Supreme Court. All other agencies have been completely compromised,” Banerjee told reporters before leaving for Singur, asserting that only a court-monitored probe would bring out the truth.She also alleged a possible political conspiracy, claiming there were reports that Pawar was considering leaving the BJP days before the crash.“Two days ago, I came to know that someone from another party had given a statement that Pawar was willing to leave the BJP, and now this has happened today,” she said, while adding that Pawar was reportedly preparing to return to the NCP faction led by his uncle Sharad Pawar.“It is truly a great loss. My condolences to his family, the people of Maharashtra, and to Sharad Pawar,” Banerjee said.The Biju Janta Dal also joined other opposition parties in demanding a thorough investigation.BJD VP Debi Prasad Mishra said, “It is shocking news that Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra and a regional party leader, died in a plane crash at Baramati. He was a vibrant leader with a strong reputation as a doer, held important portfolios in Maharashtra, and worked extensively for the people. He was also the cousin of the legendary leader Sharad Pawar. This is very unfortunate, and the matter should be thoroughly investigated. ”",Ajit Pawar was among five people killed when a Learjet 45 aircraft crash-landed near Baramati airport in Pune district on Wednesday morning.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

A Green Card holder from India took to Reddit, claiming that his LinkedIn profile was being checked by someone at USCIS even though his Green Card case was closed in 2024. The Reddit post of the man claiming that it freaked him out to find out that USCIS officials are still keeping an eye on him has spread alarm at a time when the US has tightened its overall vetting processes and H-1B visa holders in India are facing stamping delays because of the newly introduced social media vetting.The North Carolina Redditor claimed his LinkedIn profile was first viewed by a case officer and then by lawyers. The man said he came to the US in 2015 on an F-1 student visa and then got into STEM OPT until he was picked up by the H-1B lottery in 2020.The man said he got married in 2021 to an Indian-origin citizen in the US and applied for a marriage-based Green Card in 2023. It was approved in January 2024 without any interview as it was a 10-year no-condition Green Card as his marriage was, by then, already over 2 years.The Redditor revealed that he has no criminal record but only a speeding ticket before his Green Card approval from 2023.

Massive avalanche strikes Warwan Valley in Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar; locals warned to avoid vulnerable areas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/massive-avalanche-strikes-warwan-valley-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-kishtwar-locals-warned-to-avoid-vulnerable-areas/articleshow/127755740.cms,"



SRINAGAR: A massive avalanche hit the remote Warwan valley in Jammu and Kashmir 's Kishtwar district on Wednesday morning.The SHO Warwan Zaheer Iqbal said no injury or damage to property was reported in the area. He said they have advised people to stay away from avalanche-prone areas as severe weather conditions persist.The incident comes a day after a high-intensity avalanche hit the Sonamarg area of central Kashmir, leading to snow dust engulfing houses and vehicles.For Nazir Ahmad Sheikh, a hotelier at Sonamarg Inn, whose CCTV footage showed a snow storm sweeping through the area on Tuesday evening triggering widespread alarm, the incident was a usual thing. “I didn’t panic. Avalanches like this occur here every year,” he said.Sheikh said the avalanche struck the opposite side, roughly half a km from the Sonamarg village, and ended in the Sindh River. He said powerful winds generated by the avalanche lifted soft snow and blew it across the village, giving the impression that the avalanche had hit Sonamarg village housing hotels, restaurants and shops.“It was the wind lifting soft snow. I was inside the hotel and watched it through the window.It settled in about three minutes, and everything was normal after that. We then stepped outside to check and found everything normal,” he said.Dr Sunil Dhar, Head of the Department of Environmental Sciences at the Central University of Jammu, agrees. “Given the videos I saw, it appeared to be a cloud of snow dust. Had it been a full avalanche, these buildings there would have got damaged. When an avalanche occurs, air escapes from the snow slab leading to powerful gusts of wind. This trapped air carries fine snow particles forming a snow cloud,” Prof Dhar said.Dr Irfan Rashid, from the department of geoinformatics, University of Kashmir said that it is usual that avalanches get triggered due to snowfall. He said topography, steep slopes with less vegetation, are apt sites for the trigger and Sonamarg fits in it perfectly. “What adds fuel to fire is high ambient temperatures, heat in the system that not only aids in snowmelt but lubricates the soil-snow interface triggering snow avalanche,” he addedSonamarg, which used to remain cut off during the winter months, has remained open throughout the season since the inauguration of the Z-Morh (Sonamarg) Tunnel on January 13, 2025, which provides all-weather road access by bypassing avalanche-prone stretches of the old route. The Z-Morh Tunnel is a 6.5 km long 2-lane road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonamarg. It is named after the Z-shaped stretch of road that the tunnel has replaced. The road used before was avalanche-prone and often got blocked for several months. However, the Z-Morh tunnel provides all-weather connectivity to the Sonamarg tourist resort.Sheikh said locals are familiar with sudden weather changes in the area and they didn’t panic. He is now worried about the AI generated videos of the incident. Such videos, he said, are not good as tourists have started returning to the resort and AI generated videos are bound to create panic.In the last three years, the Sonamarg area has seen avalanches in the winters. A massive snow avalanche set off from mountains on Jan 12, 2023 killing two labourers. Then another snow avalanche hit on Jan 14, 2023, transporting about 50000 m3 of snow. But no loss of life was reported. Another large avalanche also occurred in Feb 2024, captured on camera and widely shared though without causing any injury. On March 5, 2025, a massive avalanche struck Sonamarg without causing any damage.Jammu and Kashmir Police said that the avalanche occurred Tuesday night at around 10:15 pm near the new truck yard, Sonamarg. “Fortunately, the impact was minimal and no loss of life or property has been reported.” A senior police official said locals, tourists, and transporters are advised to strictly avoid visiting or halting in avalanche-prone areas. “The chances of avalanches remain very high, and unnecessary movement in vulnerable zones can pose serious risks,” the official said.",Avalanche hit remote Warwan valley in Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar district.

China has executed 11 members of the Ming family, a powerful clan that ran large-scale scam centres and gambling operations in Myanmar.A court in Zhejiang province had sentenced the family members in September for a range of crimes, including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens, reported BBC.The executions mark one of the most significant outcomes of China’s recent crackdown on cross-border scam networks.The Ming family was among several clans that effectively controlled Laukkaing, a town in Myanmar near the Chinese border. Once a remote and impoverished area, Laukkaing was transformed under their influence into a hub of casinos, scam centres and red-light districts.According to the court, the family’s criminal operations generated more than 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) between 2015 and 2023. The activities led to the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others.The group’s downfall began in 2023, when Myanmar authorities arrested the Ming family members and handed them over to China. The move followed sustained pressure from Beijing as it stepped up efforts to curb telecom fraud and illegal gambling operations targeting Chinese nationals.The case reflects on China’s hardline stance against overseas scam syndicates and signals continued cooperation with neighbouring countries to dismantle networks operating beyond its borders.","The Ming family was among several clans that effectively controlled Laukkaing, a town in Myanmar near the Chinese border.

PUNE: The mortal remains of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar were on Thursday brought to his residence in Katewadi ahead of his last rites.Funeral preparations are underway at the Vidya Pratishthan ground in Baramati for the Nationalist Congress leader who lost his life in a plane crash on Wednesday. NCP has always been associated with the Pawar family, nobody has thought of a member other than one from the Pawar family leading either group.Considering the sympathy factor, Sunetra can be the option to not only lead the party but also negotiate merger talks with the other group, who are also part of her family,” political analyst Prakash Pawar said. However, a decision to merge will not be easy.On the one hand, senior NCP MLAs, who are part of the Mahayuti govt, will insist on continuing in govt, while those with Sharad Pawar ’s group in opposition will not want their group to compromise on Phule-Ambedkar-Shahu’s ideology.Ajit Pawar’s presence helped the Pawars carry out a balancing act. Now the two groups will have to arrive at a joint political stand. NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar and its working president, Supriya Sule , will have to take a call on joining the NDA at the national level and Mahayuti at the state level, if they want to take ownership of the NCP merger, because asking NCP MLAs to step out of the Mahayuti alliance may lead to some of them switching to Shiv Sena or BJP.The other scenario is if 85-year-old Sharad Pawar, whose ill health has kept him from electioneering after the assembly election in 2024, takes the lead for a merger.Prakash Pawar said Sharad Pawar could get Supriya and state NCP (SP) chief Jayant Patil to revive the party, but its political stand will have to be clear. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare and working president Praful Patel are likely to play important roles in deciding its path, but they lack overall acceptance within their group and don’t enjoy a mass base like the Pawars.",Ajit Pawar’s presence helped the Pawars carry out a balancing act.

Singer-rapper Nicki Minaj, a critic turned supporter of Donald Trump, hailed the US President making a TikTok video with him, praising his leadership, and later sharing a picture of what she described as “Trump’s Gold Card” on social media.In the TikTok video, Minaj introduced Trump by saying, “Hello guys, I'm with my favorite President. The best of all times.” Trump responded, “And I’m with the ‘Queen of Rap.’” The clip has since circulated widely online.Separately, Minaj posted on X a photograph of Trump’s Gold Card. The card has been introduced by Trump to pave the way towards American citizenship for the rich, and a fast track residency in the US for people on work visas.Minaj’s remarks came during her appearance at a US treasury department event in Washington, DC, where she openly expressed her support for Trump. According to PBS News, the rapper described herself as his most ardent supporter.“I am probably the president's No. 1 fan, and that's not going to change,” she said. “The hate or what people have to say, it does not affect me at all. It actually motivates me to support him more.”She also criticised what she called attempts to undermine the president. “We're not going to let them get away with bullying him and, you know, the smear campaigns. It's not going to work,” Minaj said. “He has a lot of force behind him, and God is protecting him.”The event marked the upcoming launch of “Trump accounts,” a government-backed initiative under which the federal government will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for every eligible child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Minaj announced she would contribute between $150,000 and $300,000 to help fund the programme.Minaj’s endorsement represents a notable shift from her earlier stance. During the 2020 election cycle, she had said she was “not gonna jump on the Trump bandwagon.” Her latest appearance signals a clear reversal along with her earlier acts of support for Trump, placing her among the most high-profile entertainers to publicly support Trump during his current presidency.",Nicki Minaj says she is Donald Trump's 'No. 1 fan' The rapper made a TikTok video with the US President praising his leadership.

Iran warns to hit ‘heart of Tel Aviv’

Iran trying to rebuild nuclear sites?





US President Donald Trump is strongly leaning towards a major new strike against Khamenei-led Iran after talks between Washington and Tehran on curbing Iran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missile development failed to make meaningful progress, people familiar with the matter told CNN.Two US officials briefed on the discussions told Reuters that Trump wants to create conditions for “regime change” targeting the top brass of the Islamic Republic following Iran’s violent crackdown on nationwide protests earlier this month. The unrest, sparked by economic distress and rising prices, was quelled through force, with thousands reportedly killed.According to the sources quoted by Reuters, Trump has discussed options that include targeting Iranian commanders and institutions the US holds responsible for the violence. The aim, they said, would be to embolden protesters and weaken the government’s ability to hold key security and administrative buildings.Trump has publicly warned Tehran as well. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, he demanded that Iran return to the negotiating table to agree to “a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.” He also cautioned that any future US strike would be “far worse” than the one carried out last June under Operation Midnight Hammer, when American forces hit three Iranian nuclear sites.Trump described US naval movements toward the region as an “armada” heading closer to Iran.According to CNN, Trump is weighing a range of military options, including airstrikes targeting Iran’s leadership and security officials linked to the killings, as well as strikes on nuclear facilities and key government institutions. While no final decision has been made, Trump believes his military options have expanded with the arrival of a US carrier strike group in the region earlier this month.Trump's planning on Iran also include to move one or more THAAD missile defence systems to the region, as sources told CNN.The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group entered the Indian Ocean on Monday and is continuing to move closer to Iran. It could support potential military operations, both by assisting in strikes and by protecting US allies in the region from possible Iranian retaliation.Earlier this month, the US and Iran exchanged messages in an effort to ease tensions, sources said. These contacts included mediation by Omani diplomats and direct communication between Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The talks explored the possibility of a meeting to avert a US attack that Trump had threatened following the deaths of protesters.Tehran has issued sharp warnings in response. Iranian officials have said the “heart of Tel Aviv” would be struck if the US attacks Iran. A senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of an “unprecedented” retaliation against Israel in the event of any US military action.It remains unclear why Trump has refocused attention on Iran’s nuclear programme, which he said last summer had been “obliterated” by US strikes. However, according to a person familiar with recent US intelligence, Iran has been trying to rebuild its nuclear facilities deeper underground. Tehran has long resisted US demands to halt uranium enrichment and has also barred the UN’s nuclear watchdog from inspecting its nuclear sites.Amid the growing threat of military action, the US has set strict preconditions for any talks with Iran, sources said. These include a permanent end to uranium enrichment, new limits on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, and a halt to support for Iranian proxy groups across the region.The main obstacle, according to sources, has been Washington’s demand that Iran accept limits on the range of its ballistic missiles — a major concern for Israel, which used up much of its missile interceptor stockpile while defending against Iranian attacks during last June’s 12-day war.Iran has rejected that demand and told the US it would discuss only its nuclear programme. The US has not responded, leaving negotiations at a standstill, the sources said.",US President Donald Trump is strongly leaning towards a major new strike against Iran.

US President Donald Trump has said that another American “armada” is moving towards Iran, while expressing hope that Tehran would agree to a deal with Washington, adding to tensions already high in the Middle East.Speaking at a public event in Iowa, Trump said, “By the way, there's another beautiful armada floating toward Iran right now.

Explained: Why Kanye West's swastika apology angered Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-kanye-wests-swastika-apology-angered-hindus/articleshow/127651322.cms,"What Kanye West said

Outrage Erupts As Kanye West’s Hitler-Praising Song Plays During Miami Influencer Party | WATCH.

What the Coalition of Hindus of North America said

Why the swastika is repeatedly misunderstood

How Hindus have tried to reclaim the symbol

Why this controversy matters





When US rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, published a full-page apology for antisemitic behaviour in The Wall Street Journal, he appeared to be seeking closure after years of controversy. Instead, a single line in the letter reignited a different and older debate, prompting Hindu groups to accuse him of perpetuating a historical misunderstanding that has long stigmatised a sacred religious symbol.In the paid advertisement titled “To Those I’ve Hurt”, Ye apologised for a series of antisemitic remarks, public statements and actions that had led to widespread condemnation and the collapse of several business partnerships.He attributed his behaviour to an undiagnosed frontal-lobe brain injury from a 2002 car accident and to bipolar disorder, describing how prolonged manic episodes caused him to lose touch with reality and exercise poor judgment. Reflecting on his use of Nazi imagery, Ye wrote that in a fractured mental state he “gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika,” and acknowledged selling T-shirts bearing the symbol.While the letter explicitly stated that he is “not a Nazi or an antisemite” and expressed love for Jewish people, it made no distinction between the Nazi emblem and the ancient religious symbol known as the swastika. That omission became the focal point of the backlash.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it “deeply insulting” to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.The organisation said Ye’s apology repeated a basic historical error: Adolf Hitler did not describe the Nazi symbol as a swastika. The Nazi Party referred to it as the Hakenkreuz, or “hooked cross”. According to CoHNA, equating the two symbols collapses vastly different historical and civilisational contexts into a single narrative of hate.CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified. While acknowledging Ye’s attempt to apologise for antisemitic harm, the group said accountability must not come at the cost of misrepresenting living religious traditions.The confusion between the swastika and Nazi symbolism is largely the result of early 20th-century Western reporting. As Nazi Germany rose to power, English-language media frequently translated Hakenkreuz as “swastika” for convenience, even though the Nazis themselves did not use that term.Over time, repetition turned that mistranslation into convention. In Western public consciousness, the word “swastika” became almost exclusively associated with Nazism, eclipsing its far older presence across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, where it symbolises auspiciousness, continuity and well-being.Historians argue that this collapse of meaning distorts history in two directions. Nazi ideology is inaccurately described when its own terminology is ignored, while Dharmic traditions are harmed when their sacred symbols are reduced to shorthand for European fascism. Precision, they say, is essential not only for cultural sensitivity but for historical accuracy.In recent years, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain groups have stepped up efforts to reclaim and contextualise the swastika through education campaigns, interfaith dialogue and legal advocacy. These initiatives aim to explain the difference between the Nazi Hakenkreuz and the religious swastika, particularly in schools, museums and public discourse.Some of these efforts have translated into legislative recognition in parts of North America, where lawmakers have formally acknowledged the distinction between the two symbols. Community leaders stress that reclaiming the swastika is not about downplaying Nazi atrocities, but about preventing an ancient religious emblem from being permanently defined by its 20th-century misuse.For practitioners, the issue is deeply personal. The swastika continues to be used in daily worship, festivals, weddings and rites of passage. Its mischaracterisation shapes public perception and, at times, exposes communities to suspicion or hostility.Ye’s apology illustrates how historical misunderstandings can persist even in moments intended to heal. For Hindu organisations, the issue is not the artist’s intent, but the ease with which a global public figure could repeat an error that scholars and communities have spent decades trying to correct.The episode underscores a broader lesson history offers repeatedly: when symbols are flattened and stripped of context, attempts to confront one injustice can end up creating another. As debates around hate, memory and accountability continue, Hindu groups argue that accuracy is not a technicality. It is the foundation of understanding.","Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it ‘deeply insulting’ to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.

Who is Stephen Miller? The figure at the center of the storm



What’s next in the fallout between Megyn Kelly and Kara Swisher







A sharp social media clash erupted this week between prominent American media figures over a controversial comparison made about former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. Megyn Kelly, conservative commentator and host of, reacted with outrage to a clip shared by tech journalist Kara Swisher, comparing Miller to historical figures associated with grave abuses of power. Kelly characterised this comment as dangerously extreme and potentially life-threatening.In a tweet on early Wednesday morning, Kelly wrote, “This is SICK. She’s trying to get @StephenM killed. Why else would you say he’s Himmler? Deranged and so far beyond the pale. We can’t become immune to it (sic)” amplifying the controversy and drawing intense reactions across the political spectrum.The dispute began with a video clip from thepodcast, hosted by Swisher and Scott Galloway, in which Swisher delivered a blistering critique of Miller’s role in shaping immigration policy, calling him akin to Nazis involved in internment and genocide. In the clip, Swisher said that Miller was similar to figures like Heinrich Himmler and Karl Bendetsen, the latter of whom orchestrated Japanese-American internment camps during World War II. Swisher argued that Miller would “go down in history as evil” and claimed that he had “blood on his hands. ”Swisher’s broader point was to highlight what she views as a moral responsibility for decisions in immigration enforcement, especially amid intense scrutiny of federal immigration actions that have drawn national criticism recently.Her comments, however, touched off a backlash from conservative circles.Kelly, a long-time political commentator who hosts a nationally syndicated show, seized on the video clip and accused Swisher of a rhetoric which was so incendiary that it could put Miller’s life at risk. In her tweet, she called the comparison to Himmler “sick” and “deranged”, arguing that such language can incite violence against political figures.Her tweet rapidly became a focal point of discussion across social platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), with supporters praising her defence of Miller and critics accusing Kelly of overreaction or mischaracterising Swisher’s intent. The debate taps into a larger political battle over public speech boundaries. Conservatives often argue that aggressive criticism from the left dehumanises political opponents, while progressives and critics of Miller’s policies argue that sharp comparisons are a legitimate response to what they see as harmful government conduct.Social media erupted almost instantly as Kelly’s tweet spread. Many conservatives applauded her call-out, sharing the post widely and framing Swisher’s comments as irresponsible or even violent in tone. Others on the political right used the moment to critique what they see as a double standard in how political rhetoric is judged when directed at liberal versus conservative figures online.Meanwhile, some commentators and journalists criticised Kelly’s characterisation, arguing that Swisher’s comments, while hyperbolic, were not literally advocating harm but instead using historical comparisons to underscore perceived moral failures in public policy. The clash highlights the increasingly fraught nature of political commentary in the social media age, where a single tweet can ignite broad national debates about rhetoric, responsibility and political civility.While one netizen commented, ""Millions agree with her, including yours truly (sic)"", another tweeted, ""Go f*** yourself @megynkellyYou are as disgusting as ever. And it's a very fair comparison. It's on fucking believable that you can show that motherf***** sympathy, but you trash Alex Perretti, who was actually a really good person (sic)"" and yet another reacted, ""Dems are losing their tiny minds everywhere! Republicans must be doing a great job! MAMA!! (sic).""Stephen Miller served as a senior policy adviser in the Trump White House and is widely known for shaping hard-line immigration policies. His political views have been described as far-right and heavily focused on restricting immigration; some critics over the years have labelled elements of his advocacy as extremist.Supporters see him as a principled conservative policymaker; critics see his rhetoric and policy impact as dangerously exclusionary. This deep polarisation, particularly over immigration, national identity and federal enforcement, fuels disputes like the recent one between Kelly and Swisher.The dispute is about more than two media personalities, it reflects how heated public discourse has become in the US and how historical analogies can trigger intense backlash. Critics of Swisher’s comparison argue that using charged historical figures like Heinrich Himmler, associated with atrocities, crosses a line and can make ordinary political disagreements sound like existential moral battles.The incident underlines how rhetoric that blurs sharp critique with symbolic comparison is interpreted differently depending on political alignment, contributing to deepening divisions in national political debate. Swisher’s commentary was rooted in broader criticism of current immigration enforcement tactics, a topic that has triggered mass protests, legal challenges and major political fallout in recent weeks.The clash also exemplifies how media figures like Kelly and Swisher act as influential voices in shaping public opinion and intensifying partisan narratives, often becoming part of the stories they comment on. As reactions continue, observers are likely to watch for further exchanges between media figures on both sides of the political divide, shifts in how commentators frame rhetorical boundaries, especially around controversial policies and figures and potential discussions within media venues about standards for analogies and comparisons, particularly those involving historical atrocities.","A sharp social media clash erupted this week between prominent American media figures over a controversial comparison made about former Trump adviser Stephen Miller.

The acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Madhu Gottumukkala, uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings, Politico reported.According to Department of Homeland Security officials, the cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August.One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to govt security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials. It is not clear what the review concluded.None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the officials. However, the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.The incident drew attention because Gottumukkala requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said.The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI.The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”Gottumukkala is currently the senior-most political official at CISA, an agency tasked with securing federal networks against sophisticated, state-backed hackers from adversarial nations, including Russia and China.Any material uploaded into the public version of ChatGPT that Gottumukkala was using is shared with ChatGPT-owner OpenAI, meaning it can be used to help answer prompts from other users of the app. OpenAI has said the app has more than 700 million total active users.Other AI tools now approved for use by DHS employees, such as DHS’s self-built AI-powered chatbot, DHSChat, are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks.Gottumukkala “forced CISA’s hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it,” said the first official.All federal officials are trained on the proper handling of sensitive documents. According to DHS policy, security officials are also supposed to investigate the “cause and affect” of any exposure of official use documents, and determine the “appropriateness” of any administrative or disciplinary action. Depending on the circumstances, those could range from mandatory retraining or a formal warning to more serious measures, such as the suspension or revocation of a security clearance, said one of the four officials.After DHS detected the activity, Gottumukkala spoke with senior officials at DHS to review what he uploaded into ChatGPT, said two of the four officials. DHS’s then-acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara, was involved in the effort to assess any potential harm to the department, according to the first official. Antoine McCord, DHS’s chief information officer, was also involved, according to a second official.Gottumukkala also had meetings this August with CISA’s chief information officer, Robert Costello, and its chief counsel, Spencer Fisher, about the incident and the proper handling of for official use only material, the four people said.Gottumukkala has led the agency in an acting capacity since May, when he was appointed by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as its deputy director. Donald Trump’s nominee to head CISA, DHS special adviser Sean Plankey, was blocked last year by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) over a Coast Guard shipbuilding contract. A date for his new confirmation hearing has not been set.Gottumukkala’s tenure atop the agency has not been smooth, and the ChatGPT incident was not his first security-related matter.At least six career staff were placed on leave this summer after Gottumukkala failed a counterintelligence polygraph exam that he pushed to take, as POLITICO first reported. DHS has called the polygraph “unsanctioned.” Asked during Congressional testimony last week if he was “aware” of the failed test, Gottumukkala twice told Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) that he did not “accept the premise of that characterization. ”Last week, Gottumukkala tried to oust Costello, CISA’s CIO, before other political appointees at the agency intervened to block the move.","Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer.

Email us your linkedin!”Musk hit back by saying his partner and son, too, are linked to India, to prove he is not exactly a White supremacist: “Vinod, you’re not just such a pompous a**hole that you tried to stop the public from using a public beach near your house, you’ve also gone full r***d. My partner, Shivon, is half Indian and my eldest son with her is named in honour of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”Musk’s partner, Shivon Alice Zilis, is a Canadian technology executive and venture capitalist. She was born to a Punjabi Indian mother and a Canadian father. Musk’s eldest son with Zilis carries a name paying tribute to Indian-American scientist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.Khosla later responded by urging Musk to avoid bringing his family into the dispute and to reconsider his public comments on race.He wrote: “Instead of bringing your family into it, maybe try not tweeting ‘SEEMINGLY’ racist stuff next time? Many would appreciate it if you acknowledge you are not trying to establish a white society in America, and are not WAGA, and racism isn’t behind your many laments around white birth rates, declining % of population and many similar laments. ""Khosla then addressed the personal jibe that Elon had launched at him: ""As to the beach issue you’d appreciate me standing up to the principle of defending ‘the principal of private property’ instead of giving in to whatever the Coastal Commission wants. EVERY court ruling (in Friends of Martin Beach case including all appeals) so far reaffirms there has NEVER been free access to the beach thru private property, just paid access for parking, though the beach is public property (I’ve never asserted it isn’t). You would appreciate it if you knew the facts. Anything else is communism. Separately, courts have denied my petition to have the right to close the gate because the CCC has not denied me the right to close the gate and wont give me a hearing for years because then they would have to deny my petition and I would have legal recourse. So they just wont give me a hearing date.""However, Khosla praised Musk at the end of his long reply: ""Unfortunately I have no proof to refute your claim that I am a pompous asshole and retarded. I have said publicly I do admire your extraordinary entrepreneurial skills.”The beach dispute refers to Khosla’s purchase of land near Martin’s Beach in Half Moon Bay, California, in 2008. He erected a gate on a road that had provided public access to the beach to block visitors. Legal battles followed, with a court ruling that Khosla must allow public access to the beach road. He faced backlash and people accused him of preventing the public from enjoying a shared space. But Khosla defended his actions as protecting private property rights.Khosla is an Indian-American billionaire entrepreneur born in Pune in 1955. He co-founded Sun Microsystems, spent 18 years at Kleiner Perkins, and later founded Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley investment firm focused on technology, biotech, energy, and AI. His net worth is over $9 billion.",Elon Musk and Vinod Khosla continue their social media spat after Musk had posted a comment about white people. Musk’s initial post said: “White people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population” KhosLA responded by accusing Musk of promoting a racial agenda in the US.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127731200,imgsize-1093506,width-400,resizemode-4/127731200.jpg"

A preliminary Department of Homeland Security report sent to Congress reveals that two federal officers fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on January 24, according to notices obtained by multiple news outlets.Both the agents were placed on administrative leave, according to DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. MS Now was first to report that detail, NBC news reported.The preliminary report, from a Customs and Border Protection internal investigation led by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was sent to congressional committees Tuesday, including the House Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, according to three sources.The DHS report said that during the encounter January 24, an officer yelled “He’s got a gun!” multiple times and then “approximately five seconds later a BPA [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO [Customs and Border Protection officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti.”It was unclear from the report whether the bullets from both officers’ guns hit Pretti.The report also did not make any mention of Pretti attacking officers or brandishing a gun, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed in the aftermath of the shooting.Multiple videos recorded by eyewitnesses that were verified and analysed by NBC News showed Pretti did not hold a weapon during the struggle as he was surrounded by agents. One video showed that a federal agent removed a gun from Pretti's waist area just before he was shot.The report said that after the shooting, a Border Patrol agent said he had possession of Pretti's gun, which was then secured in his vehicle.A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence"" Sunday, after state investigators were denied access to the crime scene.The report said its findings were based on CBP documents and body-camera from officers on the scene.It said that officers were ""conducting enforcement actions"" in Minneapolis on Saturday morning as part of Operation Metro Surge, near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 25th Street.The operation saw some 3,000 federal officers and agents deployed to Minnesota, while the Minneapolis Police Department had just 600 officers, as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on migrant communities and what federal officials said was an attempt to stamp out local corruption and fraud.The surge was met with strong local opposition and protests, particularly after a local woman, Renee Good, was shot dead by an immigration officer while at the wheel of her car January 7.""Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway,"" the report into Pretti's death said.An officer was then ""confronted"" by two women blowing whistles who failed to comply with an order to move out of the road, according to the report. After the officer pushed them both away, it said, one of them ran to a man the report identified as Pretti.The officer continued to attempt to move the woman and Pretti out of the road before using his pepper spray on them both, the report said.""CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel’s efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He’s got a gun!' multiple times,"" the report said.Approximately five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a CBP officer both fired shots at Pretti, according to the report.At 9:02 a.m., CBP staff cut Pretti's clothes and provided first aid including placing chest seals on his wounds, before fire department medics arrived two minutes later, the report said.He was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center at approximately 9:32 a.m.","Preliminary report sent to Congress reveals that two federal officers fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on January 24.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Is a wider terror alliance forming? Pakistan's Lashkar commander admits links to Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/is-a-wider-terror-alliance-forming-pakistans-lashkar-commander-admits-links-to-hamas/articleshow/127690725.cms,"(IANS photo)

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Pakistan’s former prime minister Imran Khan has been kept in solitary confinement and barred from meeting his lawyers or family for over three months, his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said on Monday.

Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

"Massive blaze at Karachi mall: Firefighter among six killed, many feared trapped",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/massive-blaze-at-karachi-mall-firefighter-among-six-killed-many-feared-trapped-video/articleshow/126643391.cms,"Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.
