"China, Russia concerned about India-US relationship: Top American diplomat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-russia-concerned-about-india-us-relationship-top-american-diplomat/articleshow/113409150.cms,"WASHINGTON: China and Russia are concerned about the strengthening India-US relationship because it promotes inclusivity, peace, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, along with valuing diverse voices in society, a top US diplomat said Monday.""Frankly, why do you think China and Russia are so concerned about this partnership? Because we bring a way of life to the rest of the world, that is about inclusivity, about peace, about the peaceful resolution of disputes, about the rule of law, and it's about hearing everyone's voice in a society,"" Richard Verma , the deputy secretary of state for management and resources said at the prestigious Hudson Institute, in response to a question, after he delivered remarks on India-US relationship.Verma said the relationship between India and US is ""a very different mode"" than how some of the adversaries of the latter operate.The diplomat noted that this uniqueness is why President Joe Biden has described the relationship between both countries as the ""defining relationship of this century"".He recalled that nearly 20 years ago, when he stood with then-Senator Biden and staff director Tony Blinken in the Senate, Biden had remarked that if the US and India were the closest friends and partners by 2020, the world would be a safer place.""Not just because we have two big militaries, not just because we have two big economies, but because we actually stand for something that matters to people in their daily lives across the world,"" Verma said.In response to a question on Quad , Verma said it aims to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity.""I look at what the Quad has, the kinds of statements and pronouncements it's made on technology, for example ...technology for good, not to harass, not to surveil, not to misinform, laying out a set of key principles, going even further on some of our work on quantum computing and cybersecurity,"" he said.""When I look at what the Quad has said and done on energy transition, trade, rule-based order, I don't think it has to take on a military character. Indians are not supportive of that. Frankly, I don't think we need that. I think there are other venues to deal with core military issues,"" he said.""I think this is about like-minded countries, two of which are treaty allies of the United States, coming together in a different form, in a different architecture, bringing in the most populous country in the Indo-Pacific to actually chart some new territory that we hadn't charted before,"" Verma said.""I think it has positive impact to security without being a treaty-based security organisation. There's great promise and excitement in the Quad. I think this weekend's meeting will be quite significant. It'll be historic. Quad will continue to just build in many ways,"" said the top American diplomat.US President Joe Biden will host the fourth in-person Quad leaders summit at his Delaware residence next week, in a rare gesture for his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan, a presidential spokesperson announced Thursday.India, which was scheduled to host Quad this year, would host the summit next year. Quad leadership summit is an initiative of Biden and is one of the key foreign policy legacies for the outgoing American president.","China and Russia are concerned about the strengthening India-US relationship because it promotes inclusivity, peace, and the peaceful resolution of disputes.

In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures. Several FIRs have been lodged in relation to the protests, and police injuries were reported during earlier confrontations in Shimla.","Hindu groups demand action against alleged illegal construction in Shimla.

It was not clear whether the new leader of the legislative party will accompany Kejriwal or stake claim later.Once the CM resigns, the entire cabinet will have to follow suit.The new leader of the legislative party will pick a new council of ministers who will take oath of office. Majority will then have to be proved on the floor of the House. ""The entire process may take a week,"" said a senior party functionary.This turn of events was prompted by Kejriwal's unexpected announcement Sunday that he would resign. Addressing party workers, he said he would not occupy the CM's chair unless the people gave him a ""certificate of honesty"". He had also mentioned that another member of the party would take over as CM.Kejriwal's move may have been prompted by the curbs imposed on him by Supreme Court while granting him bail. SC has barred him from signing files other than the ones needed for LG's approval, and also prohibited him from visiting the Secretariat. Effectively, this confines him to his official residence and could hamper his functioning.Playing the ""honesty"" card by asking people to vote for the party only if they considered him honest, Kejriwal has set the campaign theme for the elections. That he called for early polls, along with Maharashtra in Nov, but not sought dissolution of assembly has sent the signal that AAP will carry out a long-drawn campaign. Election Commission sources have anyway indicated that early polls are not possible as electoral rolls are being revised.","All eyes are now on the meeting of the AAP legislative party at 11.30am on Tuesday.

Historic rainfall triggers severe flooding in North Carolina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/historic-rainfall-triggers-severe-flooding-in-coastal-north-carolina/articleshow/113407806.cms,"'There’s water inside the building...'

Floodwaters caused significant disruptions in coastal North Carolina on Monday, following a powerful storm system that unleashed historic rainfall within just a few hours. The heavy rains led to extensive flooding , submerging homes, stranding vehicles, and requiring numerous water rescues.According to town manager Bruce Oakley, Carolina Beach was heavily impacted by the rainfall.“It’s likely the worst flooding we’ve ever seen in Carolina Beach,” he told CNN. “We’ve had to rescue individuals from both vehicles and buildings, including houses and businesses.”Carolina Beach was declared a state of emergency after the National Weather Service in Wilmington recorded a historic 18 inches of rain in just 12 hours at one location, marking a once-in-1,000-year event. Other areas in the region received over a foot of rain within 12 hours, a once-in-200-year event.Oakley noted that emergency services were busy responding to numerous rescue calls.The storm, identified as Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight , was not organized enough to be classified as a tropical or subtropical storm. It is expected to subside by early Wednesday.Due to the flooding, Carolina Beach Elementary School closed early. Law enforcement and fire crews assisted in transporting children home as routes were blocked by up to 3 feet of water.Brunswick County also encountered heavy rain, with rates exceeding 4 to 5 inches per hour. In just three hours, Sunny Point received over 9 inches of rain. “Our deputies are assisting multiple individuals who are stranded in their cars and homes,” the Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. Southport city officials issued a shelter-in-place order and a nighttime curfew.By Monday evening, conditions in Carolina Beach improved, and tropical storm warnings for the coastal Carolinas were lifted. However, many abandoned vehicles remained on the roads, according to town mayor Lynn Barbee.North Carolina remained under a flood watch until Tuesday despite the system weakening. The National Weather Service warned that “excessive runoff could result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone areas.”Forecasters predict that the system will continue to weaken over the next day or so, with the low expected to dissipate over the Carolinas by early Wednesday. They also noted that while less than an inch of additional rainfall is expected Monday night, there is only a 20% chance of rain on Tuesday.Michael McLaughlin , the owner of The Fat Pelican, shared his challenges with the flooding, as quoted by CNN: “There’s water inside the building. I’m trying to recover items that floated away.” Despite the damage, McLaughlin remained hopeful about getting the business back up and running.Lisa and Gary Hollon, who have owned a home in Kure Beach for nearly 15 years, experienced flooding for the first time. “We were caught off guard and had never flooded before,” Lisa Hollon said, adding that their home’s first floor was suddenly covered with 4 to 6 inches of water.In Supply, North Carolina, Timothy Turner used his surfboard to help neighbors navigate the floodwaters. Turner described rescuing a neighbor’s dog using his board. “I’ve performed 25 rescues from rip currents over the last eight years, but this was the first time I used a surfboard for a dog rescue,” he said, according to CNN.Earlier in August, Tropical Storm Debby had already drenched the Carolinas with 6 to 12 inches of rain, resulting in flash floods near Charleston, South Carolina.","Floodwaters caused significant disruptions in coastal North Carolina on Monday. Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight unleashed historic rainfall within just a few hours. The heavy rains led to extensive flooding, submerging homes, stranding vehicles, and requiring numerous water rescues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113409271,imgsize-1276116,width-400,resizemode-4/113409271.jpg"

But it will take another week to gauge the complete impact of any post-debate bounce. The second assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday will act as an unpredictable element with the focus going away from the debate,According to NYT's polling average, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump by three percentage points nationwide.""The contest is even tighter in the critical battleground states, where no candidate leads by even a single percentage point in enough states to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency,"" the NYT report said.The current leader in the poll average in five of the seven swing states — Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona — is ahead by just one point or less.According to NYT average, Kamala Harris gained about one point nationwide rising from a 1.7-point lead on Wednesday morning to a 2.7-point lead as of Monday morning. This is being attributed to the debate gains though Donald Trump claimed he won the debate.The gains for Kamala Harris might be more as most of the post-debate polls have come from online panels. They tend to shift less than other polls, as they poll highly engaged voters. Also, many people do not watch the debate on the television but they hear the post-debate coverage.

Drugged and raped for a decade, woman becomes symbol of courage and resilience",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-gisele-pelicot-drugged-and-raped-for-a-decade-woman-becomes-symbol-of-courage-and-resilience/articleshow/113383469.cms,"Who is Gisele Pelicot?

Gisele Pelicot case explained

What is going on in court?

Hundreds of people, mostly women, came out in the street in support of Gisele Pelicot, a woman who was allegedly drugged by her ex-husband (who was her husband at that time) for a decade and he recruited dozens of strangers to rape her which has shocked the nation.The feminist associations have called for some 30 gatherings on Saturday in cities ranging from Marseille to Paris, where on the Place de la Republique banners read “Support to Gisele” or “Shame Must Change Camp” or “Victims We believe you”.Pelicot has become France ’s symbol of the fight against sexual violence , AP New reported.A 72-year-old woman caught the attention of headlines when she filed a case against her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot of repeatedly raping her and enlisting strangers to abuse his heavily sedated wife in the couple’s home over the course of a decade.Since the beginning of the case Pelicot has to go through a rough path. She chose to go for a public trial to alert the public to sexual abuse and drug-induced blackouts.During this trial, she had to face 51 of her alleged rapists which is due to run until December. People are praised for her courage and composure.She also allowed journalists to use her full name in their articles or the other platforms and even gave a nod to the court to exhibit explicit videos recorded by her husband showing men engaging in sexual intercourse with her naked, inert body.Her bold and courageous behaviour is praised by the entire France nation and even foreign countries.In an open letter translated into English and published in the French newspaper Le Monde, journalist and author Helene Devynck thanked Pelicot for her bravery, echoing the feelings of many other French people.“You entered our lives like you entered the Avignon court, through the front door,” wrote Devynck, a figure of the French #MeToo movement. “It’s not just you, Gisele, that they’ve treated like a thing. They were telling us, all of us women, how insignificant we are. Your strength restores ours. Thank you for this immense gift.”According to the police, the abuse began in 2011 when the couple lived near Paris and continued after their move to Mazan. Dominique routinely drugged his wife and invited strangers to join him in assaulting her, often filming the encounters. Pelicot has no memory of the attacks but will see many of them played in court as dozens of defendants go on trial in Avignon, France, between now and December. The revelation of his abuse has destroyed a formerly tight-knit family, and the reason behind his actions remains unclear.Pelicot came to know about this horrifying act through the police who gave her the information.Dominique’s crimes came to light in 2020 when he was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities uncovered the scale of the abuse. He and 50 other men are now on trial for aggravated rape, with the proceedings expected to last four months. The victims of these attacks included various individuals, from a fire brigade officer to a journalist, and while most participated only once, some returned multiple times.Pelicot will face the man with whom she shared her life for over 50 years and the father of their three children on Monday. Her lawyer has said she is planning on attending his testimony.Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, for health reasons, has been exempted from attending the trial since last week. He is expected to testify on Monday or Tuesday, his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, has said.Dominique has previously confessed to the crimes to investigators, but his court hearing will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of the 50 other men accused of rape, reported AP news agency.Some defendants have claimed they believed a husband's consent for sexual intercourse was sufficient, while others said they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot into believing his wife was consenting.One lawyer representing six defendants has shocked the nation by arguing that ""there is rape and rape, and without intention, there is no rape.""","Gisele Pelicot, 72, has been accused of repeatedly raping her ex-husband Dominique.

The man did not fire at Trump, who was about 500 yards away golfing with a friend.Soon after the incident, Trump assured his followers that he was safe and well. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” he posted on his platform ""Truth Social.""He later thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement for keeping him safe on what he called “an interesting day."" One lawmaker who spoke to Trump after the incident said he had joked about not being able to complete his round of gold.In an oblique reference to an earlier assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania, Trump later wrote, ""When you’re “hot” the lowlifes really shoot at you... and they try hitting from every angle! Never let the bastards get you down.""In separate statements, President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris expressed relief that Trump was unharmed and said the was no place for political violence in the country, as activists on both sides accused the other of engendering the atmosphere conducive to such violence.Social media posts matching Routh's name showed him strongly supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, and urging the US Congress to allow Americans to fight in the conflict.He had also been in the public eye a few times after encounters with the media and law enforcement. In an NYT interview in 2023, he said he was trying to recruit Afghan solders who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. He had also been arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, North Carolina, after barricading himself inside a building with an automatic weapon.Tracked down by a tabloid, his estranged son Oran Routh told the Daily Mail that his father was a ""great dad"" and a ""nice guy"" and he hates Trump -- like “all reasonable people.”Although Trump praised the Secret Service and law enforcement for acting quickly to protect him, questions raged about how a potential assassin managed to get so close to the former president again.“There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened in Florida,” Republican lawmaker Elise Stefanik said in a statement.""Two assassination attempts in 60 days on a former President & the Republican nominee is unacceptable.

Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was taken into custody in New York City on Monday night as part of a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations. Although specific details of the charges have not been released, Combs’ legal team, led by Marc Agnifilo, has expressed disappointment in what they call an “unjust prosecution.”The arrest comes after a series of high-profile raids by Homeland Security Investigations agents on March 25.These raids targeted Combs’ properties in Los Angeles and Miami, raising questions about the nature of the federal investigation.Over the past year, Combs has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and assault. The most recent lawsuit, filed on February 27, 2024, by producer Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones, claims that Combs sexually assaulted him repeatedly during the production of his album,. Jones alleges that Combs groped him without consent and attempted to coerce him into a homosexual relationship, asserting that Combs also owes him $50,000 for his work on the album.Earlier, on November 16, 2023, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend, filed a federal lawsuit accusing him of years of abuse, including rape, physical violence, and coercion into sexual acts with male escorts. The suit also alleged that Combs had destroyed Kid Cudi’s car to prevent him from seeing Cassie romantically. Combs has denied these claims, asserting that Cassie attempted to blackmail him for $30 million. The case was settled the following day, though Combs' attorney said that the settlement did not imply any admission of guilt.Five days after settling with Cassie, another lawsuit emerged from a former Syracuse University student who accused Combs of drugging, raping, and recording her in 1991. This lawsuit also claims that Combs showed the footage to others. Combs’ representatives have dismissed this as a “money grab.”Additionally, on November 23, 2023, an anonymous accuser filed a lawsuit under New York’s Adult Survivors Act, alleging that Combs and singer Aaron Hall raped her and a friend in the early 1990s, with Combs later assaulting her again.","Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was taken into custody in New York City on Monday night as part of a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations.

Agents sometimes warn people from getting too close to Trump, but the ex-prez has usually embraced a laid-back atmosphere, inviting people to pose for pictures or talk with him.

Donald Trump Assassination: US Presidential Election 2024 Top 10; ‘Florida Man’ tries to assassinate Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-2024-top-10-florida-man-tries-to-assassinate-trump/articleshow/113400975.cms,"Florida Man Grabs Pistol After Chicken Wings Take Over an Hour Florida Man Bites Head Off Animal During Domestic Dispute Florida Man Loses Arm to Alligator After Using Pond as a Bathroom Florida Man Shuts Down Roadway for 10 Hours While Throwing Meth and Exposing His Genitals Florida Man Ticketed for Driving “Booty Patrol” Truck Resembling a Border Patrol Vehicle

Hello and welcome back to US Presidential Election Top 10 – your daily guide to the American election season.The term "" Florida Man "" is a popular internet meme based on the notion that the state is home to people prone to irrational or outrageous behaviour. A CNN article on the meme suggested that the large number of bizarre incidents in Florida can be attributed to several factors: public records laws that allow journalists easy access to police reports, the state’s sizeable population, its wildly unpredictable weather, and, frankly, inadequate mental health funding.Here are a few recent examples:In fact, there’s even an internet game called the Florida Man Birthday Challenge, where you type your birthday followed by ""Florida Man"" to discover the wild adventure of a Florida resident on that day.Going forward, 15th September will read: “Florida Man tries to assassinate Donald Trump.”Of course, some pedants might point out that ""Florida Man"" doesn’t apply here, as Ryan Routh was most recently in Hawaii and spent much of his life in North Carolina, but you know what they say about Rome...While assassination attempts on US Presidents (and presidential candidates) are very much part of the nation’s history, a second attempt during a single election cycle is quite rare. This second attempt on Trump took place in his natural habitat – the golf course – where a man named Ryan Routh, armed with an AK-47 rifle, managed to get within 300-500 yards of where Trump was golfing.The last time Trump was shot at, it became an iconic image, after which Trump, in his usual humble style, boasted: “A lot of people say it’s the most iconic photo they’ve ever seen. They’re right, and I didn’t die. Usually, you have to die to have an iconic picture.”This time, he joked with his doctor that he was glad he “didn’t need his services today” and told Sean Hannity of Fox News that he was “disappointed not to be able to finish his putt,” noting that he was “even and had a birdie putt.”Interestingly, Routh has been in the news before. In 2023, he appeared in a New York Times profile about Americans who had travelled to Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion. He claimed to have tried to recruit Afghan soldiers – who had fled the Taliban – to fight against Russia, and his social media profile makes it hard to pinpoint his exact political ideology.In 2016, he voted for Trump before becoming infuriated with him. By 2020, Routh was quite infatuated with Tulsi Gabbard , and more recently appeared to support a Ramaswamy-Haley Republican ticket. He wrote on X (formerly Twitter) when Ramaswamy dropped out: “You cannot quit. Why? You must stay on the ballot until the end. You must fight. You must keep giving speeches and push all the way to Election Day, no matter the results. Do not give in. Join Nikki and keep working. Never give up.”The first assassination attempt on Trump prompted the Democratic establishment to pull the plug on Joe Biden’s presidency.To be fair, we’re in completely uncharted waters here, with a second assassination attempt on a presidential nominee during one election cycle. America’s current broken kulturkampf makes it difficult to predict the outcome, especially as MAGA has fundamentally transformed the Republican Party. What was once a party of fiscal conservatism, respect for institutions, and commitment to free markets has shifted to a personality-driven populist movement centred around Trump. This shift has alienated many traditional Republicans, created deep internal divisions, and left the GOP grappling with an identity crisis. Before the assassination attempt, the Republican Party 's major attack was based on the false rumour that Haitians were eating cats in Springfield, Ohio.Here are the ten big developments for the day:","""Florida Man"" is a popular internet meme based on the notion that the state is home to people prone to irrational or outrageous behaviour.

Militants in Pakistan used PUBG features to attack police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/militants-in-pakistan-used-pubg-features-to-attack-police-station/articleshow/113390618.cms,"Militants in Swat , Pakistan, utilized features from the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) to plan and execute an attack on a local police station, reported Dawn.Militants targeted the Banr police station in Swat on August 28, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to two others. In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

Pakistan stand-off over cops seeking army exit from restive province drags on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-stand-off-over-cops-seeking-army-exit-from-restive-province-drags-on/articleshow/113302897.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The stand-off in northwestern Pakistan involving police units that have gone on strike to demand the withdrawal of military and intelligence agencies from the restive region entered the fourth day Thursday with no sign of the crisis easing.On Sept 9, hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi, in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to protest alleged military interference in their regular duties.Police officers from the surrounding districts, including Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, joined their protesting colleagues, while political parties, tribal leaders and civil society groups expressed solidarity with them.The protesters, who accuse the ISI and Military Intelligence of exacerbating the situation in the region, have seen many of their colleagues kidnapped or ambushed by Taliban fighters and supporters in Lakki Marwat, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan over the last few years. In some cases, their houses and families have been targeted.This is the first instance in Pakistan of uniformed personnel on a sit-in and blocking an inter-provincial highway for four consecutive days. The protesters have so far turned down requests by their bosses to hold talks and end the agitation.Officer Rashid Khan said the army should leave the district and let the police department work freely.“We promise to restore peace in the area within three months if military officers stop their interference,"" he said in Lakki Marwat.""Their game of playing good and bad Taliban is not over. We (police force) arrest militants and they (the military) call us to release them,"" another official at the sit-in told TOI.The army has a large presence in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, where it has been battling the Taliban and other outfits for nearly two decades.Police officials in Bajaur tribal district, bordering Afghanistan, have announced they wouldn't work even with anti-polio teams until the administration identified and arrested the killers of a colleague who was shot dead while escorting once such group in Bajaur this week.“There will be a complete boycott of polio duty,” a video circulating on social media showed a man standing among a group of uniformed personnel as saying. ""They (the government and security officials) will give us the killers of Luqman (the police constable killed in the latest attack while performing polio duty) first.""Pakistan has seen a rise in militant attacks in recent weeks, with many of them taking place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where groups like the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, have stepped up attacks, targeting security forces convoys and checkpoints, and carrying out targeted killings and kidnappings of security personnel and govt officials.At least 75 police personnel have been killed in ambushes and targeted killings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year, according to official data.","Hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi.

Gunmen kill a policeman guarding polio workers in northwestern Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gunmen-kill-a-policeman-guarding-polio-workers-in-northwestern-pakistan/articleshow/113301216.cms,"PESHAWAR: A pair of gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on Thursday and killed a policeman guarding a group of polio workers going door-to-door in a vaccination campaign in northwestern Pakistan , police said, the second attack on the country's anti-polio campaign in as many days.The latest attack took place in Bannu, a district in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to police officer Nasrullah Khan.The policeman who was gunned down was standing on a street corner and the attackers fled the scene, Khan said.In a similar attack Wednesday in Bajur, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a group of gunmen on motorcycles killed two people, a polio worker and a police escort.No one has so far claimed responsibility for the two attacks, which have spread fears among the polio workers. Authorities on Monday launched a new, nationwide polio vaccination campaign amid stepped-up security to protect the polio workers.On Monday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying officers assigned to protect polio workers in the district of South Waziristan, also in the same province, wounding six officers and three civilians. The militant Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for Monday's attack.Anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Since January, Pakistan has reported 17 new cases of polio, jeopardizing decades of efforts to eliminate polio in the country.The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under age 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in which the spread of polio has never been stopped.","Gunmen on a motorcycle kill a policeman guarding a group of polio workers.
