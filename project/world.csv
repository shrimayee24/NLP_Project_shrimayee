He was initially picked up in Abu Dhabi in Nov 2023 based on the NBW issued by an NIA court, and the subsequent red corner notice by Interpol. On Friday, an NIA team brought him to Delhi from Abu Dhabi following his extradition in line with Interpol’s due processes.Tarsem is an important terror node of designated terrorists Rinda and Landa in UAE , officials said. Among other cases, he was wanted in the RPG attack on Punjab Police in Mohali in May 2022.Tarsem was involved in arranging and providing terror funds to India-based associates of Rinda and Landa. It is alleged that he also helped in channeling terror funds through multiple routes.NIA had booked him on Aug 20, 2022, in connection with terror activities of chiefs/members of proscribed terrorist organisations, such as Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), BKI and International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), among others, who have established a large network of terror operators across India.“These outfits are working through operatives/members of terror outfits and organised criminal gangs to smuggle arms, ammunition, explosives, IEDs from across the border,” an official said. “They have been using narcotics trafficking, extortions, hawala trading to generate funds for carrying out terrorist activities on Indian soil, NIA investigations so far have revealed,” he added.",Tarsem is a key aide of foreign-based pro-Khalistan terrorists Harwinder Sandhu alias Rinda and Lakhbir Singh alias Landa.

'Will you ban girls wearing bindi or tilak?' SC on hijab ban imposed by Mumbai college,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-you-ban-girls-wearing-bindi-or-tilak-sc-stays-hijab-ban-imposed-by-mumbai-college/articleshow/112399456.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday partly stayed the enforcement of a hijab ban at a Mumbai college until November 18.""Will you ban girls wearing bindi or tilak,"" the bench asked, while staying the circular banning wearing of hijab, no cap, or badge on campus. ""Girl students must have freedom of choice in what they are wearing and college cannot force them...It's unfortunate that you suddenly wake up to know that there are many religions in the country,"" the bench told the college administration.The college contended that allowing Muslim female students to wear hijabs could lead to Hindu students wearing saffron shawls, as political elements might exploit the situation.The top court said its interim order on 'burqa, hijab' should not be misused and granted liberty to Mumbai college to approach the court in case of misuse.Furthermore, the apex court ruled that girls cannot wear burqas inside classrooms and that religious activities are not allowed on campus.The Supreme Court was hearing a plea challenging a Bombay high court verdict upholding a Mumbai college's decision to ban hijabs, burqas and naqabs inside the campus.The petitioners sought an urgent hearing due to upcoming unit tests. On June 26, the high court refused to interfere with the college's decision, stating that such rules do not infringe upon students' fundamental rights and that a dress code is intended to maintain discipline, which is part of the college's fundamental right to establish and administer an educational institution.On October 13, 2022, a two-judge bench of the apex court delivered opposing verdicts in the hijab controversy emanating from Karnataka. The then BJP-led state government had imposed a ban on wearing the Islamic head covering in schools there.The Bombay high court dismissed the plea against the ban, stating that the dress code applied to all students regardless of religion or caste.The students, who were in their second and third years of a science degree program, had approached the high court, arguing that the college's directive imposing a dress code violated their fundamental right to practice religion, right to privacy, and right to choice. They claimed that the college's action was ""arbitrary, unreasonable, bad-in-law and perverse.""","The top court said its interim order on 'burqa, hijab' should not be misused.

69 Indians await release from Russian army: Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/69-indians-await-release-from-russian-army-jaishankar/articleshow/112413810.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Friday said the govt is awaiting release of 69 Indians recruited into Russian army and that in many cases there are indications that the Indian nationals were misled into joining that country’s armed forces. So far, Jaishankar said there are 91 Indian nationals recruited into Russian army. Out of them, eight have passed away, 14 were discharged or in some manner have come back with govt’s assistance and “there are 69 citizens awaiting release from Russian army,” he said, in response to a question in LS.Out of the eight who died, the mortal remains of four have been sent back to India and in two cases — one from Haryana and Punjab — DNA samples have been sent to the Russian side.In one case from Gujarat, the family wants the body to be cremated in Russia and in another case from UP, the mortal remains are being brought back, Jaishankar said while responding to a Parliament question in the Lok Sabha.According to the EAM, the issue is that Russian authorities maintain these Indian entered contracts for services with Russian army. “We are not necessarily subscribing to that... In many cases there are reasons to indicate that our nationals were misled, that they were told that they were going for some other job and then they were deployed with the Russian army,” he added.The issue of Indians recruited into Russian army was taken up by PM Modi during his meeting with Russian president Putin last month. “We take this issue very very seriously. I have myself raised it numerous times with the Russian foreign minister...When the Prime Minister was in Moscow last month, he raised it personally with President Putin and got the assurance that any Indian national in the service of the Russian army will be discharged and released,” Jaishankar said.","S Jaishankar said there are 91 Indian nationals recruited into Russian army.

They did not disclose the location or more specifics.Biden and Harris have appeared briefly together since the president ended his reelection bid on July 21, including an excursion to Joint Base Andrews last week to welcome home U.S. citizens who were wrongfully detained in Russia. They also participated in a Situation Room meeting together earlier this week to discuss the situation in the Middle East and had lunch together last week.Taking additional steps to lower costs is one area Biden wants to focus on in the final months of his presidency. In repeated calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients shortly after ending his reelection campaign, Biden stressed that he wanted to continue work on reducing health care and housing costs and implementing his landmark bills such as the infrastructure law, while highlighting the importance of protecting U.S. democracy.Executing his day job remains Biden's chief priority, aides and advisers have said.""His intention is to focus on the American people, to ... continuing to deliver and build on the unprecedented successes - historic, historic successes - that he has had in the last three and a half years with the vice president,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this week. ""That's his focus.""But his political aides are sketching out how the outgoing president can be helpful on the campaign trail for Harris. There will be a joint political event with Biden and Harris, although the timing, location or other details have yet to be determined, according to an adviser for the president. Biden also plans to headline fundraisers for Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said the adviser, who was granted anonymity to discuss the president's plans that are not yet public.Biden also wants to do whatever else is helpful - may it be calls to allies or meeting with key groups - to ensure that the coalition of voters who turned out for him in 2020 will do so again with Harris at the top of the ticket this fall, the adviser said. Before he dropped out of the race, Biden's campaign had largely narrowed its focus to retaining the so-called ""blue wall"" of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and that region may be where he would be the biggest asset politically on behalf of Harris.","The White House announced Friday that Biden and Harris will head to Maryland on Aug. 15 for an official, non-campaign event.

Often called ""tidal waves,"" tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history. In contrast to ordinary ocean waves, tsunamis are caused by abrupt, large-scale events in or close to a body of water, such landslides, undersea earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. These disturbances produce waves that move across oceans with enormous force and speed, becoming taller as they get closer to shallow coastal regions.The sheer force of tsunamis has the potential to completely destroy infrastructure, wreak havoc on coastal populations, and result in a high death toll. Because of their unparalleled devastation, several tsunamis have left enduring impressions on history over the ages. Here are the top 10 deadliest tsunamis ever recorded in human history.The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, hit Japan with a magnitude of 9.0. This tsunami caused catastrophic damage to Japan's northeastern coast and led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The tsunami caused extensive economic damage and nuclear fallout.On December 26, 2004, one of the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history struck the Indian Ocean. Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1-9.3, it affected countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, and several others. The tsunami resulted in entire communities being washed away.On December 26, 2003, a tsunami struck the coast of Iran following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake near Bam. The tsunami, combined with the earthquake's impact, led to the destruction of Bam and surrounding areas.The Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, occurred on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the strongest ever recorded. The tsunami affected Chile and spread across the Pacific Ocean, causing deaths in places as far away as Hawaii and Japan.On November 4, 1952, an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. The resulting tsunami affected the Pacific Ocean, reaching as far as Hawaii and causing significant damage in the region.On December 28, 1908, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck the Strait of Messina between Sicily and mainland Italy. The resulting tsunami caused massive destruction in Messina and Reggio Calabria, killing an estimated 123,000 people. This event remains one of the deadliest tsunamis in European history.A magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan’s Sanriku region on June 15, 1896, triggering a massive tsunami. The waves hit the Japanese coast with enormous force, causing widespread destruction and killing many people. This event is often remembered for its sheer scale and impact on the local population.On August 13, 1868, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5 struck off the coast of Peru. The resulting tsunami devastated coastal towns in Peru and Chile, particularly Arica (now in Chile). The waves were reported to have reached as far away as Hawaii.Following the earthquake of March 5, 1783, in Southern Italy, a tsunami struck the coast of Calabria. The earthquake, with a magnitude of around 7.9, triggered a tsunami that resulted in significant destruction and loss of life, with estimates of up to 50,000 deaths in the affected regions.Following the Lisbon earthquake on November 1, 1755, a devastating tsunami hit Portugal and its colonies. With an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, the tsunami ravaged Lisbon and other Portuguese coastal cities, resulting in approximately 10,000-100,000 deaths","Tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history. They are caused by abrupt, large-scale events in or close to a body of water. The sheer force of tsunamis has the potential to destroy infrastructure, wreak havoc on coastal populations, and result in a high death toll.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112410392,imgsize-127424,width-400,resizemode-4/112410392.jpg"
Singer Rahul Ananda backed protest but his house too torched,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/singer-rahul-ananda-backed-protest-but-his-house-too-torched/articleshow/112356766.cms,"KOLKATA: Renowned Bangladeshi folk singer Rahul Ananda ’s 140-year-old rented home in Dhaka ’s Dhanmondi 32 was targeted Monday by a mob of armed men, which broke down the main gate, ransacked and looted the house, and set it on fire, destroying more than 3,000 handcrafted musical instruments . The attack prompted the singer (48) and his family to go into hiding.The single-storey, colonial-style house where the frontman of the popular folk band “Joler Gaan” lived with his wife and son for over a decade was one of the stops on French President Emmanuel Macron ’s Bangladesh itinerary during his visit to Dhaka in Sept 2023.The Daily Star quoted one of the band’s founding members Saiful Islam Jarnal, who described how the mob took whatever they could find — furniture, mirrors, and other valuables — before torching the house along with Ananda’s collection of musical instruments.Videos and pictures of the attack have circulated online, eliciting widespread condemnation and regret over the destruction.Bangladeshis, many of whom participated in the protests that led to the ousting of PM Sheikh Hasina , denounced Wednesday the act of vandalism, stressing that such mindless destruction tarnishes the country’s image.“I am ashamed. This was not what our students laid their lives for. The Bangladesh I know is very different from what I have been witnessing the past 72 hours. Tolerance is the key here. The students have already appealed for peace,” Dhaka University professor Rafikul Hassan said.Last Saturday, musicians in Bangladesh held a congregation at Dhanmondi to show solidarity with protesting students.“Rahul-da and several other musicians arrived after 3pm and assembled at Rabindra Sarobar… It’s difficult to say if the attack on the house was targeted, but it is evident people disrespectful of art and culture were active. As part of the movement, I denounce this plundering and bloodshed. This portrays an exceedingly negative image of our nation, and we do not desire that,” said music researcher and cultural activist Gowtam K Shubho, administrator of Shonar Bangla Circus.Actor Azmeri Haque Badhon criticised the groups disrupting the secular fabric of the nation. “This is an exceedingly abhorrent crime. I am convinced that some agenda-driven individuals are trying to solely perpetuate the conflict,” he said.Dhaka-based writer Jobaed Ahsan expressed hope for a changed situation with the formation of an interim govt.“This kind of reaction is inevitable in any transition, especially when the public has faced such oppression for 15 years. Some miscreants will take advantage,” he said.","Rahul Ananda’s 140-year-old rented home in Dhaka ’s Dhanmondi 32 was targeted Monday.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.

""I am just one of many colleagues who benefited greatly from her experience, and from her unwaveringly championing advancement and higher pay for women in publishing .""Born Betty Arnoff in New York City and a graduate of Vassar College, Prashker was a longtime bookworm, storyteller and tennis player whose life and career mirrored those of many women after World War II. She started out as a reader-receptionist at Doubleday in 1945, married labor lawyer Herbert Prashker in 1950 (they divorced in 1974) and took off the next decade to raise their three children. With the help of the emerging feminist movement of the 1960s, she returned to work and became an associate publisher. She had initially been turned down by Doubleday, in the early 1960s, but a few years later was unexpectedly asked to lunch by Editor-in Chief Ken McCormick.""Doubleday doesn't have enough women in top jobs,"" Prashker remembered him telling her, as quoted in Al Silverman's ""The Time of Their Lives,"" a publishing history. ""And if we want to continue to do business with the government, we have got to do something in the way of affirmative action and have more women in our group.""Back in the 1940s, Prashker had failed to convince Doubleday to take on a promising young writer she had met at a Greenwich Village party, James Baldwin. Now, her judgment was welcomed. In the late 1960s, she learned of a Columbia University graduate student writing a Ph.D dissertation on how women were depicted in Western literature. Prashker signed up the student, Millett, and published what became ""Sexual Politics,"" a cornerstone of second-wave feminism that Prashker would call an ""educational experience for a dilettante like me.""Over the following decades she would publish hundreds of books, including such hits as Larson's ""The Devil in the White City,"" Auel's ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" series and Dunne's ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles."" In the early 1990s, when she was editor-in-chief at Crown, she acquired a book on the anti-feminist wave of the previous decade that several other publishers had rejected, Faludi's ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women.""""My determined and devoted agent tried everything, including pitching the book as 'a female ""In Search of Excellence""' (a long-running bestseller then) - with both of us praying no one would ask what that meant,"" Faludi wrote on medium.com in 2014. ""In the end, the one person who was interested was Betty Prashker, editor-in-chief at Crown Publishers and, not coincidentally, a feminist pioneer.""Not long after releasing ""Backlash,"" Prashker signed up an author whose first book had sold poorly and who was seeking a new publisher: Erik Larson had been working on an exploration of guns in the US, ""Lethal Passage,"" which Crown published in 1994.""I first met with Betty in her office and after a while she started to get up and said 'I have another meeting now,' and I thought, 'That's it for me,' "" Larson told The Associated Press during a telephone interview Friday. ""But it turned out the meeting was for me. She leads me into a conference room and there all these people primed to work on the book - marketing, editorial, publicity, the whole deal. It was a terrific experience.""Prashker remained as an executive at Crown until the late 1990s, when she stepped back and became an editor at large, continuing to work with Larson, among others. In 1998, her name entered film history when director Whit Stillman, who had previously worked at Doubleday, called one of the characters Justine Prashker in ""The Last Days of Disco.""She had earlier become part of legal history. In the 1970s, she noticed that many of her peers would take authors to the all-male Century Club, an elite gathering space in midtown Manhattan founded in the 19th century by James Fenimore Cooper and William Cullen Bryant, among others. Despite being sponsored by William F. Buckley among others, she was initially turned away, because, she was told, the club ″exists at the pleasure and for the pleasure of the gentlemen who constitute its membership"" and that her request was ""moot.""But the Century Club was later found in violation of local anti-discriminatory law and reversed its position, in the mid-1980s. Prashker didn't bother to reapply.""It was the Groucho Marx idea,"" she would explain for an oral history project at Random House, referring to Groucho's famous quip that he wouldn't want to join a club that had him as a member. ""The important thing to do was to desegregate the place.""","Betty Prashker was one of the first women with the power to acquire books. She published classics such as Kate Millett's "" Sexual Politics"" and Susan Faludi's ""Backlash"" She oversaw the careers of Jean Auel, Dominick Dunne and Erik Larson.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112416787,imgsize-1008224,width-400,resizemode-4/112416787.jpg"

"Trump plane heading to Montana rally was diverted but landed safely nearby, airport staff says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-plane-heading-to-montana-rally-was-diverted-but-landed-safely-nearby-airport-staff-says/articleshow/112413421.cms,"Former President Donald Trump headed to Montana for a Friday night rally in hopes of ousting the state's Democratic senator , but his plane first had to divert to an airport on the other side of the Rocky Mountains because of a mechanical issue, according to airport staff.Trump's plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport.Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet.Trump’s campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing.The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester .Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy , trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She's drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee.Trump's only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.""“I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.”He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado.Trump could be decisive in Montana's Senate raceFriday's rally at Montana State University , which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president's bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy's on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin.“There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,"" Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business.Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s.Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He's also become a prolific fundraiser.The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents.For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator.Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson's nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs DepartmentThen-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points.Tester has positioned himself apart from national DemocratsBefore Trump's latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he's part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans' issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed.Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party's presidential candidate in the wake of Biden's withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said.The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points.A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump.Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown's 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law.Friday's rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career.He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale.Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year.Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines.“Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.”But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California.Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves.","Trump's plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east.

"Man who attacked police at the US Capitol with poles gets 20 years, one of longest January 6 sentences",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-who-attacked-police-at-the-us-capitol-with-poles-gets-20-years-one-of-longest-january-6-sentences/articleshow/112412194.cms,"WASHINGTON: A California man with a history of political violence was sentenced on Friday to 20 years in prison for repeatedly attacking police with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons during the Jan. 6 , 2021, riot at the US Capitol.David Nicholas Dempsey 's sentence is among the longest among hundreds of Capitol riot prosecutions. Prosecutors described him as one of the most violent members of the mob of Donald Trump supporters that attacked the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.Dempsey, who is from Van Nuys, stomped on police officers' heads. He swung poles at officers defending a tunnel, struck an officer in the head with a metal crutch and attacked police with pepper spray and broken pieces of furniture, prosecutors said.He climbed atop other rioters, using them like ""human scaffolding"" to reach officers guarding a tunnel entrance. He injured at least two police officers, prosecutors said.""Your conduct on January 6th was exceptionally egregious,"" US District Judge Royce Lamberth told Dempsey. ""You did not get carried away in the moment.""Dempsey pleaded guilty in January to two counts of assaulting police officers with a dangerous weapon.Only former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio has received a longer sentence in the Jan. 6 attack. Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years for orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 presidential election.Dempsey called his conduct ""reprehensible"" and apologized to the police officers whom he assaulted,""You were performing your duties, and I responded with hostility and violence,"" he said before learning his sentence.Justice Department prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of 21 years and 10 months for Dempsey, a former construction worker and fast-food restaurant employee. Dempsey's violence was so extreme that he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him, prosecutors wrote.""David Dempsey is political violence personified,"" Assistant US Attorney Douglas Brasher told the judge.Defense attorney Amy Collins, who sought a sentence of 6 years and six months, described the government's sentencing recommendation as ""ridiculous.""""It makes him a statistic,"" she said. ""It doesn't consider the person he is, how much he has grown.""Dempsey was wearing a tactical vest, a helmet and an American flag gaiter covering his face when he attacked police at a tunnel leading to the Lower West Terrace doors. He shot pepper spray at Metropolitan Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen just as another rioter yanked at the officer's gas mask, prosecutors wrote.""The searing spray burned Detective Nguyen's lungs, throat, eyes, and face and left him gasping for breath, fearing he might lose consciousness and be overwhelmed by the mob,"" they wrote.Dempsey then struck MPD Sgt. Jason Mastony in the head with a metal crutch, cracking the shield on his gas mask and cutting his head.""I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang. I was able to stand again and hold the line for a few more minutes until another assault by rioters pushed the police line back away from the threshold of the tunnel,"" Mastony said in a statement submitted to the court.Dempsey has been jailed since his arrest in August 2021.His criminal record in California includes convictions for burglary, theft and assault. The assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019, gathering near the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people peacefully demonstrating against then-President Trump, prosecutors said.""The peaceful protest turned violent as Dempsey took a canister of bear spray from his pants and dispersed it at close range against several protesters,"" they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to 200 days of jail time.Dempsey engaged in at least three other acts of ""vicious political violence"" that didn't lead to criminal charges ""for various reasons,"" according to prosecutors. They said Dempsey struck a counter-protester over the head with a skateboard at a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles, used the same skateboard to assault someone at an August 2020 protest in Tujunga, California, and attacked a protester with pepper spray and a metal bat during a August 2020 protest in Beverly Hills, California.More than 1,400 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes. Over 900 of them have been convicted and sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to the 22 years that Tarrio received.",David Nicholas Dempsey's sentence is among the longest among hundreds of Capitol riot prosecutions.

He said they discovered the woman entangled in a conveyer belt system in a baggage room.Police said she was 57 years old but have not released her name.The baggage room wasn't publicly accessible, Langford said, and it's not clear how she found her way into it. Scott Allen, a spokesperson for the US Department of Labor, said an official with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration visited the scene and learned the woman was not an airport employee.Firefighters turned the scene over to police investigators, and Langford had no more details. The Chicago Police Department 's communications office said in an email to The Associated Press that the woman was found unresponsive and pronounced dead on the scene. Detectives have opened an investigation, the office said.The police communications office initially said the woman was discovered at 2:27 am, creating confusion about why firefighters and paramedics didn't arrive for more than five hours.

She was actually discovered at 7:30 am., prompting a 911 call.The footage only shows her walking and does not show what happened to her.Police spokesperson Nathaniel Blackman clarified during a phone interview with The Associated Press that no one was watching the surveillance cameras in real time and investigators reviewed the footage after the woman's body was discovered.",Firefighters found a dead woman entangled in machinery Thursday in a non-public baggage-processing area at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.

The US Capitol Police instructed all personnel within the Capitol Complex to promptly relocate to their office's designated severe weather shelter locations and told no one to exit the building until directedThey also indicated people if they were not near their offices, then to go to the nearest office and shelter there, Daily Mail reported.The inclement weather also affected the Washington Nationals baseball team, causing a delay in their scheduled game on Thursday.Storm Debby has struck South Carolina for the second time as it travels up the East Coast, causing destructive tornadoes and new flooding. The storm has left over 130,000 individuals without electricity due to tornado activity, which has also resulted in extensive structural damage.According to the National Hurricane Center , Debby made landfall early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, initially as a Category 1 hurricane, leading to a temporary closure of a section of Interstate 95. The tropical storm is now expected to continue moving inland, bringing heavy rainfall and potential flooding to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions by the weekend.New York City airports faced ground delays, and parts of New Jersey were under a tornado threat, as the remnants of Storm Debby approached the region on Friday morning, the New York Post reported.Due to thunderstorms, LaGuardia Airport in Queens implemented a ground stop at 7.15 am, which was later reduced to a ground delay by 8.21 am and that travelers should still anticipate delays exceeding an hour, the PIX11 reported.The FAA said that Newark Liberty International Airport experienced departure delays of approximately 45 minutes, while John F.

Interestingly, it also resembled a hat sold by the pop sensation Chappell Roan .Chappell Roan wrote on X over a reposted image of her “Midwest Princess” hat next to the Harris-Walz camo hat; “Is this real?”Walz, known for his passion for hunting, has frequently been seen wearing a camouflage hat during public appearances. The Harris campaign has capitalised on this by offering a similar hat in their campaign store, aiming to highlight Walz's Midwestern roots and appeal to rural voters in crucial swing states.However, the hat has not been well-received by all. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has criticised the campaign's move. The executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action told the Washington Post that ""a camo hat can’t camouflage the fact that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are gun-grabbing radicals who support confiscating firearms from law-abiding hunters and gun owners.""Despite his hunting background, Walz during his tenure enacted legislation mandating universal background checks and implementing a red-flag law. Similarly, Harris has long been a proponent of tighter gun control, as evidenced by her Rose Garden speech last year in which the vice president called for ""passing reasonable gun safety laws.""In her speech, Harris had said: ""President Biden and I believe in the Second Amendment, but we also know common sense solutions are at hand.""Emily L Newman, an art history and liberal studies professor at Texas A&M University at Commerce said that the viral hat aligns well with the image the Walz campaign aims to project, arguing that it lends more credit to his argument for gun regulation, the Washington Post reported.""I thought it was a great campaign move to cash in on what Walz brings to the campaign, which is this Midwestern sensibility,"" Newman said.""He’s talked about being a hunter, but then he’s such a staunch advocate for gun control that it’s a great thing to play up for the Democrats,"" he added.Walz recently signed a bill into law that encompassed universal background checks and a red-flag provision, but he is also a passionate hunter who takes pride in his marksmanship skills.""That’s what JD Vance’s shtick is, talking about guns,"" Walz told Anderson Cooper last month adding that, ""I guarantee you he can’t shoot pheasants.""","Tim Walz, Governor of Minnesota, made his debut as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate on Tuesday evening.

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others. In 2024, the use of VPNs among local internet users surged significantly, primarily to access X, which has been banned in the country since February 19.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112258055,imgsize-604937,width-400,resizemode-4/112258055.jpg"
