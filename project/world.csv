NEW DELHI: Congress leader Pawan Khera on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , invoking US President Donald Trump ’s repeated claims -- including the latest one -- that he mediated a peaceful agreement between India and Pakistan after India's retaliatory strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.Targeting PM Modi over Trump's latest remarks about brokering a ceasefire, Khera said, ""Trump is coiled around Modi like a snake. And yesterday, Rahul Gandhi handed him the perfect chance to wriggle out of the mess. Just say Trump was lying about the ceasefire. Simple, right? But no. Modi is allergic to taking Rahul ji’s advice. And voilà, today the snake is back, coiled tighter than ever, hissing bitter truths into Modi’s ear.""Trump, in his most recent comments on India, also mentioned the anticipated trade deal between the US and India. While answering questions on high tariffs imposed by India, Trump said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country...""Just a day earlier, during the Operation Sindoor debate in Lok Sabha, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had accused the PM Modi- led government of using the military operation to protect the Prime Minister's image.He further challenged PM Modi to call Trump a ""liar"" in Parliament, over the latter's repeated claims of using trade leverage to end the India-Pakistan conflict. ""If Narendra Modi has even 50 per cent of the courage of Indira Gandhi, he should declare in the House that Trump is lying about the ceasefire,"" Rahul Gandhi said.In Parliament, PM Modi responded firmly, saying that no foreign leader had asked India to halt Operation Sindoor, thereby directly countering Trump’s repeated remarks. ""No world leader asked for suspension of Operation Sindoor,"" the PM said. His comment came in response to the opposition’s demand that he show courage and publicly dispute Trump’s statements.",Congress leader Pawan Khera on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""How can one find closure when she lies scattered like that?"" asked Mohammed Koya, kin to the Panakkadan family.One year has passed since a rain-triggered landslide on July 30 turned Chooralmala and Mundakkai into ghost villages in Kerala's Wayanad.

Woman judicial officer quits over 'harasser's' promotion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-judicial-officer-quits-over-harassers-promotion/articleshow/122985027.cms,"'Was subjected to harassment for speaking against judge'

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic development, a junior woman judicial officer has resigned, protesting the appointment of a district judge as an HC judge despite her serious allegations of misconduct against him. In her resignation letter, she lamented that the constitutional courts rewarded a judge who had severely harassed and tormented her.The judicial officer, reinstated by the SC's stinging judgment of Feb 28 that termed her termination ""arbitrary and illegal"", said the district judge, who had orchestrated her sufferings, was rewarded with a high court judgeship.The man I accused, not anonymously but with documented facts and the raw courage only a wounded woman can summon, was not even asked to explain. No inquiry. No notice. No hearing. No accountability. He is now titled as justice, a cruel joke upon the very word, said the judicial officer, who sent her resignation on Monday.Alleging that she was subjected to unrelenting harassment for speaking against the judge, she asked what message the appointment sent to judiciary's daughters - ""That they may be assaulted, humiliated, and institutionally erased for their only real crime was to dare to believe that the system would protect them.""""The same judiciary that sermonises about transparency from the bench failed to even follow basic tenets of natural justice within its own halls. The same institution that teaches equality before law, handpicked power over truth. He, who orchestrated my suffering was not even questioned but rewarded,"" she further said. In her resignation letter, she wrote, ""I sign off not as an officer of the court, but as a victim of its silence. Where were the rules then? Where was the revered transparency then? You refused to protect one of your own. You refused to uphold the principles you preach. You refused to be just - where it mattered the most.

Mystery over ghost litigant in SC deepens as 3rd lawyer distances himself from case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-over-ghost-litigant-in-sc-deepens-as-3rd-lawyer-distances-himself-from-case/articleshow/122984613.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mystery around a 'ghost litigant' in Supreme Court deepened further as the third lawyer whose name appeared in the order sheet for the litigant told the court Tuesday that he was not involved in any way in the case and did not know how his name cropped up. Suspecting the role of some outsider and not lawyers, the bar associations sought a police inquiry and forensic examination of documents to catch the culprit which the apex court agreed to consider.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant. Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC.The names of four lawyers were mentioned in the order out of which three are known names in the field of litigation but no one had heard of the fourth advocate. It came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party did not practice law any more and he and his daughter, whose name was also there, were not even aware of the case.The court, thereafter, directed the third lawyer to appear before it.Appearing before a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar, advocate Ratan Lal told the court that he did not do anything and he had nothing to do with the case. As all three lawyers refused their involvement in the case and the fourth lawyer remains untraced, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Supreme Court Advocates On-Record Association (SCAORA) told the bench that lawyers were not involved in the wrongdoing.SCAORA president Vipin Nair said an inquiry was needed in the case and who would conduct it was very important. ""The blame or charge of any wrongdoing can't be straightaway ascribed to AOR or lawyers since the pleadings indicate that the possibility of the petitioner engaging in fabrication can't be ruled out. A thorough enquiry is therefore necessary,"" Nair told the bench.It was also argued police should be asked to hold an inquiry. The court, after a brief hearing, said it would consider all aspects and pass an order.

Both Hamza and Jibran were also 'A-grade' LeT terrorists.The three were identified by family members of two locals arrested on June 22 by NIA - Parvaiz and Bashir. The duo had provided food and shelter to them at their 'dhok (seasonal hut)' some 2km from Baisaran prior to the attack. A source said they were paid around Rs 3,000 by the terrorists.Shah had come to LS armed with conclusive evidence of direct involvement of the three terrorists in the Pahalgam attack as well as their Pakistani roots.The ballistic report, he said, matched the cartridges and barrel of the weapons recovered from the slain terrorists, with the spent casings secured from the attack site.

Shooter drove from Las Vegas with alleged NFL grievances and suicide note referencing CTE

Victims include a heroic NYPD officer and injured NFL employee as city mourns

FAQs

Q1: Who was the gunman in the NYC NFL headquarters shooting?

Q2: What did Shane Devon Tamura claim in his suicide note?

In a tragic and chilling act of violence that has left New York City reeling, a 27-year-old man fatally shot four people before turning the gun on himself inside a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper that houses the NFL ’s corporate offices. The attack marks the deadliest shooting in the city in 25 years and has reignited national debates around mental health, football-related brain injuries, and public safety.Authorities identified the gunman as Shane Devon Tamura, a former competitive football player who traveled from Las Vegas to New York with a semi-automatic rifle and apparent intent. According to law enforcement sources, Tamura left behind a haunting suicide note expressing anger toward the NFL and claiming he suffered from CTE, a degenerative brain disease linked to repetitive head trauma.In the note, Tamura wrote: “Terry Long football gave me CTE and it caused me to drink a gallon of antifreeze... You can’t go against the NFL, they’ll squash you.” He reportedly requested his brain be studied, adding, “Study my brain please I’m sorry. Tell Rick I’m sorry for everything.” Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers lineman, was diagnosed with CTE after his death in 2005 by suicide.The note has intensified speculation that Tamura’s mental health decline may be tied to untreated head trauma from his football years.Police confirmed he had a documented history of mental illness.Among those killed was Officer Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, remembered as a devout man of faith and a devoted family man.

Lai Ching-te's trip to Latin America: Typhoon Danas or Chinese interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/lai-ching-tes-trip-to-latin-america-typhoon-danas-or-chinese-interference-why-did-Taiwanese-president-cancel-tour/articleshow/122987397.cms,"



Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te reportedly postponed a planned visit to Latin America, sparking debate over the reason behind the delay.Lai was speculated to visit the region next month as part of efforts to reinforce ties with Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies, particularly as several countries have recently switched allegiance to China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, The Guardian reported.However, the Taiwanese government said the president did not have any overseas travel plans because of mounting domestic concerns, including recent natural disasters and ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States.The country is still reeling from Typhoon Danas, which slammed the island’s densely populated west coast earlier this month, bringing record winds and widespread damage to homes and power infrastructure.Embassy officials in Guatemala cited “typhoon that caused many natural disasters” as the reason for the visit being postponed. A source told Reuters that Lai needed to focus on organising his administration’s response to the extreme weather at home.Meanwhile, conflicting reports have emerged surrounding a potential stopover in New York that was originally part of Lai’s itinerary.The AP quoted a source familiar with discussions, who said the US “had asked Taipei to rearrange the transit, not go through New York.”According to the Financial Times, the US denied permission for the stopover after China raised objections with Washington.The United States has historically permitted such transits by high-level Taiwanese officials, but Lai’s proposed stop was expected to provoke Beijing at a time when President Donald Trump is seeking a trade deal with China. The Chinese government routinely protests any signs of support for Taiwan by Washington.Commenting on the issue, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said during a routine briefing that no official plans had been confirmed, making the issue “hypothetical.”“At this point, there have been no … travel plans for the president. There has been, as a result, nothing cancelled,” she said. Bruce reiterated that US transit practices for Taiwanese leaders remain “fully consistent with our longstanding policy and practice.”Jason Hsu, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former legislator in Taiwan, pointed out that Taipei regularly coordinates such transits with Washington and called it “abnormal” for the US not to approve the stopover, especially as such visits are covered under the Taiwan Relations Act.“If the US had prevented Lai’s stopover,” he added, “the Trump administration would appear to be accommodating China’s red lines.”Democrats in the US were quick to criticise the Trump administration. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House’s China committee, called the move “another example of the Trump administration caving to China in hopes of reaching a trade deal.”“Presidents of both parties have allowed Taiwan officials to transit through the US in the past, and now should be no different,” he said in a statement.","Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te reportedly postponed a planned visit to Latin America, sparking debate over the reason behind the delay.

Trump's ICE boost: US President urges 'courageous men and women' to join immigration and customs; promises to 'take GREAT care',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-ice-boost-us-president-urges-courageous-men-and-women-to-join-immigration-and-customs-promises-to-take-great-care/articleshow/122986841.cms,"



US President Donald Trump reinforced his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling the agency’s agents “brave” and praising their ongoing efforts to expel what he described as “the WORST of the WORST” criminals from the country.Taking to social media platform Truth Social he said, “Our Brave ICE Law Enforcement Agents are getting the WORST of the WORST Criminals out of our Country — Terrorists, pedophiles, MS-13 gang members, murderers, rapists, drug and human traffickers. They’re getting these SLEAZEBAGS, the SCUM of the Earth that Crooked Joe Biden let in, OUT OF HERE, and getting them out, FAST.”“We need MORE courageous men and women to, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. Join ICE now. We will take GREAT care of you, just like you take care of us!” the he wrote on Tuesday.The post comes as the Trump administration plans to move forward with a massive expansion of its immigration enforcement agenda, which, as per CNN, includes a record $75 billion allocation to ICE from the president’s sweeping agenda bill,.The funding aims to bolster detention capacity and ramp up enforcement and removal operations, including hiring more agents across the country.A Homeland Security official told CNN that ICE “keeps getting kicked in the teeth” despite increased praise from top Republican leaders.Trump and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem have both repeatedly praised the agency’s work. “These are strong people — tough people — that love our country,” Trump said at the White House last week.“If they weren’t tough, they wouldn’t survive.”But behind the public praise lies growing pressure and tension inside the agency. ICE officers have reportedly been working around the clock under intense scrutiny, managing daily calls with the White House and facing sharp backlash from members of the public and immigration advocates alike.Since Trump issued a mass deportation order in January, immigration and customs enforcement has come under fire from all directions, with some in the administration saying it’s not doing enough, others arguing it’s gone too far, and angry members of the public taking drastic steps to block its actions.",President Donald Trump took to social media to praise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) He called the agency’s agents “brave” and praised their efforts to expel “the WORST of the WORST” criminals from the country.

US President Donald Trump claimed that he played no part in the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, but suggested that the long-running host was axed due to a “pure lack of TALENT” and mounting financial losses.“Everybody is saying that I was solely responsible for the firing of Stephen Colbert from CBS, Late Night. That is not true!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Tuesday (local time).“The reason he was fired was a pure lack of TALENT, and the fact that this deficiency was costing CBS $50 Million Dollars a year in losses — And it was only going to get WORSE!”Trump, also went on to suggest that other late-night hosts would soon meet a similar fate.“Next up will be an even less talented Jimmy Kimmel, and then, a weak, and very insecure, Jimmy Fallon. The only real question is, who will go first? Show Biz and Television is a very simple business. If you get Ratings, you can say or do anything. If you don’t, you always become a victim. Colbert became a victim to himself, the other two will follow.”Trump’s post followed CBS’s announcement last Thursday that The Late Show would end in May 2026, marking the close of a 33-year run.According to BBC, the network called this move “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night [television]” and insisted it was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters.”Colbert, who broke the news to his audience during a taping of the show that evening, was met with boos and cries of “no” from the crowd at the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York.“I do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners,” BBC cited the host.“It’s not just the end of our show, but it’s the end of The Late Show on CBS. I’m not being replaced. This is all just going away,” he said.“It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it.”Colbert took over the programme from David Letterman in 2015 and became one of Trump’s most prominent critics in the late-night television sphere.The cancellation came two weeks after CBS parent company Paramount settled a lawsuit filed by Trump. The president had accused the network of deceptively editing a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 rival, Kamala Harris, to “tip the scales in favour of the Democratic party.”Colbert’s show was has long been criticised by conservative commentators over alleged political bias. According to MRC NewsBusters, a right-leaning media watchdog, the programme hosted 176 liberal guests and only one Republican between 2022 and 2025.The 61-year-old presenter’s frequent jabs at Donald Trump have fuelled speculation that the cancellation may have had political undertones, despite the agency citing financial reasons.The end of The Late Show also comes amid ongoing merger talks between Paramount and Skydance Media, a deal that would need federal government approval. If the show concludes as planned in 2026, CBS will be left without a late-night comedy programme for the first time since 1993.",US President Donald Trump claims that he played no part in the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

U.S. President Donald Trump officially opened his latest 18‑hole golf course, Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, near Aberdeen, Scotland. The opening, which was accompanied by fireworks and traditional piping, capped a five-day trip that was largely focused on boosting his family's golf business and promoting the new course, designed by Eric Trump, along the wild Scottish coast. Trump then teed off on the first hole with a foursome following the ceremony.Trump spoke to a gathering of scalpers, athletes, and press before wielding a pair of gold scissors. He described the project as a “labor of love” his son Eric had turned to and referred to the new course as his own “Mona Lisa."" Trump also touted Scottish roots, mentioning the Isle of Lewis, where his late mother once lived, and praised his team for bringing what he called ""incredible progress.""In fact, on July 29, 2025, the ribbon‑cutting itself, the president counted down: “Three, two, one- Let’s go.” He pressed a button on the digital screen that read something like “1-2-3,” which set off fireworks, officially opening the course. Ceremonial flourishes were provided by bagpipers and the backdrop of the North Sea coastline.Donald Trump and Eric Trump took to the course shortly after the ceremony to play with a group of professional golfers, which included Rich Beem and Paul McGinley.The officials were welcomed later that morning by former football stars Andriy Shevchenko and Gianfranco Zola and Scottish golfing greats, including Stephen Gallacher, in a colorful instance of diplomacy, sport, and branding.Trump said he intended to play an entire 18 holes before leaving for Washington, although he characterized his game as a ""quick"" respite from an otherwise busy global itinerary.

BENGALURU: Tricked by an overcast sky, 68-year-old Seethappa jumped out of his bed around 3am, put on his walking gear and hit the street for morning walk – and a cup of tea in a neighbourhood shop, a routine for years.To beat the chill, he wrapped himself in a black blanket, realising little that a pack of dogs would attack him, leading to a gory end minutes later.His son Venkatesh Seethappa, 43, said his father was healthy and active, and had no illness except mild asthma. ""Today, he's gone, because of stray dogs,"" said Venkatesh.Around 3.30am, Seethappa woke up believing it was around 5am — his usual time for a walk in Kempegowda Layout, Kodigehalli. A little later, he was attacked by dogs. ""Even at that hour, hearing the shrieks, neighbours rushed out, tried to chase the dogs away by throwing water, banging gates, and hitting sticks on the ground, but the dogs wouldn't relent. They mauled his face, hands, legs… It was brutal,"" he said.Seethappa was a familiar figure in the neighbourhood. A farmer, who cultivated corn, sold his land a few years ago. Since then, he had been spending days tending to his six cows.""He had a morning routine. He'd have his tea, a couple of biscuits, and take the cows out for grazing. Never once had we imagined that something like this would happen to him, especially in our locality,"" Venkatesh told TOI.Around 4am, Seethappa's wife Lakshmamma sensed something amiss when she didn't find him in their room. Alarmed, she woke up her sons, and the family began searching for him. ""It was at the tea stall that we were informed that an elderly man had died in a dog attack. A neighbour broke the news: It was our father,"" said Venkatesh.The tragedy has reopened an old wound for the local residents: That of the long-standing problem of stray dog attacks and BBMP's inaction.""The entire layout is scared of stepping out for a walk, especially in the dark. Although we don't encounter these aggressive dogs during the day, the situation is bad at night. We've raised complaints with BBMP multiple times, but there's no permanent solution. Today it's my father, tomorrow it could be someone else,"" Venkatesh trailed off.Chandraiya, joint director of animal husbandry, BBMP, told TOI the dogs might have been frightened by the man at that hour and attacked him and promised suitable necessary action.In Aug 2024, 76-year-old Rajdulari Sinha, a retired schoolteacher, was attacked by 10-12 stray dogs during her early-morning walk inside Air Force East residential camp in Jalahalli. She sustained multiple grievous injuries and was declared dead at a hospital. The two deaths occurred in the Yelahanka zone in less than a year.","68-year-old farmer killed by stray dogs in Bengaluru. His son Venkatesh Seethappa, 43, said his father was healthy and active.

HYDERABAD: In a twist to the surrogacy case involving a fertility clinic in Secunderabad, police have found that the baby was allegedly bought from a poor family and given to the city couple who sought IVF treatment in 2024.Police said the clinic suggested that the couple opt for surrogacy instead and assured them that the child would be biologically theirs. They were charged Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.Read also: IVF or infant trade? Dr. Patchipala Namratha linked to 2020 child trafficking case On Sunday, Hyderabad police arrested eight people including prime accused Dr Athaluri Namratha (64) of Universal Srushti Fertility Centre, Dr Nargula Sadanandam (41) an anesthetist from the state-run Gandhi Hospital and agents and technicians.They were booked on charges of cheating clients in the name of a surrogacy procedure and running a baby-selling racket. Cops also found that Srushti's licence had been cancelled in 2021. Dr Namratha was running it illegally.She has been operating three more centres in Kondapur (Hyderabad), Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam. All of them were raided on Sunday.""The latest case appears to be only the tip of the iceberg; there could be many such cases.We are probing other couples who sought surrogacy and IVF treatment at different branches of the fertility centre to ascertain this,"" said S Rashmi Perumal, DCP (north zone).Read also: Hyderabad surrogacy clinic lost registration in 2021, but doctor continued to run it illegally Previously, Dr Namratha came under scrutiny twice – in 2016 and 2020. In the first case her licence was suspended for five years by the Telangana Medical Council after an NRI couple from the US alleged that the newborn given to them, allegedly through surrogacy, was not biologically related to them. Then in 2020 Vizag police arrested Dr Namratha and five others for allegedly trafficking newborns.Police said that more than 10 cases were previously registered against the accused doctor and her clinic at three places – Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Guntur.The latest incident came to light on July 26 when a city-based couple approached the Gopalapuram police alleging that the baby handed to them by the clinic – also known as Srushti Test Tube Baby Centre – following commercial surrogacy, was not biologically related to the father. They had independently run a DNA test to establish this. The couple allegedly paid Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.""After interrogating the prime accused we have established that it is not a case of surrogacy. Dr Namratha and her employees were selling infants to childless couples bought from poor pregnant women who were lured with money,"" said the DCP.She added: ""The biological parents of the baby, who have also been arrested, belong to Assam and were living in Hyderabad. They were paid Rs 90,000 and the mother was sent to Visakhapatnam for delivery.""The baby boy was two days old when he was sold to the complainant couple under the impression that it is their biological son.Among the others arrested are Dr Namratha's son P Jayanth Krishna (25), a practising advocate who used to manage his mother's funds, two employees of the clinic C Kalyani Atchayyamma (40) and G Chenna Rao (37), and an agent Dhanasri Santoshi (38). The biological parents of the infant have been identified as Mohammed Ali Adik (38) and Nasreen Begum (25). While seven of the accused have been sent to 14-day judicial remand to Chanchalguda jail, C Kalyani, an employee at Visakhapatnam branch is being brought to Hyderabad.""Apart from the illegal trade, the accused are also guilty of indulging in commercial surrogacy which is illegal in India. Only altruistic surrogacy is allowed,"" the DCP said.Senior police officials said the complainants, originally from Rajasthan, approached the fertility centre in Aug 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. During the visit, Dr Namratha conducted fertility tests and advised the couple to opt for surrogacy. They were asked to visit the clinic's Visakhapatnam branch for further procedures.""They were assured that a surrogate would be arranged by the clinic and that their embryo would be transplanted. Over a span of nine months, the couple made multiple payments for consultation, treatment, and surrogate care,"" said a police official, adding, ""Throughout this period, the clinic provided regular updates claiming that the pregnancy was progressing smoothly.""In June 2025, the couple was informed that the surrogate mother delivered a baby boy via C-section in Visakhapatnam. They were asked to pay an additional delivery charge – of Rs 2 lakh – before taking custody of the child. The clinic claimed that the child's biological father was demanding more money.""Upon reaching Vizag, the baby was handed over along with documents falsely indicating that the child was biologically theirs, including a fabricated birth certificate,"" said the cop.When the complainants asked Dr Namratha for the DNA report they found that it was not done before the registration of the baby on their name. However, the clinic representatives kept falsely assuring the couple that the child belonged to them.Suspicion arose when the couple opted for a DNA test of all three in a forensics lab in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, which revealed that neither of them shared any genetic link with the child.""When they tried to seek clarification from the clinic, Dr Namratha initially blocked their numbers before threatening them and denying access to further documentation,"" said the police official.She said that the couple, fed up with the clinic's behaviour, approached Gopalapuram police around a week ago and lodged a complaint.""With malicious intentions, the accused Dr Namratha did not let the complainant couple meet the biological mother, who they believed was the surrogate,"" said the DCPFollowing the complaint, the police, along with health dept officials, seized the fertility centre at Gopalapuram. Officials said they found equipment which substantiated the facts that the accused were offering IVF treatments, creating live embryos, and carrying out medical procedures without any proper license.""Previously, when health officials visited the clinic for inspection on a quarterly basis, it was closed and seemed to be a residential complex. But, it turns out, patients were coming discreetly,"" said Dr J Venkati, district medical health officer (DMHO), Hyderabad.The DMHO added: ""During the recent crackdown, equipment for sex determination and nitrous oxide were also found.

A sunny day at San Lorenzo beach was interrupted by a dramatic plane dive that left spectators in shock, as a Spanish Air Force EF-18 Hornet suddenly swooped low over the water during the 2025 Festival Aereo Internacional de Gijon.Footage shows the EF-18 Hornet continuing a normal path before a sudden dive, descending alarmingly close to the beach. However, it climbed back up moments later, trailing dark smoke and leaving the crowd stunned.The video clip left many confused by this sudden movement, which was later clarified by Spain’s Air and Space Force.What initially appeared to be a dangerous mishap was a “part of the standard protocol to protect both the pilot's safety and the public's safety,” it said.“Our aviators are trained to react in milliseconds to any unforeseen event,” the force wrote in a statement on social media platform X.“In this case, the pilot acted with exemplary speed and professionalism, avoiding a possible impact without compromising the display.”The incident took place on 28 July 2025 during a low-altitude flypast over the bay, with more than 300,000 spectators, making it the most attended airshow in Gijon’s history, as per Aerotime.Despite the dramatic moment, no injuries or damage were reported, and the aircraft returned safely to base.The lineup for the show included performances from the Spanish Air and Space Force, Navy, Search and Rescue units, the National Police, and aerobatic pilots flying light aircraft.Such close encounters are not uncommon. Just last month, a Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon struck a seagull mid-performance at the Aire25 airshow in Murcia. The impact shattered the cockpit canopy and punctured the windshield, forcing the pilot to abort the routine and make an emergency landing. The pilot escaped unscathed, though the aircraft suffered extensive damage.According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), more than 270,000 wildlife-related aircraft incidents occurred globally between 2016 and 2021, with over 8,000 causing significant damage. Bird strikes are especially prevalent at low altitudes near coastlines and migratory paths, conditions typical of summer airshows.","A Spanish Air Force EF-18 Hornet suddenly swooped low over the water during an airshow in Gijon.

A convicted felon out on parole has been charged with capital murder in the fatal shooting of a sheriff’s deputy in Kansas City, Kansas. Shawn M Harris, 38, who had previously served time for aggravated robbery and other crimes, allegedly opened fire on officers responding to a routine call, killing Wyandotte county deputy Elijah Ming.Authorities say the shooting occurred Saturday when officers responded to a “standby” call, a routine police presence to keep the peace, after a woman reported that Harris had threatened friends who were helping her move out of his home.As deputy Ming and a Kansas City police officer approached the residence, Harris allegedly opened fire, striking Ming multiple times. The deputy died later at a hospital.“We do thousands of these types of calls a year,” Kansas City Police chief Karl Oakman said during a news conference on Tuesday as quoted by AP.In addition to the capital murder charge, Harris is also charged with violating a Kansas law that prohibits people with felony records from possessing firearms. The charges were filed Monday in Wyandotte County District Court by district attorney Mark Dupree Sr.Harris made his first court appearance Tuesday. District Judge Daniel Cahill set his bond at $2 million. He is currently being held in neighboring Johnson County.Dupree said he will consult with Ming’s family before deciding within the next 10 days whether to pursue the death penalty. The only alternative sentence would be life in prison without the possibility of parole. Kansas currently has nine men on death row, but the state has not carried out an execution since 1965, according to AP.The state’s death penalty defense unit has been appointed to represent Harris, as he could not afford an attorney.Harris was paroled in Kansas in October 2023 after pleading guilty to seven felony charges between 2012 and 2013 in both Kansas and Missouri. His convictions include aggravated robbery, attempted aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and felony theft in Wyandotte County, as well as felony tampering with a motor vehicle in Lafayette County, Missouri.He was transferred from Kansas to Missouri in 2013 to face additional charges and pled guilty to assault while serving time there. Harris returned to Kansas in 2021 and was released on parole two years later.","Shawn M Harris, 38, allegedly opened fire on officers responding to a routine call, killing Wyandotte county deputy Elijah Ming.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out attending the G20 summit in South Africa this November, citing what he described as “very bad policies” and repeating widely discredited claims that white citizens in the country are being systematically targeted and killed.Asked aboard Air Force One whether he would travel to the leaders’ summit in November, Trump said, “No, I think maybe I'll send somebody else, because I've had a lot of problems with South Africa. They have some very bad policies... A lot of people are being killed. So I think I probably won't. I'd like to, but I don't think I will,” as quoted by AFP.Trump has repeatedly criticised South Africa during his second term, promoting claims that white citizens, particularly farmers, are being targeted. The claims were amplified by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa.The Trump administration has also taken issue with South Africa’s land expropriation law, signed in January, which aims to address land ownership inequalities rooted in the apartheid era.Washington has opposed the law, arguing it could lead to arbitrary confiscations of white-owned land. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has rejected that interpretation, defending the policy as part of broader efforts at economic justice.In May, Trump stunned South African officials during a White House meeting with Ramaphosa by playing a video he claimed showed a ""genocide"" of the white minority, with reporters present.The Trump administration has cited the persecution claims in granting asylum to South Africa’s Afrikaner minority. The US also imposed 30 per cent tariffs on South African goods starting August 1.Earlier this year, US secretary of state Marco Rubio also boycotted a G20 foreign ministers’ meeting held in Johannesburg.","US President Donald Trump ruled out attending the G20 summit in South Africa this November.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the H-1B visa program a total scam as Americans are getting laid off, making way for foreign workers. H-1B is the visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign workers. It has become a contentious issue as US big techs including Microsoft, Intel announced major layoffs. Republicans want H-1B to end while the Donald Trump administration is planning major changes in the program.“They’re laying off all these American workers and then they’re importing H1B visa people to work for cheaper. I think that’s a total scam. I don’t think that’s good. Yes, it is legal the way they’re doing it. I acknowledge that. They’re using something that’s on the books. But is that good policy for us as a country to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H1B (visas)? And then they do chain migration from the H1B. So the H1B is bringing in other folks,” DeSantis said.DeSantis compared the dynamic to indentured servitude, citing how H‑1B workers are tied to a single employer, which companies exploit to cut costs. Earlier in January 2025, he called out broad issues with the H‑1B system, sharply criticizing practices where Americans train H‑1B workers who then replace them, asking how such a system could even be acceptable.The comment came as recently vice president JD Vance spoke about the H-1B issue and said the displacement of American workers makes him worried. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me.""""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bullshit story,"" he said.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the H-1B visa program a total scam.

The father of NYPD officer Didarul Islam, who lost his life in the deadly Manhattan shooting that claimed the lives of five people Monday evening, grew so distraught when he learned of his son’s death at the hands of a gunman that he suffered a stroke.Islam’s cousin, Muhammad Mainul Islam, told the New York Post that the news also deeply affected the officer’s pregnant wife, who was rushed to the hospital by police on Tuesday morning.“They are all crying,” the cousin said. “There is no brother- only him. The family is really feeling a big problem. His wife had the doctor’s appointment. I heard one police officer from the precinct, she took [her] to the hospital.”“His father went last night to see him. When he heard the message, he had a stroke, feeling bad.

The shooting occurred around 6.30 pm inside a 44-story building on Park Avenue.According to police, Tamura exited a double-parked car with an M4 rifle and immediately opened fire.He killed four people, and injured one other before taking his own life on the 33rd floor.The shooting took place during the evening rush hour, prompting a large emergency response.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a prominent supporter of US President Donald Trump and a vocal figure in the MAGA movement, has become the first member of her party in Congress to describe the situation in the Gaza Strip as a ""genocide. ""Her comments mark a significant departure from the stance held by the vast majority of Republicans, who have consistently voiced unconditional support for Israel.In a post on X Monday evening, Greene said, ""It's the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct 7 in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza.""Her statement was the strongest in a recent string of increasingly critical remarks about Israel’s conduct in the ongoing war, reflecting a growing concern among some on the right over the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza, reported The New York Times.On Sunday, Greene said, ""I can unequivocally say that what happened to innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th was horrific. Just as I can unequivocally say that what has been happening to innocent people and children in Gaza is horrific.""Greene’s remarks were seen as a direct rebuke of fellow Republican Rep Randy Fine of Florida, who has come under fire for his comments regarding the suffering of Palestinians.Fine had referred to images of starving children in Gaza as part of a campaign of ""Muslim terror propaganda"" and wrote, ""Release the hostages… until then, starve away.""Responding to this, Greene in her recent post added, ""A Jewish US Representative calling for the continued starvation of innocent people and children is disgraceful. His awful statement will actually cause more antisemitism.F ine, a freshman lawmaker and outspoken advocate for Israel, made the remarks the same day he was appointed to the House foreign affairs committee, a key body that shapes US foreign policy.Fine made his comments before Trump said there was ""real starvation"" happening in Gaza and made commitments to offer additional support to increase aid.""That's real starvation stuff- I see it, and you can't fake that,"" Trump said Monday after a series of meetings with European leaders while in Scotland. ""We have to get the kids fed.""Greene had already begun to pivot prior to Trump’s comments, joining a small but growing group within the MAGA movement expressing concern over the war’s impact on civilians.Earlier this month, Greene in another statement said, ""Israel bombed the Catholic Church in Gaza, and that entire population is being wiped out as they continue their aggressive war in Gaza.""That statement followed her unsuccessful attempt to lead a congressional push to strip $500 million in US military aid to Israel, part of the annual defense support package.","Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has become the first member of her party in Congress to describe the situation in the Gaza Strip as a ""genocide"" Greene's comments mark a significant departure from the stance held by the vast majority of Republicans, who have consistently voiced unconditional support for Israel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122979920,imgsize-890384,width-400,resizemode-4/122979920.jpg"

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data. Despite these soaring numbers, Pakistanis rarely featured among the top 10 nationalities crossing into Britain via small boats, suggesting they were entering through legal visa channels, and staying there.","Visa fraud network being run by some Pakistani consultants exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system. forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.
