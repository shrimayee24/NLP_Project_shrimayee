Who is Chip Roy?

The Fallout

Texas Representative Chip Roy has ignited a heated feud within the Republican Party, taking aim at his colleagues and former President Donald Trump over the federal debt ceiling negotiations . Roy’s fiery critique of his party’s fiscal policies and Trump’s retaliatory threats have deepened divisions ahead of critical discussions on the spending bill.In an impassioned tirade, Roy accused his Republican colleagues of abandoning fiscal responsibility , yelling, “You’ve added to the debt since you were given the majority again on November 5th. It’s embarrassing. It’s shameful.”He didn’t stop there, shredding the proposed bill for its $5 trillion increase to the national debt. “Yes, I think this bill is better than it was yesterday in certain respects. But to take this bill yesterday and congratulate yourself because it’s shorter in pages, but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine,” he said.“I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go forward to the American people and say you think this is fiscally responsible,” Roy continued. “It is absolutely ridiculous.”Roy’s pointed remarks drew a swift and scathing response from Trump, who took to Truth Social to brand the congressman an obstructionist. “The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory — All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself,” Trump wrote.Roy said his position on raising the debt limit is “simple.” “I am not going to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (racking up more debt) without significant & real spending cuts attached to it,” Roy said. “I’ve been negotiating to that end.”Trump escalated the feud with a follow-up post threatening to back primary challengers. “Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,” Trump declared. “I hope some talented challengers are getting ready in the Great State of Texas to go after Chip in the Primary. He won’t have a chance!”This time, the president-elect went after Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus , who is often aligned with Trump’s policy and political leanings. Roy and his fellow conservatives have been vehemently against any debit limit increases throughout their time in Congress but were blind-sided by Trump’s last-minute ask Wednesday.“The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory - All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Roy, 51, represents Texas’ 21st congressional district, covering areas north of San Antonio and a significant portion of Austin. Known for his conservative principles, Roy serves as Policy Chair of the House Freedom Caucus.Born in Bethesda, Maryland, Roy earned degrees in commerce and information systems from the University of Virginia and later graduated from the University of Texas School of Law. Before entering Congress, he was Chief of Staff for Senator Ted Cruz and served as the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas.Roy, married to Carrah Key since 2004, has two children. His estimated net worth is between $500,000 and $2 million, with an annual congressional salary of $174,000.Roy’s defiance highlights the ideological rift within the GOP over fiscal policy. While his hardline stance may resonate with conservative voters, Trump’s threats to support primary challengers cast uncertainty over Roy’s political future.","Texas Representative Chip Roy has ignited a heated feud within the Republican Party, taking aim at his colleagues and former President Donald Trump over the federal debt ceiling negotiations.

Republicans Against Trump

Mangione lookalike contest

A viral post on X (formerly Twitter) has ignited a firestorm, with users accusing a social media user of calling for the assassination of billionaire CEO Elon Musk. The controversy comes in the wake of a broader conversation about CEO accountability , following the high-profile killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson .The uproar began when a user named Bill Shea shared a post referencing Musk’s comments on a federal spending bill. Shea’s post included a screenshot from the X account, which read, “Elon Musk is literally everything MAGA Republicans accused George Soros of doing.” Shea added his own caption: “Folks, please do not forget Musk is a CEO of several companies. I say again, he’s a CEO. Do with that information as you will.”Critics quickly pounced on the post, accusing Shea of indirectly suggesting harm toward Musk. The uproar escalated, with Shea's profile being deactivated shortly after the post went viral, likely due to the barrage of negative attention.This controversy has unfolded against the backdrop of a growing movement online that has lionized Luigi Mangione , the alleged shooter in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The 26-year-old former Ivy League student has become a cult figure in certain corners of the internet, with some justifying his actions as a form of retaliation against the perceived failings of the U.S. healthcare system.The fascination with Mangione has even spilled into real-life events. Awas recently held in New York City, where Thompson’s murder took place. Supporters of Mangione argue that his actions have brought attention to systemic issues in the healthcare industry, though critics have condemned any glorification of violence.Adding fuel to the fire, former Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz sparked her own controversy on the platform Bluesky by sharing a celebratory image captioned “CEO DOWN.” Lorenz criticized corporate executives for their role in perpetuating systemic harm, though she clarified that she opposes violence. “I don’t support murder, but I also don’t think it’s wrong to call out the individuals enabling these systems of oppression,” she wrote.The viral nature of Shea’s post and its perceived endorsement of violence has reignited debates over accountability, free speech, and the role of billionaires in shaping public policy. Musk himself has not commented on the post, but his defenders have called for stricter moderation of violent rhetoric on social media.As the controversy unfolds, the boundaries between genuine frustration, online satire, and calls for action continue to blur, leaving the internet—and Musk’s supporters—divided.","A viral post on X (formerly Twitter) has ignited a firestorm, with users accusing a social media user of calling for the assassination of billionaire CEO Elon Musk.

Previous controversy

A woman has claimed that Prince Andrew, Duke of York, stared at her chest during an official crown engagement two decades ago. The incident allegedly occurred when she was 24 and working as an events manager, according to The Sun. She accompanied a doctor to meet the prince.“He wouldn’t leave me alone,” the unidentified woman told The Sun. She added that Andrew “seemed a lot more inclined to speak to me than the middle-aged female MD.”The Sun showed her a photo from the event, which she says appears to show Andrew looking at her chest. “I must have been listening to my MD talk and was looking her way, so hadn’t noticed him staring,” she explained.“Andrew obviously had other things on his mind.”“He was more interested in looking at my boobs than learning about our business,” she added.The woman wore a low-cut top with a jacket. “I was wearing a low-cut top, but had a jacket on, so wasn’t dressed outrageously,” she clarified, adding, “it was a bit creepy.”The woman's allegations come after recent disclosures about Andrew's ties to Yang, a businessman and suspected spy who has been banned from Britain. The Chinese national, known as ""H6"" in British espionage and media circles, is believed to be one of over 40,000 operatives associated with the department operating worldwide. However, Andrew denies sharing sensitive information with the businessman.Andrew was once regarded as a war hero for his service in Britain’s Royal Navy, during which he flew multiple missions in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina. In January 2022, Andrew relinquished his military titles and royal roles after his legal team failed to convince a US judge to dismiss a civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.He later reached a significant financial settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who claimed Andrew abused her when she was 17.Giuffre had alleged that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her to Andrew in the 1990s. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, was convicted for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Epstein's abuse.Andrew has consistently denied the allegations against him.",Woman claims Prince Andrew stared at her chest during an official engagement two decades ago.

US President Joe Biden's mental decline managed by White House staff from Day 1: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-joe-bidens-mental-decline-managed-by-white-house-staff-from-day-1-report/articleshow/116486209.cms,"Joe Biden

An explosive report reveals that White House aides have worked tirelessly to shield President Joe Biden from public scrutiny, carefully managing his schedule and limiting interactions due to concerns over his mental and physical stamina. The Wall Street Journal's investigation sheds light on how Biden’s cognitive struggles were concealed from the public, with aides making tactical adjustments to his daily activities, often rescheduling meetings to accommodate his “good days and bad days.”From the moment Biden, 82, assumed office in January 2021, staffers were tasked with managing his public appearances. With the backdrop of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the White House formed a protective shell around the aging commander-in-chief. By spring 2021, the administration began adjusting Biden's schedule to reflect his fluctuating energy levels, a pattern that became evident after he stumbled on the world stage. Meetings were often pushed to the afternoon, as Biden struggled with long hours and required a shorter window for functioning.One national security official told an aide in 2021: ""He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so we’re going to address this tomorrow."" As his public appearances continued, Biden frequently relied on notecards and struggled with off-script moments, misremembering names of foreign dignitaries or important facts, reported the Post.The White House was also concerned about Biden’s health affecting his public image. A source revealed that the administration hired a voice coach, Jeffrey Katzenberg, to help Biden with his faint, raspy tone. Additionally, staffers reportedly manipulated the news Biden received daily, ensuring he was only presented with positive reports. These steps were intended to maintain a polished image of Biden, despite growing concerns over his performance.The tension surrounding Biden's mental sharpness reached a high point during his preparation for a legal interview with special counsel Robert Hur over his mishandling of classified documents. Despite Biden’s insistence on the interview, staffers noticed that he struggled with recall and fluctuated in energy levels during prep sessions. Biden even forgot the year his son, Beau, passed away from cancer during a two-day session in October 2023.While Biden’s public image has faced scrutiny, his aides have continued to defend him. Deputy press secretary Andrew Bates denied the notion that Biden's engagements were minimal. He emphasized that Biden ""speaks with members of his cabinet daily"" and engages in frequent discussions about policy and national security. Bates argued that the modern work environment, where many meetings are held virtually or in shorter formats, doesn’t diminish Biden’s leadership.Still, the report reveals an administration that carefully curated Biden’s image. The tight control extended to Biden’s re-election campaign in 2024, with aides withholding direct survey results from him. As Biden’s approval ratings dipped, staffers managed his exposure to the media, fearing that negative coverage could harm his prospects.Biden’s re-election campaign faced additional scrutiny as some worried that the first lady, Jill Biden, was overshadowing her husband. At times, staff even intervened to prevent Jill Biden from outshining the president, revealing internal concerns about how the media might portray the Bidens.Despite the concerns over Biden’s cognitive state, Bates stressed that the president’s accomplishments were significant. ""President Biden has earned the most accomplished record of any modern commander-in-chief,"" he asserted, citing the administration’s economic achievements and efforts to rebuild the middle class.","White House aides carefully managed Biden's schedule and limited interactions due to concerns over his mental and physical stamina.

Fuentes’ response to the threat

What’s next for Fuentes?

Far-right streamer and political influencer Nick Fuentes claimed that an assassination attempt was made on his life at his residence in Berwyn, Illinois, on Wednesday night. The dramatic incident, which saw police kill the alleged assailant, has raised new questions about Fuentes' controversial influence and online presence.At around 11:40 pm local time, Berwyn police responded to a call about a person with a gun near Fuentes' home. Police later identified the suspect as 24-year-old John R. Lyons of Westchester, Illinois, who had reportedly fled into a nearby house, killed two dogs, and then made his way onto Fuentes' block. Officers confronted Lyons, who allegedly shot at them after ignoring verbal commands to stop. In response, police returned fire, fatally wounding Lyons.In the aftermath of the attempted attack, Fuentes took to social media, sharing footage from his Ring doorbell camera. The video showed a man, wearing a helmet and carrying a firearm and a crossbow, approaching Fuentes' home. In his post on X (formerly Twitter), Fuentes described the terrifying moment:""The killer parked his car in front of my house and approached my door with his pistol drawn and what appears to be a crossbow. I was livestreaming at the time. He rings the doorbell, tries the doorknob and yells, ‘Yo Nick!’""Despite Fuentes' claims, police have yet to confirm whether he was specifically targeted during the incident. However, Fuentes insisted that the man was a “would-be assassin” and stated, ""Last night an armed killer made an attempt on my life at my home, which was recently doxed on this platform. The gunman carried a pistol, crossbow, and incendiary devices. I believe he intended to kill me. He is now dead. I am okay!”Fuentes shared that police had informed him the alleged assailant was involved in a triple homicide earlier in the evening in Mahomet, Illinois. The victims, identified as Sara Mason, 26, and Janis L. Mason, 61, both died from gunshot wounds, while Caleb M. Mason, 23, succumbed to injuries at a local hospital. The motive for these killings remains unclear, and investigations are ongoing by the Champaign County Coroner's Office, Mahomet Police Department, and Illinois State Police.The confrontation between Lyons and police in Berwyn could have had a far worse outcome. ""While heartbreaking, it could have been so unimaginably worse. God have mercy,"" Fuentes wrote, referring to the death of his neighbor's two dogs at the hands of the alleged assailant.In a separate post, Fuentes expressed gratitude for his survival, writing, “I am grateful to God that I am still alive today.” He also thanked police for their swift response, which led to the assailant's death.The assassination attempt came just one day before Fuentes was scheduled to appear in court on a misdemeanor battery charge. Fuentes, known for his controversial far-right views and online presence, faces allegations of pepper-spraying a woman, Marla Rose, at his home on November 10. Rose had confronted Fuentes after he posted a controversial message online. Fuentes was later charged with battery and is set to appear in court on December 19.This legal issue is just one chapter in Fuentes’ history of controversial actions. He previously gained attention for attending a 2022 dinner with former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and for his participation in the 2017 Charlottesville rally. He has also been banned from several social media platforms due to his extreme views.Following the attempted attack, Fuentes shared his plans to secure his safety, acknowledging the need for heightened protection. ""If anybody would like to contribute to defray the cost ($13,000/week) of private security and rebuilding my studio, here is a donation link. I can only accept cryptocurrency because I am banned from banking services and CC processing. Thank you,” Fuentes said.He also expressed the challenges of continuing his life while facing such threats: “I will now have to uproot my life and relocate. While I can handle whatever comes to my front door, it is irresponsible to expect my neighbors with young families to share that burden.”The police investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and authorities have yet to confirm the full details surrounding Lyons' motives. As for Fuentes, the incident has further polarized opinions about his presence in far-right media, with his claims of being a target of violence further escalating his already contentious public persona.The attempt on his life, combined with his ongoing legal battles and contentious rhetoric, underscores the growing tensions within the far-right sphere and the consequences of fueling extreme political discourse. As Fuentes continues to advocate for his views, questions remain about the risks of his public profile, especially as he faces increased threats from both sides of the political spectrum.","Far-right streamer Nick Fuentes claims an assassination attempt was made on his life at his residence in Berwyn, Illinois, on Wednesday night.

Who is Dominique Pelicot? Man who became one of worst sexual predators in French history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-dominique-pelicot-man-who-became-one-of-worst-sexual-predators-in-french-history/articleshow/116464531.cms,"Also Read:

Who is Dominique Pelicot?

How did he use online website?



What are the old cases on Dominique



What did the various defendants say



Gisèle chose to reveal publicly



Dominique testified: 'In every man, there is a demon'



'That's their problem. Not mine'



Judges in the French city of Avignon on Thursday sentenced Dominique Pelicot , the ex-husband of Gisèle Pelicot, to the maximum 20 years in prison. Dominique was convicted of drugging and raping his wife in a mass rape trial involving 51 men. He has been described as ""one of the worst sexual predators"" in recent French history.The trial has brought widespread attention to the case and transformed a 72-year-old victim, Gisèle Pelicot into a symbol of resilience and feminist advocacy.The trial, lasting four months, involves 50 additional defendants aged 26 to 74, representing various professions.Dominique Pelicot led a chilling double life, outwardly appearing as a devoted husband while secretly orchestrating horrific crimes. During the day, he accompanied his wife to medical appointments for symptoms he himself was causing.Over nine years, from 2011 to 2020, the 72-year-old retired electrician drugged his unsuspecting wife by lacing her food and drinks with crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medications. While she lay unconscious, he invited dozens of men he had met online to their home to sexually assault her.Dominique's offences extended beyond his wife. He also hid cameras to capture images of his daughters-in-law in private spaces within his house, including one who was expecting twins. These images were distributed online.Police also recovered deleted photographs from his computer showing his daughter, Caroline , asleep in bed wearing unfamiliar undergarments with lights on. She has expressed certainty about being drugged and sexually assaulted by him.According to the New York Times, he acknowledged feeling remorseful after drugging his wife, Gisèle, stating that: ""The next day was terrible, because I saw what a bad state she was in,"" while adding, ""but I won't complain today, because that would be indecent. She is the one suffering, not me.""Dominique's restraint, his lawyer suggested began to unravel in 2011 when he connected with other men on a notorious, unmoderated website. The site, which was shut down last June after generating over 23,000 police cases in France between 2021 and 2024, became a breeding ground for his growing depravity.Even after his arrest in September 2020 for filming up women's skirts in a grocery store—an incident that led police to seize devices filled with incriminating evidence—Dominique persisted.Following his release, he resumed bringing men to his home to participate in raping his near-comatose wife. This continued until his second arrest two months later, based on video evidence of the assaults found on his electronics.While in jail, Dominique's DNA was linked to a 1999 cold case of attempted rape in the Paris region. During a police interrogation, he admitted to the crime, and the transcript was read aloud in court.According to the records, Dominique lured a 19-year-old real estate agent into a building under the pretense of buying it. He pinned her to the ground, tied her wrists with rope, and used ether to incapacitate her. However, the drug’s effects wore off quickly, and the woman managed to escape.Dominique is also the prime suspect in another cold case from 1991 involving a young female real estate agent who was raped and murdered. She was drugged with ether while showing an apartment in Paris to an unidentified client. In court this month, Pelicot denied any involvement in the 1991 case.Among numerous defendants who entered guilty pleas in the trial, he stands as one. The majority of accused individuals refute rape allegations, claiming their participation in what they believed was a consensual arrangement involving swingers.Various defendants provided different explanations: some believed Gisèle was merely reserved or would regain consciousness, whilst others claimed ignorance of her drugged state.According to The Guardian, several accused told investigators that it wasn't rape if Gisèle's husband had consented for her. ""He can do what he likes; it’s his wife,"" one said.One individual described experiencing a peculiar sensation where his physical self felt separated from his mental faculties.""I am a rapist like many in this room. They knew everything, all of it,"" he said the initial days of the trial.""I am just as responsible as them,"" Dominique said months later, on his last day of testimony and cross-examination, the New York Times reported. ""Without me, they wouldn't be here. And without them, I wouldn't be here,"" he added.Gisèle Pelicot arrives at the courthouse wearing sunglasses shortly before nine o'clock, maintaining near-perfect attendance throughout the proceedings, BBC reported.Breaking from convention, she chose to reveal her identity publicly, remaining steadfast in her stance. ""I want all women who have been raped to say: Madame Pelicot did it, I can too.""""She keeps repeating, 'I am normal,' she does not want to be considered as an icon,"" her solicitor Stéphane Babonneau told the BBC's Emma Barnett .""Women generally have a strength in them that they can't even imagine and that they have to trust themselves. That's her message,"" Babonneau added.Experts in court attributed his doings to a traumatic upbringing, as detailed by Dominique and his half-sister, Ginette Pelicot , who recounted the violent environment of their childhood home.Throughout weeks of testimony, Dominique repeatedly referenced a memory witnessing what he described as his father raping and humiliating his mother—a moment that left an indelible mark on his psyche.""In every man, there is a demon,"" Dominique testified. Mine came from my childhood,"" he added.During the proceedings, his legal representative, Béatrice Zavarro, presented evidence suggesting that Pelicot had endured emotional wounds from various traumatic experiences.Whilst denying drugging his daughter Caroline, Dominique failed to provide a credible explanation for possessing the photographs. He also denied capturing the images.David, his son, voiced concerns about his own child potentially being subjected to Dominique's misconduct. Dominique consistently maintains he never sexually abused any of his children or grandchildren.When Antoine Camus, representing Gisèle Pelicot and their children, stated the children required healing and reconstruction, adding ""only you can liberate them from this nightmare.""Dominique Pelicot responded dismissively, ""That's their problem. Not mine.""","Dominique Pelicot was convicted of drugging and raping his wife in a mass rape trial involving 51 men.

Hundreds of Syrians took to the streets of central Damascus on Thursday, calling for democracy and equality after Islamist rebels toppled president Bashar al-Assad a week ago.Demonstrators in Ummayad square, including both men and women, voiced their demands with chants like ""We want a democracy, not a religious state"" and ""Free, civil Syria."" Protesters carried placards such as ""No free nation without free women.""A week ago, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a rebel group with roots in Al-qaeda, seized control of the capital in a swift offensive. HTS ousted Assad on December 8, marking the end of his family’s 50-year authoritarian rule. The rebel group has since established a transitional leadership, aiming to govern until March 1.While the group has reassured Syria’s diverse religious and ethnic minorities of their safety, concerns remain. Many Syrians worry about potential policies that could marginalise minorities, exclude women from public life, and push for stricter religious governance.Under Assad's anti-Islamist rule, women were actively involved in Syria's political, social, and economic life, with parliamentary and ministerial representation sometimes ranging between 20 percent and 30 percent, according to AFP reports.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres expressed cautious optimism, calling Assad's fall a ""flame of hope"" amidst the region’s challenges. ""That flame must not be extinguished,"" he warned, acknowledging the significant hurdles ahead in stabilising the nation and ensuring equal rights for all its citizens.Amidst the demonstration, a few armed HTS fighters, some of them masked, were also seen patrolling the area.","Demonstrators in Ummayad square, including both men and women, voiced their demands.

The purpose behind the construction of Stonehenge, a monument dating back roughly 5,000 years, has long puzzled historians and archaeologists. However, a new study may have shed light on its origins, suggesting it served as a symbol of unity among the peoples of ancient Britain , according to the news outletResearchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University claim that Stonehenge was created to represent the unification of communities from different regions of Britain. They claim that people from Scotland and Wales contributed local stones to the construction as a gesture of goodwill.The study, published in, highlights Stonehenge as an early example of a political and symbolic effort to unify diverse communities. The researchers describe the monument as a ""monumental expression of unity between people, land, ancestors, and the heavens.""In the paper, the researchers argue that Stonehenge’s long-distance links support the theory that the Neolithic monument had a unifying purpose in ancient Britain, alongside its symbolic value.""The fact that all of its stones originated from distant regions, making it unique among over 900 stone circles in Britain, suggests that the stone circle may have had a political as well as a religious purpose,"" said lead author Professor Mike Parker Pearson from UCL's Institute of Archaeology.""[It was] a monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos.""The study posits that the Scottish and Welsh contributions symbolized alliances and shared efforts, embodying a sacred or political unity . Additionally, similarities in architectural styles between northern Scotland and the Stonehenge region suggest strong connections between these areas.""[This was] perhaps to cement an alliance or to take part in the extraordinary long-distance collaboration that building Stonehenge represented and embodied,"" the authors added.Evidence shows that many of the individuals buried at Stonehenge lived outside Salisbury Plain, indicating it was a site that drew people from across Britain.The study aligns with earlier research suggesting Stonehenge was used for rituals and ceremonies tied to the solstices. During the winter solstice, the setting sun aligns with the Altar Stone, further emphasizing its celestial significance.Theories about Stonehenge's purpose have ranged from its use as a solar calendar to a center for healing, ancestor worship, or burial rites. Despite ongoing debates, this new research strengthens the idea that Stonehenge was a profound symbol of unity and collaboration among ancient British communities.",A new study suggests Stonehenge was created to represent the unification of communities from different regions of Britain.

Chhattishgarh 'crossfire' casualty: Injured girl's father says police shot her,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattishgarh-crossfire-casualty-injured-girls-father-says-police-shot-her/articleshow/116487724.cms,"RAIPUR: The father of the 16-year-old girl, who was shot and injured during an encounter between security forces and Maoists in Abujhmarh on Dec 12, says it’s a police bullet that’s lodged in her throat. She may have to live with the bullet — and pain — all her life.Speaking to reporters Raipur in Gondi dialect, the girl’s father alleged that she was wounded in police firing . “There are no Naxalites there, only police from Bhairamgarh? We saw the bullet hitting my child when she was playing,” he is heard saying.On Wednesday, Bastar Range IG P Sundarraj had described her and the three other minors injured in the encounter as “victims of Naxal violence”.“When the encounter broke out, Maoists used villagers as human shields, causing injury to four.Maoists have returned to their old cruel means of using children and villagers as human shields in order to protect senior cadres. Primafacie, it appears they used children as shields in a desperate attempt to protect Odisha State Committee cadre Kartick,” he said.The 16-year-old girl was brought to Dau Kalyan Singh (DKS) Hospital in Raipur two days ago. It’s been an agonising week since she was injured, but the bullet is still lodged in her throat.Doctors are discussing if they should let the bullet remain or remove it.She is in pain and has swelling near her jaws, but her vital parameters have been stabilised, and she’s able to talk, walk and eveneat, doctors at DKS told TOI.“The bullet is lodged near the mandible after entering from the back of the neck. While the outer neck injury is being treated and is healing, we performed a CT scan and a few other tests to discuss the next line of treatment for the bullet.A team of doctors is discussing which organs would get affected if the bullet is extracted and if leaving it as it is would be better,” Dr Rajiv Sahu, HOD neurosurgery department, told TOI.The girl is “neurologically intact”, as she’s responding well and is performing her daily chores normally, the doctor said.The doctors — and the girl — are at a crossroads on the bullet. “We will explain to the family the consequences of both scenarios,” Dr Sahu said.A statement issued by Bastar police said that after the guns fell silent on the day of encounter, security personnel collected Naxal bodies but did not find any injured person. Tribal rights activist contests this.“When security forces can carry the bodies to base, why didn’t they take the in-jured children to hospital? Because, body count will get them rewards but wounded kids won’t. When the forces searched the site, they found only dead bodies and none of the injured?” Sori asked.She and some local social workers had gone to the remote village on Saturday and brought the three children in a boat to Bhairamgarh and then got them admitted to Dantewada and Jagdalpur hospitals, from where the girl was shifted to Raipur by the administration.The three other injured children are being treated at Bhairamgarh and Dantewada hospitals and their condition is stated to be stable. The IG said govt is taking care of their medical expenses.Opposition Congress demands answers from govt. Former chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said Congress will bring an adjournment motion in the House on Friday, the last day of the winter session of assembly, to discuss law and order, and the Abujhmarh encounter.“It’s a very serious issue where women, children and civilians are getting killed in Bastar,” Baghel said.","The 16-year-old girl was shot and injured during an encounter between security forces and Maoists in Abujhmarh on Dec 12.

"Preserving unity our duty, it’s what makes us complete: CM Mamata Banerjee at Christmas fest opening",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/preserving-unity-our-duty-its-what-makes-us-complete-cm-mamata-banerjee-at-christmas-fest-opening/articleshow/116487837.cms,"KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday spoke on the importance of religious harmony and unity, saying it was our duty to protect it, as that was what made us complete human beings.Banerjee was speaking on the premises of St Xavier’s College (Autonomous) on Park Street while inaugurating the annual Christmas Festival at Allen Park. Before her, Fr Felix Raj, the vice-chancellor of St Xavier’s University, lauded Bengal for being an example of harmony at a time when minorities were facing harassment at several places in the country.The CM used the metaphor of a person who does not have all of his or her limbs to try and illustrate her point. “There might be multiple religions. Some may be Hindus, Christians or Muslims, but we are complete only when we have everything,” she said. “It cannot be acceptable if someone says there is just one faith. Everybody from Jesus to Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Rabindranath have stressed religious harmony. That is how we can be complete. No one can survive without peace and unity,” she added.Before Banerjee’s address, Fr Raj, during his address, said: “Yesterday was Minorities Rights Day. Minorities today are in danger. Protection of minorities is a prerequisite of any democracy. At a time when several parts of the country are witnessing harassment of some communities, our state remains an example of harmony and diversity.”Archbishop Thomas D’Souza, who was also present, said: “You (Banerjee) have made unity, harmony and peace your motto. We thank you for this.... Love is needed today more than ever as we look into the present world situation. May Jesus shed his light on us and bring peace and joy.”Banerjee said she was “sure” that today’s youth would come together to glorify “our common theme, ‘ unity in diversity ’.... Just as health is wealth and not the other way round, remember this (unity) is our wealth.” The CM referred to Kolkata as India’s “cultural capital” and a “city of harmony”.“I am shocked and stunned by the way Ambedkar has been insulted and belittled. Christmas signifies joy, peace and unity. The Centre has cancelled the Christmas holiday on Dec 25. Our state does not do that and will not do so. We respect all religions. We have declared holidays here, whether it is Eid, Christmas, Chhath, the birthday of Guru Nanak Ji or Guru Ravidas,” the CM said.Banerjee also recalled her interactions with Mother Teresa and said she felt honoured to have represented the state at the Vatican in Sept 2016, during Mother Teresa’s canonisation.The CM said the Christmas Festival would run from Dec 19 to 30. “On Dec 24 and 25, traffic will be controlled on Park Street, when it will be turned into ‘Walk Street’,” she said. She also announced the renaming of Short Street to St Francis Xavier Sarani.","Banerjee was speaking on the premises of St Xavier’s College (Autonomous) on Park Street.

Pakistan developing missiles that could eventually hit US: Official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pakistan-developing-missiles-that-could-eventually-hit-us-official/articleshow/116486559.cms,"White House flags Pakistan's missile advances

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

She described her relationship with her parents as ""extremely difficult"" as she spoke about her loneliness.Court documents now reveal that her parents divorced 10 years ago leading to custody chaos which might have made Natalie's life difficult.According to court documents, Rupnow was placed in the primary care of her mother Mellissa Rupnow following their divorce in 2014. For the next eight years, the parents fought over the custody which also involved a remarriage and a second divorce, and in 2022, the primary custody of Rupnow was earned by the father, Jeffrey Rupnow.The parents got remarried in 2017, according to one document which then asked to set child support to zero and adjust the custody of Nataliue to equal shared placement. The couple filed for a second divorce in 2021 and agreed to a shared placement of Natalie. In a mediated agreement filed in July 2022, Natalie's father Jeffrey was granted primary placement of Natalie and the parents agreed that their goal was to work toward equal placement.A teacher and a student of the school died and six people were injured after Natalie shot up a room filled with study-hall kids before shooting herself. A combination of factors has been blamed for the shooting spree including her very disturbed family life.The cops are also probing an angle of bullying and the exact motive is not yet known. “On the question of bullying, we’re talking to students to understand whether bullying was one of those multiple factors that I mentioned earlier,” Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said adding that the authenticity of the manifesto was yet to be ascertained.“I’ve grown to hate people, and society, it’s truly not my fault though, it never was. but all of you and the world have done to me is pick and tease me, you’ve pushed me into a corner with no help whatsoever,"" the manifesto read.","Natalie 'Samatha' Rupnow, the 15-year-old suspect in the Wisconsin Abundant Life Christian School shooting, called her parents'scum' in the alleged manifesto.

Pakistan slams US missile sanctions as ‘biased’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-us-missile-sanctions-as-biased/articleshow/116480917.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme. Additional sanctions were imposed in Oct on China-based firms for supplying missile-applicable items to Pakistan.",The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi.

The move freezes any US-based assets belonging to the targeted entities and also forbids American citizens or businesses from engaging with them.“In light of the continuing proliferation threat of Pakistan’s long-range missile development, the United States is designating four entities for sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,” a press release by the US Department of State said.The NDC, headquartered in Islamabad, plays a central role in Pakistan’s missile development efforts, according to a State Department factsheet. It has been actively seeking components for the country’s long-range ballistic missile systems, including the SHAHEEN family of missiles, which are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists suggests that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal now consists of approximately 170 warheads. The country conducted its first nuclear test back in 1998, and remains outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.The sanctions also target three private firms—Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, and Rockside Enterprise—accused of helping the NDC acquire equipment for its missile programme.“The United States will continue to act against proliferation and procurement activities that pose a concern,” Miller further added in the release.The Pakistani embassy in Washington is yet to respond to the sanctions.",The U.S. has announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme.

Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

Bangladesh reduces ULFA leader's death sentence in weapons smuggling case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-reduces-ulfa-leaders-death-sentence-in-weapons-smuggling-case/articleshow/116442037.cms,"Representative image/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh high court on Wednesday reduced the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment in a 2004 case involving the attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).The court also acquitted a former junior minister and five others. Baruah, reportedly residing in China, had been sentenced to death in absentia in 2014. His name appears on India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ""most wanted"" list.In 2011, ULFA split into two factions. The pro-talk group, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, chose to return to Assam from ""abroad"" and engage in peace negotiations. In contrast, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Baruah, rejected the idea of negotiations.The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when authorities in Chattogram (then called Chittagong) seized ten truckloads of weapons from the premises of the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. The consignment was reportedly intended to be transported through Bangladesh to ULFA hideouts across the border in India.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, 1,100 submachine guns, 11.41 million bullets, and over 11 lakh rounds of ammunition.The high court bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar commuted Baruah's death sentence to life imprisonment. The bench also acquitted Bangladesh's former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who had earlier received capital punishment.The acquitted individuals include former DGFI (a defence intelligence agency of Bangladesh) director-general retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former industries ministry additional secretary Nurul Amin, and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The weapons were reportedly intended for ULFA and were being moved through a jetty managed by CUFL, a state-run fertilizer plant. Among those previously sentenced to death was Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director and retired brigadier general, who passed away in prison before his appeal could be heard. Nizami, also a former minister, was executed several years ago for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.Babar’s lawyer, Shishir Manir, argued that Babar had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons, and the prosecution failed to present credible evidence or reliable witnesses. Babar was also sentenced in a separate case involving a 2004 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. However, a high court bench acquitted him in that case earlier this month.The arms haul case remained dormant for years during the BNP-led government, where Jamaat-e-Islami was a coalition partner. Reports suggested that police officers involved in the seizure faced harassment, and efforts were made to suppress the investigation. The military-backed interim government in 2008 ordered a re-investigation amid these allegations. The extended probe revealed that officials from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the National Security Intelligence (NSI) oversaw the arms shipment. Chinese firm NORINCO was identified as the manufacturer of the weapons, though investigators could not trace the ship that transported the consignment to Bangladesh.In 2014, a special tribunal in Chattogram convicted 14 people, including Baruah, Babar, and Nizami, sentencing them to death. The court ruled that the consignment was part of an elaborate plan to arm ULFA militants.",Bangladesh high court reduces death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment.

A total of 10 truckloads of weapons were seized in April 2004 despite alleged efforts of certain ""influential quarters"" for its safe passage to United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) hideouts in northeastern India through Chattogram, which was then spelled as 'Chittagong'.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, over 11 lakh ammunition, 1,100 sub machine guns and 11.41 million bullets.The two-member High Court bench commuted the punishment of ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who was sentenced to death after a trial in absentia --- now assumed to be living in China --- and sentenced him to life imprisonment, said a government attorney at the bench.The High Court bench comprising Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar acquitted former state minister for home Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who were handed down capital punishment following the death reference hearing, he added.The five others to escape the gallows are former director general of forces Intelligence (DGFI) retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of a state-run fertilizer plant (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former additional secretary of industries ministry Nurul Amin and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The plant site was said to have been used for trans-shipment of weapons for ULFA.Former chief of Bangladesh 's National Security Intelligence ex-brigadier general Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director as well, was also sentenced to death but he died a normal death in prison as the appeal and death hearing process was underway.Nizami, a former minister in the past Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-Jamaat alliance government, however, was hanged several years ago on charges of crimes against humanity during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War siding with the Pakistani troops while his party was opposed to the country's independence.Babar's lawyer Shishir Manir earlier told the bench that his client had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons and the prosecution could not produce any credible evidence or trustworthy witness in support of the charges brought against him.The former junior minister was also sentenced over a 2004 grenade attack on the now deposed prime minister and the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina and her top party leaders when 24 people were killed and hundreds wounded but another High Court bench acquitted him after death reference hearing on December 1.Earlier on January 30, 2014, a special tribunal in the northeastern port city of Chattogram handed down the death penalty to 14 people, including two former ministers of the past BNP government, two ex-army generals and a top ULFA leader in the arms haul case.The trial or lower court verdict had come nearly a decade after the accidental seizure of 10 truck loads of smuggled-in weapons destined to the ULFA hideouts in northeastern India through Bangladesh territory.The two politicians to get the capital punishment were Babar and Nizami, the former Jamaat ameer and then industries minister in the same cabinet, while ULFA's fugitive military wing chief Barua was one of the convicts to be awarded the death penalty.But the case was shelved for years during the past BNP-led four-party government with Jamaat being the key-ally while police officers who seized the weapons were allegedly exposed to professional harassment.The subsequent military-backed interim regime in 2008 ordered the re-investigation amid allegations that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the then administration to suppress facts to weaken the case.The supplementary chargesheet said the weapons were brought for ULFA under the supervision of some DGFI and NSI officials while the consignment was unloaded at a government jetty in Chittagong to be reloaded in trucks destined for northeastern frontiers.Officials familiar with the investigation said their extended probe found Chinese firm NORINCO to have produced the weapons but they could not identify the ship that carried the illegal consignment to Bangladesh territory.","A Bangladeshi High Court on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Barua to life imprisonment.

DHAKA: The Bangladesh HC scrapped on Tuesday a section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category, reports Ahsan Tasnim. The HC also reinstated the provision for holding referendums on constitutional amendments.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court.The Bangladesh high court scrapped on Tuesday a section of the 15th Amendment Act of the constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that the current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category.Also, in a significant step, the court revived the provision of holding referendums in case of bringing any amendment to the constitution.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court under Article 106 of Bangladesh's constitution. Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure.

The Allegations



'H6'



Yang's denial



Prince Andrew's role



China responds



A Chinese businessman with close ties to Prince Andrew has denied allegations of espionage after being named by British authorities as a suspected Chinese agent.Yang Tengbo , previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.Yang, 50, has been accused by Britain’s home office of working for the United Front Work Department (UFWD), an arm of China’s Communist Party that reportedly builds ties with influential individuals worldwide. Authorities allege Yang engaged in “covert and deceptive activity” on behalf of the UFWD and posed a national security threat .Judges sided with M15, Britain's domestic intelligence, saying that Yang ""represented a risk to national security"" and dismissed his appeal.The SIAC disclosed that in 2021, authorities discovered documents highlighting Yang's close relationship with Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III.In February 2023, Yang was removed from a flight from Beijing to London and subsequently banned from entering the UK. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) upheld the ban last Thursday, bringing his links to Prince Andrew into public view for the first time.The Chinese national, referred as ""H6"" in British espionage and media circles. H6 is believed to be among more than 40,000 operatives linked to the department operating across the globe.Responding to the allegations, Yang insisted he was innocent: “I have done nothing wrong or unlawful, and the concerns raised by the home office against me are ill-founded. The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue.”His lawyer, Guy Vassall-Adams, sidelined the claims and confirmed Yang waived his anonymity to defend his reputation.SIAC’s ruling revealed that evidence from Yang’s phone showed Prince Andrew had authorised him to establish an “international financial initiative” to engage with Chinese investors. However, the ruling provided no details about the purpose of the fund.On Friday, Prince Andrew said he had “ceased all contact” with Yang once concerns about the businessman were brought to his attention. Requests for further comment from the Prince’s office remain unanswered.China's foreign ministry dismissed the accusations, calling them groundless. A spokesperson said, ""China has lways been open and above board and has never engaged in deception or interference. Such speculation is not worth refuting.""","Yang Tengbo, previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.
