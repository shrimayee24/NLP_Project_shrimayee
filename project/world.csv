NEW DELHI: AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday alleged that the Gandhi family has not faced jail in the National Herald case despite what he called clear facts, and claimed there is a wider perception that the Congress has ""compromised"" with the BJP.""Politics of compromise doesn't work. If you think that a compromise will happen behind closed doors and the public won't find out, that's not the case. Everything becomes known. The public isn't foolish,"" Kejriwal said.He added, ""Nowadays, there's talk everywhere. Some say Mayawati has compromised, some say Owaisi has compromised, and now people are saying even Congress has compromised. Recently, while I was talking to people in Goa, they were saying that five of our (AAP's) top leaders were jailed by the BJP. Why hasn't a single Congress leader gone to jail, despite all the noise about the National Herald case?""""I didn’t know what the National Herald is. I read about it on the internet, and it sounds quite serious. Based on the facts, it seems like an open-and-shut case. They fabricated a completely false case to send us to jail. None of the Gandhi family members went to jail,"" he said.Referring to other cases, Kejriwal remarked, ""There was a lot of noise about him (Robert Vadra) during the 2014 elections. They won the elections using his name. Now, no one talks about it. The 2G case was closed, the coal scam was closed, and other cases were closed.There's something going on, and the public isn't naive. People are discussing that there's an alliance between Congress and BJP.""He said AAP would continue to fight without compromise. ""We (Aam Aadmi Party) didn’t come here to form alliances; we came for the country and will continue to fight for it. Never engage in politics of compromise,"" Kejriwal stated.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal called AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal's allegations ""baseless"".Hitting out at Kejriwal, Sibal said, ""Kejriwal ji: When you made allegations against several politicians and others and was dragged to court you apologised!""""Today you made baseless allegations against the Gandhi family (National Herald case).

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy on Thursday said that ""almost all the people who we call ‘antinationals’ are the ones who care"" while those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.""Almost all the people who we call 'antinationals' are the ones who care. And then the people who call themselves great nationalists, I can bet you that 99 per cent of them are dodging taxes, have sent their kids to America, or are doing everything to make sure that what goes on in this country doesn't affect their personal wealth or their whatever bullshit,"" Roy was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.She was speaking at the launch of her memoir. The book is centred on her relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a women’s rights activist who fought the landmark inheritance case for Syrian Christian women in Kerala.Roy said she wrote the memoir after Mary’s death in 2022, describing it as ""born out of the onrush of memories and feelings provoked"" by her mother’s passing. ""I wrote this book because I feel that my mother is someone who deserves to be shared with the world,"" she said, as quoted by PTI.The 63-year-old, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for, said her writing has always come from ""a place of love and caring about something"".""I write when it becomes harder to keep quiet than to write,"" Roy told PTI in an interview. She added, ""People don't understand why one gets so upset? Why do I write? Because it comes from a place of love. It comes from caring about something. Otherwise, why should I bother? Like, why shouldn't I enjoy my Booker Prize or whatever it was.""She said she does not see herself as both a writer and activist. ""It’s a label I find absurd, something like the clunky term sofa-bed,"" she remarked.Roy described writing itself as a risky pursuit. ""The most dangerous place in the history of time has been writing. I've never been under any illusion that it was a safe place. So I'm okay here. Because it's the safety that suffocates me,"" she said.The memoir details her difficult relationship with her mother, who, she recalls, insisted her children address her as “Mrs Roy” like other students at her school in Kerala. “It was almost as though for her (Mary) to shine her light on her students and give them all she had, we — he (the brother) and I (Roy) — had to absorb the darkness,” Roy writes.She added, “She was rough, and that roughness was what put some steel into my spine... So when all those people were around me — protesting and calling me names — I’d just be going like, 'Do you know whose daughter I am?' Like, my needle isn't moving at all.”Over the years, Arundhati Roy has faced cases, protests, and even a day in jail for supporting the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Her bookwas banned in Jammu and Kashmir this August along with 24 other titles for allegedly promoting ""false narrative and secessionism"".","Arundhati Roy says those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.

Five people were rescued with the help of boats, even as searches continued for the missing minor late into Wednesday night.The nine were all relatives and members of Gadri community from Chittorgarh’s Kanakheda village. They were returning from a visit to Sawai Bhoj temple in neighbouring Bhilwara district, and relied on Google Maps for an alternative route as police had erected barricades on roads leading to flooded areas.The app led them to the closed Somi-Uprera bridge over Banas river, which was in spate due to heavy rains that had battered the region for the past three to four days.

'Talks Are On With...': Rahul’s Wedding Remark After Tejashwi’s Tip Sparks Political Banter In Bihar

Poll Do you believe the government's response to the SSC protests was justified? Yes, they acted appropriately No, it was excessive

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He accused the Modi government of ignoring the concerns of the youth, alleging it had come to power by “stealing votes. ”In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said the lathicharge on SSC aspirants and teachers peacefully protesting at Ramlila Maidan was “not just shameful, but the hallmark of a cowardly government.”The protest, held on Sunday, saw the participation of several SSC candidates and their trainers, who were demanding transparency and better conduct of recruitment examinations. The SSC exams have faced repeated complaints of abrupt cancellations, server crashes, unresponsive systems and exam centres located as far as 500 kilometres from candidates’ homes.“The youth had only demanded their rights — employment and justice. What did they get? Lathis,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the government first manipulated elections to secure votes, then allowed irregularities in examinations, followed by failures in providing jobs and ultimately sought to suppress citizens’ rights and voices.The Congress leader further said the government does not prioritise the demands of youth, farmers, the poor, Dalits and minorities, as it does not depend on their votes. He urged people not to be afraid but to stand firm and fight back.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also condemned the alleged police action, claiming the Modi government had made it a “habit” to jeopardise the future of the youth.“Stealing the future of the country’s youth has become a habit of the Modi government. The brutal lathi-charge by the Modi government’s puppet police on students protesting against rigging in SSC exams at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan is highly condemnable,” Kharge said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too criticised the government, calling the use of force on protesting students “inhuman and shameful.”In her post on X, she said, “The youth of the entire country are troubled by rigging in every exam, scams in every recruitment and paper leaks. The corruption in the recruitment process and exams under the BJP rule is ruining the future of the youth.”Denying the allegations, a senior Delhi Police officer said around 1,500 protestors had gathered at the site, and about 100 refused to leave after the permitted time despite repeated requests.“Out of those who were not leaving, 44 protestors were detained. There was no lathi-charge,” the officer clarified.The SSC is a statutory body responsible for conducting recruitment examinations for various posts across ministries, departments and other government organisations.The Phase 13 exam, held between July 24 and August 1 at 194 centres in 142 cities, faced multiple disruptions. Approximately five lakh candidates appeared for the examination during this period.These issues sparked widespread protests across Delhi last week, drawing thousands of aspirants to the streets and triggering a strong backlash on social media.",Rahul Gandhi hits out at the Centre over the alleged lathicharge on Staff Selection Commission (SSC) aspirants and trainers protesting at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan.

Around 20 colleges, including Jesus and Mary College in Chanakyapuri, also received the threats, police said.Authorities immediately launched a coordinated security operation, with Delhi Police’s bomb disposal squads and dog squads conducting thorough checks. “The threats have been assessed and declared as hoaxes,” a senior police official said.“We are treating the matter seriously and investigations are underway to trace the origin of the emails.” Police suspect the sender may have used a VPN.The incident comes amid a series of similar hoax threats reported in schools across the capital in recent weeks.

I am not sending any child inside the building as a precautionary measure.”Earlier this month, over 50 schools in Delhi-NCR also received bomb threats from a group identifying itself as Terrorisers 111.

MUMBAI: At least 17 people have been killed after a residential building collapsed in Virar East, on the outskirts of Mumbai, late on Tuesday night.Officials said one section of Ramabai Apartment came crashing down during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, trapping several residents.The collapse occurred as a birthday party was under way on the fourth floor, according to locals.Rescue teams from the fire brigade, police, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and ambulance services were deployed to the site.Operations to search for survivors and recover bodies continued into Wednesday.In the wake of the tragedy, Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC) announced a landmark decision to recognise flat owners of the collapsed building as having “other rights” (Itar Hakk) in property records.Municipal commissioner Manoj Suryavanshi said the move would ensure that residents’ names are added to land documents alongside the landowners, giving them legal standing in property-related decisions.“We will explore the legalities to pass a resolution adding their names in land documents so that their rights are maintained,” he said, adding that the civic body would push for maximum assistance from both VVCMC and the state government.Deputy municipal commissioner Deepak Sawant said proof of residence certificates would be issued soon to the affected families and steps taken to formalise their claims in official property records.The Jovil family was celebrating the first birthday of their daughter when the slab collapsed. The one-year-old, Utkarsha Omkar Jovil, died during treatment. Her mother, 23-year-old Aarohi, was killed instantly in the collapse.The father, 25-year-old Omkar, is still missing and believed to be under the debris, while some visiting relatives are also feared trapped.Two NDRF teams — one from Mumbai and another from Palghar — were deployed to the site. “When we arrived around midnight, we removed four from the debris, out of which one small girl died. So far, we have removed around 11 from the debris and continue to search for more,” said Pramod Singh, Deputy Commander, NDRF.Palghar Collector Indurani Jakhar confirmed that 11 people had been rescued by morning, two of whom later died. Heavy machinery was brought in only after evacuating adjoining structures, as manual clearing was carried out through the night to avoid further damage. Nearby chawls and neighbouring buildings have been evacuated as a precaution.Locals have told officials that at least 10 more people could still be trapped.Residents said the building, constructed illegally in 2012–13, had long been declared unsafe. Notices were served by the Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC), but residents allege the developer ignored them.Local resident Tukaram Shinde, who had lived in Ramabai Apartment for 13 years, said: “The developer received three notices from the civic body, but nothing was done.Last week even a staircase collapsed and a social worker warned the builder that the structure could fall. But it was ignored.”Residents had been pushing for redevelopment but claimed both the landowner and the developer resisted due to costs. Many escaped the collapse with nothing but the clothes they were wearing.Virar police confirmed that they have arrested Nittal Gopinath Sane, 47, owner of Sai Dutta Builders and Developers, who constructed the building.He has been booked under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966 and Section 105 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).“We have arrested Nittal Sane and will produce him before Vasai court on Thursday,” said Senior PI Lalu Ture of Virar police station.The delayed action — more than a decade after the illegal structure was built — has triggered anger. Lawyer and Shiv Sena leader Anil Chavan questioned why the VVCMC waited until tragedy struck to act. He demanded that the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act be invoked against such developers so their assets can be seized and sold, with proceeds returned to affected buyers.“Will the civic body wait for other buildings to collapse before booking illegal builders? When will residents finally get safe homes — or compensation to buy one?” he asked.The collapse has reignited concerns about dozens of other unsafe and illegally constructed buildings in Vasai-Virar. Civic negligence, delayed enforcement, and unregulated urban growth have left thousands of families living in precarious structures — and fearing they could be the next victims.","At least 17 people have been killed after a residential building collapsed in Virar East, on the outskirts of Mumbai, late on Tuesday night.

Microsoft statement on firing of the two employees

What are protesters demands

Two Microsoft employees were terminated on Wednesday, August 27, after their participation in a sit-in at the company president's office, a protest against the tech giant's business ties to Israel. The employees, Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli, were reportedly among seven protesters who occupied the office of Microsoft President Brad Smith on Tuesday. According to the activist group No Azure for Apartheid , Hattle and Fameli received voicemails informing them of their termination. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the dismissals, citing ""serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct"" related to ""the break-in at the executive offices.""The other five protesters arrested during the sit-in were identified as former Microsoft workers or individuals unaffiliated with the company.“Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct. The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested. These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters.”The protest group No Azure for Apartheid has demanded that Microsoft sever its ties with Israel and provide reparations to Palestinians. The group's name references Microsoft's Azure cloud software, which a joint media investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call reported is used by an Israeli military surveillance agency. The investigation claimed the agency utilized Azure to store recordings of phone calls made by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and for the broader surveillance of Palestinians.""We are here because Microsoft continues to provide Israel with the tools it needs to commit genocide while gaslighting and misdirecting its own workers about this reality,"" Hattle said in a statement.In response to the media investigation, Microsoft announced this month that it had hired the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to conduct a review.Two employees terminated in April due to similar protestsThe firings of Hattle and Fameli follow a similar incident in April when two other Microsoft employees were also terminated after a pro-Palestinian protest interrupted a company event. The latest firings highlight a growing trend of employee activism within the company and come amid widespread protests at corporations and universities over their connections to Israel.Microsoft President Brad Smith addressed the protests on Tuesday, stating, ""we respect the freedom of expression that everyone in this country enjoys as long as they do it lawfully.""","Two Microsoft employees were terminated on Wednesday, August 27, after their participation in a sit-in at the company president's office.

Japan has mobilised its military in the country’s mountainous north as communities grapple with a surge in bear attacks, with local authorities pointing to shifting food patterns driven by climate change as a possible factor. The self-defense forces (SDF) were deployed Wednesday to Kazuno, a small town in Akita Prefecture, after officials warned that residents faced daily threats from bears foraging near homes.According to Japan’s ministry of the environment, more than 100 bear attacks have been reported since April, leaving a record 12 people dead. Two-thirds of these fatalities occurred in Akita and nearby Iwate Prefecture. Bear sightings in Akita have risen six-fold this year, reaching over 8,000, prompting the prefectural governor to request military assistance.In Kazuno, soldiers arrived in trucks and jeeps, equipped with body armour and large maps, to help transport, set, and inspect steel-barred traps. Trained hunters will carry out the culling. Mayor Shinji Sasamoto said, “The townspeople feel the danger every day… It has affected how people live their lives, forcing them to stop going out or cancel events.”Experts point to a combination of factors behind the surge.Rising bear populations, climate change-induced shortages of natural forest food, and rural depopulation have all contributed to increased human-bear encounters.“Last year there was an abundance of food in the mountains, and many cubs were born. This year, the food supply has run out,” said Yasuhiro Kitakata, head of Kazuno’s bear department.Recent attacks have occurred in unusual places: customers inside a supermarket were assaulted, a tourist was jumped at a bus stop near a UNESCO world heritage site, and a hot spring resort worker was injured. Schools in affected areas have temporarily closed as a precaution. Bear attacks typically peak in October and November, as animals forage intensively ahead of winter hibernation.The SDF operation in Kazuno, a town of roughly 30,000 known for its hot springs and apple orchards, will continue through November and expand to Odate and Kitaakita. Tokyo is also planning a broader emergency package, including recruiting more licensed hunters and relaxing gun rules to make it easier to control bear populations in urban areas. Deputy chief cabinet secretary Kei Sato said, “As bears continue to enter populated areas in many regions and injuries from bear attacks increase daily, we absolutely cannot afford to put off bear countermeasures. ”Analysts warn that climate change may make such incidents more frequent, as rising temperatures and shifting seasonal food patterns push wildlife closer to human settlements. Japan’s unusual military deployment highlights the growing challenge of coexisting with wildlife in an era of environmental change.","Japan has mobilised its military in the country’s mountainous north as communities grapple with a surge in bear attacks. More than 100 bear attacks have been reported since April, leaving a record 12 people dead. Bear sightings in Akita have risen six-fold this year, reaching over 8,000.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125114086,imgsize-918621,width-400,resizemode-4/bear-attack-in-japan-agencies.jpg"
NYC mayoral election: Trump's foe Zohran Mamdani wins high-stake battle; becomes first Muslim mayor of New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyc-mayoral-election-trumps-nemesis-zohran-mamdani-wins-high-stake-battle-becomes-first-muslim-mayor-of-new-york/articleshow/125100394.cms,"HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Trump vs Mamdani





US President Donald Trump 's political foe Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday won the New York City mayoral election, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.34-year-old Mamdani will be New York City's youngest and first Muslim mayor. He will replace Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his re-election bid in September but remained on the ballot.A state assembly member from Queens, Mamdani had entered the contest a year ago as little more than a protest candidate with a thin résumé and virtually no citywide profile.Turnout surged past 2 million voters, the highest level of participation in one of the city's mayoral elections since 1969.Meanwhile, Trump shrugged off Mamdani's victory claiming that US government shutdown was one of the reasons why Republicans lost the polls.Citing pollsters, Trump said ,""Trump wasn’t on the ballot, and shutdown, were the two reasons that Republicans lost elections tonight.""The municipal election turned into a direct fight between Trump and Mamdani. Trump has repeatedly referred to Mamdani as a “Communist lunatic” and a “disaster waiting to happen.” Mamdani, for his part, told The Good Liars in a recent interview that he would “work with the president for the sake of New Yorkers” but “not be cowed.”“If you want to make life more difficult for New Yorkers,” he said, “then I’ll be there to fight you. ”Trump also urged voters to back Cuomo to block Mamdani’s victory. “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” Trump wrote. “You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job.” He warned that if Mamdani wins, federal funds to New York could be at risk.Trump also said that he will cut federal funding to New York if Mamdani wins the election. He also endorsed former New York State governor Andrew Cuomo for the top city post.""If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!"" Trump wrote in a post.New York City, spanning Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island — is home to over 8 million people and stands as one of the world’s most influential urban centres. Its cultural and economic reach extends far beyond the United States, making it a global capital of finance, technology, and the arts.The mayor’s role is therefore of immense importance. With an annual budget of around $116 billion, the mayor oversees services from policing to education in a city visited by 65 million people a year.The position carries both domestic and global weight, with previous mayors using it as a platform for presidential ambitions.The city also leads in artificial intelligence, hosting over 2,000 AI startups and a skilled workforce of 40,000.","34-year-old Mamdani will be New York City's youngest and first Muslim mayor.

Virginia elections: Democrat Abigail Spanberger wins race; makes history as the state's first woman governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/virginia-elections-democrat-abigail-spanberger-wins-race-makes-history-as-the-states-first-woman-governor/articleshow/125099759.cms,"Abigail Spanberger (AP)

Indian origin Democrat Ghazala Hashmi elected Lt governor







Democrat Abigail Spanberger has become the governor of Virginia, making history as the first woman to lead the state after reclaiming the governor’s mansion from Republicans on Tuesday.The former congresswoman and ex-CIA officer defeated Virginia’s Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, as reported by CBS News.The Virginia race drew national attention, seen by many as a referendum on US President Donald Trump. While Trump made significant gains in the state during the 2020 election, his new term has brought economic strain for many Virginians.Virginia has trended more Democratic in recent years, fueled by growth in Washington, DC’s suburbs. However, Democrats lost some ground last year as Trump increased his statewide vote share from 44 percent in 2020 to 46.1 percent in 2024.Spanberger focused on the economic fallout from Trump’s federal spending cuts, which hurt jobs in Virginia, and campaigned on making life more affordable.In the final weeks, Spanberger campaigned alongside prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.Earle-Sears leaned on the backing of outgoing Republican governor Glenn Youngkin, promoting his economic record throughout her campaign.However, the Republican candidate did not receive a direct endorsement from Trump, despite his “complete and total endorsement” of GOP nominees in Virginia’s attorney general race and New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.Trump expressed some support for Earle-Sears, though he did not mention her by name.Northern Virginia, home to many federal workers, has been hit by workforce cuts and the government shutdown.Virginia was one of two states, along with New Jersey, voting for governor on Tuesday. Voters also chose a new mayor in New York City, while Californians decided on a new congressional map aimed at helping Democrats gain up to five additional US House seats in next year’s midterm elections, as reported by AP.Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won Virginia’s lieutenant governor race on Tuesday, defeating Republican John Reid. She becomes the first Indian American and the first Muslim to hold statewide office in Virginia.Hashmi currently serves as a state senator representing a district south of Richmond. Before entering politics, she was a college professor in Virginia.She began her political career in 2019 by winning a Republican-held state Senate seat and later secured victory in a crowded Democratic primary for lieutenant governor in June, as reported by AP.","Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears to become the first woman to lead Virginia.

Bengaluru Doctor Arrested For Allegedly Killing Wife With Anesthesia Overdose Months After Wedding





BENGALURU: Desperately in need of money, a mason and his wife killed their owner, a 65-year-old woman, at her residence on the ground floor of a two-storey building in Uttarahalli, south Bengaluru, on Tuesday. The duo tried to sell her 30gm mangalasutra to overcome financial difficulties, police said.The couple — Prasad Srisaila Makai, 26, and Sakshi, 23, an employee of a jewellery shop, and married for one and a half years — was arrested within a day of the murder. Police said their suspicious behaviour and a missing small pillow strengthened their doubts about the couple's possible involvement in the murder. They rented out accommodation six months ago.The deceased, Shrilakshmi, was talking to her sister on phone when the couple entered her house on the pretext of checking out TV as they were planning to buy one.As Shrilakshmi was on a long call, the couple spent some time watching TV. After the call, they assaulted and strangled her to death and robbed the gold chain. They used the pillow to muffle her cries, police said.The miscreants had not taken the owner's finger ring, a pair of earrings, and nosering.Police took the couple into custody on Tuesday and interrogated them on Wednesday. They confessed to the crime. The gold chain has since been recovered.Earlier in the day, when Shrilakshmi didn't answer his repeated calls from 2.15pm, husband Ashwath Narayana, 70, an employee of an incense stick factory, got worried and called their first-floor neighbours and a nephew. He rushed home by 6.30pm after learning that his wife was found lying motionless on the floor.Ashwath noticed injuries on her neck, lips, and face. She was dead, and her gold mangalya chain was missing. He suspected the tenant-couple behind the murder. Based on his complaint, Subramanyapura police registered a case for murder, robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.Police shifted the body for post-mortem on Tuesday night.","Prasad Srisaila Makai, 26, and Sakshi, 23, entered Shri- lakshmi’s house on the pretext of checking out her TV set as they were planning to buy one.

Shocking Video: UPS Cargo Plane Explodes After Takeoff In Louisville | FAA, NTSB Probe Deadly Crash





An engine on the UPS cargo jet that crashed in Louisville, Kentucky, this week reportedly got detached moments after takeoff. The plane’s left wing also caught fire before it went down, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday.At least 12 people were killed in the crash, officials said Wednesday. A coroner was at the scene, but the condition of some bodies could make identifying the victims difficult, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear was quoted as saying by the NYT.Addressing a news conference, NTSB member Todd Inman said on Wednesday that security footage showed the MD-11 jet’s left engine detaching from the wing as it rolled down the runway for takeoff.He said the aircraft, which had two other engines, cleared a fence at the end of the runway before crashing outside the airport and igniting a fire that spread for nearly half a mile.US federal safety investigators have also recovered the plane’s “black box” from the wreckage, Inman said in the agency’s first briefing since the disaster.He said both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, designed to withstand severe impact and extreme heat, appeared to be intact when they were found on Wednesday amid the crash debris.US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse said investigators are likely to focus on the engine, which video footage shows catching fire and detaching from the aircraft.""It is designed to fly if you lose one engine, but we need to see the effect of losing that engine on the rest of the aircraft,” Brickhouse was quoted as saying by Reuters.The crash sparked a massive fire that spread for about half a mile, fueled by the large quantity of jet fuel onboard. The aircraft, carrying roughly 38,000 gallons (144,000 liters) of fuel for a 4,300-mile (6,920 km) flight to Hawaii, was engulfed in a fireball upon impact, Inman said.The blaze tore through an industrial corridor, igniting multiple fires and explosions, including at a petroleum recycling facility, and scattering debris across nearly half a mile (800 meters).About 200 firefighters and emergency personnel, along with 50 trucks, were deployed Tuesday to battle the blaze that sent thick black smoke billowing into the evening sky.Despite the massive fire, governor Beshear said nearby structures, including a convention center, a restaurant, and a Ford Motor Co plant, were not damaged.Independent Pilots Association President Captain Bob Travis said all three pilots aboard the plane were on duty at the time of the crash. The union, which represents about 3,300 UPS pilots, is participating in the NTSB-led investigation, Travis said in an interview, as cited by Reuters.Flight records indicate that the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, built in 1991, underwent maintenance while grounded in San Antonio for over a month until mid-October. The nature of the work carried out remains unclear, as reported by AP.","US federal safety investigators have recovered the plane’s “black box” from the wreckage.

What DHS said?





What Witness said?









Immigration officers entered a pre-school in Chicago with arms while chasing a teacher, and teachers and students looked on.Immigration officers arrested a teacher early Wednesday at Rayito de Sol, a private preschool in Chicago, because she is an undocumented immigrant who had been caught and released at the border under Biden administration policies on June 26, 2023, Fox News reported.Several parents said they were waiting to drop off their children around 7 am at Rayito de Sol, a Spanish immersion day care and school, when they saw armed officers in black vests bearing the words “POLICE ICE” run behind the woman and into the lobby.The agents dragged the woman outside as she yelled, “Tengo papeles!” or “I have papers.” The arrest appears to be one of the first instances during Trump’s second administration in which immigration officers entered school grounds to make an arrest.During the Biden and Obama administrations, schools were considered “sensitive locations,” and agents were barred from entering with few exceptions.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin disputed that the woman was arrested inside the school, saying she was detained in “a vestibule.”The agency said that the driver “sped into a shopping plaza where he and the female passenger fled the vehicle,” and then ran into the school and barricaded themselves inside.“Upon arrest, she lied about her identity,” McLaughlin said.Bystander video of the arrest shows agents in both the lobby area and farther inside the school. Immigration officers generally are allowed to enter public areas of a building without a warrant, unless it is private property where there is a “reasonable expectation of privacy.” “If they can do this at a day care where children are, where will they not go?” said Chicago Alderman Matt Martin, who represents the North Side community where the preschool is located.Witnesses said the teacher was followed by a dark-coloured SUV as she rode to school in the passenger seat of a sedan. According to DHS, officers attempted to pull the vehicle over with sirens and emergency lights, but the driver did not stop.The agency said that the driver “sped into a shopping plaza where he and the female passenger fled the vehicle,” and then ran into the school and barricaded themselves inside.School officials showed agents the teacher’s employment documents, including a work permit, Martin said, but agents nonetheless detained her.“She’s a wonderful person, a mother, an excellent community member, and a valued and treasured member of the Rayito community,” said Tara Goodarzi, an attorney whose child attends the school. “We have absolutely no idea why she was targeted.” Martin said one armed agent stayed inside after the arrest, walked around the facility room to room and questioned several adults.","Immigration officers arrested a teacher at Rayito de Sol, a private preschool in Chicago.

What has changed for Ukraine’s young men

‘Will Rip Apart…’: Putin Dares Trump As US Mulls Tomahawks For Ukraine | Watch

Why is Ukraine making this change now

Pressure from allies versus domestic priorities



Families welcome the change

What it means for Ukraine’s war





For the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022, Ukraine is easing its strict wartime travel restrictions on men. A new regulation, effective August 29, 2025, will allow men aged 18 to 22 to leave the country freely until they turn 23. The move marks a significant shift from the blanket ban that had barred all men between 18 and 60 from traveling abroad, even those not yet eligible for the draft. Kyiv says the change is aimed at education, employment, and keeping younger Ukrainians tied to their homeland, but it raises questions about military manpower.Since the start of martial law in 2022, Ukraine barred men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, ensuring a reserve pool of soldiers. Now, for the first time, men between 18 and 22 are allowed to travel abroad until they turn 23. This creates a five-year window where they can pursue studies, internships, or jobs outside Ukraine before becoming subject to the draft again.Government officials say the change is meant to reduce the pressure on families and discourage teenagers from fleeing before they turn 18. Instead of being forced into permanent exile, young men will be able to leave legally, gain international experience, and later return to support Ukraine with their skills.The timing of this policy change reflects both practical and political concerns. After three years of war, Ukraine faces not only a battlefield challenge but also a demographic crisis. The country already has one of the fastest-declining populations in Europe, worsened by refugee outflows, falling birth rates, and war casualties. The pool of men in their early 20s is particularly small, owing to demographic dips after the collapse of the Soviet Union.By giving young men a chance to leave temporarily, Ukraine is signaling that it wants to maintain ties with its youth rather than push them into permanent exile. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko explained that many teenagers had fled before turning 18 out of fear of being trapped, and this rule aims to stop that exodus. The government also believes the change may improve morale among young people and families, who often feel caught between duty to the state and personal safety.Ukraine’s Western allies, particularly the United States, have been urging Kyiv to expand its mobilization pool. American lawmakers have openly suggested lowering the draft age to 18, arguing that Ukraine must maximize every available soldier if it hopes to withstand Russia’s larger military and population base.Instead of complying, Kyiv has gone in the opposite direction—loosening restrictions and allowing more young men to leave. To some, this looks like a contradiction in the middle of a grinding war of attrition. Military analysts note that Ukraine’s manpower shortages are one of its most serious challenges on the battlefield, and shrinking the mobilization reserve could make matters worse.Ukrainian officials defend the move as necessary to preserve social cohesion. They argue that forcing young men to stay creates resentment, weakens trust in the government, and encourages illegal migration. By offering legal pathways to travel, the government hopes to maintain loyalty and keep young Ukrainians invested in the country’s future.Among ordinary Ukrainians, the decision is broadly popular. Families who previously rushed to send their sons abroad before their 18th birthdays now have more time to make decisions without feeling panicked. Refugee families with sons who turned 18 while abroad also gain peace of mind, as those young men can now visit Ukraine temporarily without the risk of being trapped.Mothers, in particular, describe the new regulation as a relief. Many say it gives their children the chance to experience a normal life—seeing the sea, traveling without fear, or simply taking a break from the daily reality of air raid sirens. For families still in Ukraine, the rule offers a psychological cushion, making them feel less pressured and more hopeful about the future.The broader implications of this move are still unclear. On the one hand, it reduces Ukraine’s short-term mobilization pool at a time when its military is struggling with exhaustion, casualties, and recruitment shortages. Military experts warn that any reduction in available manpower could weaken Kyiv’s ability to sustain a prolonged conflict against Russia’s much larger population and army.On the other hand, some analysts argue that the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. By keeping young Ukrainians connected to their homeland, Kyiv hopes to ensure that when they do return, they will bring back knowledge, resources, and international connections that strengthen the country. This policy change is part of a broader effort to maintain national connections and address demographic challenges amid ongoing martial law. The decision also reflects a broader understanding that war is not fought only on the battlefield but also in society—where trust, morale, and future stability matter as much as troop numbers.Ultimately, the new regulation represents a gamble: Ukraine is betting that preserving the future of its youth is worth the risk of a smaller mobilization pool today. Whether this gamble pays off may depend on how long the war drags on—and whether Western allies see this move as strengthening or undermining Ukraine’s war effort.","For the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022, Ukraine is easing its strict wartime travel restrictions on men. A new regulation, effective August 29, 2025, will allow men aged 18 to 22 to leave the country freely until they turn 23. The move marks a significant shift from the blanket ban that had barred all men between 18 and 60 from traveling abroad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123564923,imgsize-91632,width-400,resizemode-4/ukraine-allows-young-men-to-leave-the-country-why-kyiv-is-suddenly-easing-its-wartime-travel-ban.jpg"
US Army is using TikTok to recruit young soldiers: How influencers are selling military life to Gen Z,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-army-is-using-tiktok-to-recruit-young-soldiers-how-influencers-are-selling-military-life-to-gen-z/articleshow/123563675.cms,"The US Army’s TikTok strategy to recruit young soldiers

The rise of military influencers

Controversy and criticism surround TikTok recruitment strategy

What this means for Gen Z recruitment





The US Army has increasingly embraced social media to reach its next generation of recruits, with TikTok emerging as a surprising tool in this strategy. Although the platform is officially banned on government devices due to security concerns, recruiters and influencers are still using it to promote enlistment. Young soldiers and veterans share polished videos that highlight the benefits of service, from educational opportunities and financial stability to camaraderie and adventure. This shift represents a significant change in recruitment methods, targeting Gen Z where they spend much of their time, scrolling on social media platforms.Despite ongoing political scrutiny over TikTok’s Chinese ownership, the platform remains one of the most effective ways of engaging Gen Z audiences. Traditional recruitment methods such as posters, leaflets, or television adverts rarely capture the attention of young people today. In contrast, short, engaging clips that align with popular trends, music and humour present military life as both relatable and aspirational. From behind-the-scenes looks at training to humorous portrayals of daily routines, TikTok allows the Army to project an image of service that feels modern and accessible.An increasing number of military-affiliated influencers have appeared on TikTok, attracting audiences that number from thousands to millions. Many are current or former soldiers who act as unofficial ambassadors for the Army. Their videos often highlight the perceived benefits of enlistment, ranging from financial security and healthcare to subsidised education and opportunities for global travel. While some work directly with recruitment offices, others share their experiences independently. For many young viewers, this influencer-driven content is far more persuasive than official recruitment campaigns, presenting the Army as an attainable and rewarding career choice.The Army’s reliance on TikTok has sparked debate. Critics argue that presenting service through carefully curated content risks downplaying the dangers, sacrifices and mental toll associated with military life. Others highlight the irony of the US Army turning to a platform that American lawmakers frequently describe as a security threat. Still, the strategy continues, largely because it delivers results. Recruitment numbers among Gen Z, often sceptical of traditional authority, show signs of improvement when relatable influencers deliver the message.By embedding itself in the digital lives of young people, the US Army is reshaping its recruitment approach. Rather than relying solely on schools, career fairs or conventional advertising, the military is now meeting Gen Z on the platforms they use daily. This reflects a wider trend of institutions adapting to the attention economy, where relatability and influence can outweigh formality and authority. It shows that in the era of memes and short videos, even something as serious as military recruitment has to keep up with the scroll. Whether this strategy secures long-term recruitment success or draws further criticism, it highlights the immense power of social media in shaping decisions as significant as joining the armed forces.","The US Army has increasingly embraced social media to reach its next generation of recruits.

Susan Monarez has resigned as director of the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) just weeks after formally assuming the role, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, particularly over changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel.According to individuals who spoke to the portal on the condition of anonymity, Monarez had clashed with Kennedy over his decision to remove and replace members of the influential immunization policy committee with individuals critical of existing vaccine guidelines.Her short tenure coincided with significant restructuring at the CDC, including workforce reductions, budget cuts, and the elimination of some core agency functions. She had previously served as acting director since President Donald Trump took office and was confirmed after the president withdrew his earlier nominee, Dr. David Weldon.Dr. Monarez was reportedly required to coordinate policy decisions with both Matt Buckham, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Matt Buzelli, chief of staff at the CDC.Last week, HHS appointed a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccines to lead a subcommittee on vaccine safety, sparking concern among public health professionals. Meanwhile, CDC employees issued an open letter urging Kennedy to stop promoting what they called ""inaccurate information"" about vaccines.Monarez appeared to support their concerns, expressing worry about misinformation in an internal note, though without directly naming Kennedy.She had also received praise from CDC staff for her empathetic leadership following a recent shooting at the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, in which a gunman—believed to be motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs—killed a police officer and fired on the building.As of now, no official comment has been provided by the department of health and human services.","Susan Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F.

US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash from customers and political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who criticised its recent rebrand.The Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain confirmed in a statement on its website that it would keep its traditional emblem featuring an elderly man in overalls, known as “Uncle Herschel,” sitting next to a barrel alongside the words “Old Country Store.” “We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base. The chain said its 70,000 employees now look forward to “welcoming you to our table soon.”","US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash.

‘Living in terror’: Trump’s law enforcement surge sparks anxiety in DC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/living-in-terror-trumps-law-enforcement-surge-sparks-anxiety-in-dc-mayor-bowser-raises-concerns/articleshow/123567598.cms,"Muriel Bowser (left), Donald Trump (AP)

As US President Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement surge nears the end of its third week in Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.While Bowser acknowledged that the increased federal presence has helped push crime trends in a positive direction, she criticised the role of masked ICE agents and out-of-state national guard troops operating in the city, according to a report by WTOPnews.“There’s tremendous anxiety in the District,” Bowser said at a recent press conference. “When I look and I see residents putting things on social media or neighborhood chats, I know that there is a lot of anxiety. There’s a lot of anxiety with kids going back to school,” as quoted by the portal.The Mayor specifically referred to a recent incident reported by the news agency AP, where federal officers made an arrest near Bancroft Elementary School in Mount Pleasant, prompting chants from residents. Some of the officers reportedly had their faces covered, further intensifying public fear.Bowser confirmed to the portal that US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents have been riding along with DC police officers during traffic stops, particularly those involving mopeds.However, the city, she said, has no access to information about who ICE detains.“I am concerned, for sure, because we think anything that we do and anything that we’re going to ask federal partners to do is focused on violent crime,” she said.DC is home to many residents with temporary protected status, and Bowser warned that the current enforcement approach risks alienating both documented and undocumented individuals.“Whether you have documents or you’re undocumented, you almost feel like you’re being caught up in a dragnet, and that is horrible,” she said. To Hispanic workers living in fear, she added: “I would express to them as a neighbor how very sorry I am that they’re living in this terror,” the mayor was quoted.Police chief Pamela Smith also acknowledged the hesitation among residents to reach out for help due to fear. Deputy mayor for public safety and justice Lindsey Appiah reiterated the city’s appeal: “We do want people to continue to call when they need help.”The federal deployment is currently set to end on September 10 unless President Trump seeks congressional approval for an extension. Bowser said the city would be ready to work with federal resources differently once the 30-day period ends.“We will be prepared to take advantage of additional federal officers to focus on beautification, to support the federal task force, when that time period expires,” she said.Despite tensions, crime in the city is reportedly down compared to the same period last year. Bowser also emphasised the need to strengthen DC’s police force by hiring 500 more officers to reach a 4,000-member target over the coming years.",DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly voiced concern over the growing anxiety among residents - especially in immigrant communities.

Minneapolis Shooting: Leavitt Blasts Jen Psaki’s ‘Prayer’ Comment; Gives Big Probe Update





Former White House press secretary and current MSNBC host Jen Psaki launched a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, accusing them of offering only “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of a deadly school shooting in Minneapolis.In a strongly worded post on X, Psaki dsaid traditional calls for prayer not enough, targeting Trump administration's condolatory remarks on the Annunciation school shooting. “Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers do not end school shootings. Prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers,” she wrote.Psaki, who served as President Joe Biden’s press secretary, accused American leaders of falling into a repetitive cycle after every mass shooting. “Like clockwork, half the politicians in our country have little more to offer than thoughts and prayers — that is all they are offering,” she said during her MSNBC segment.She singled out Trump and Vance for limiting their initial responses to urging the public to join them in prayer. “We have seen this play out over and over. There is a shooting, then come the thoughts and prayers and then comes the attempt to shift the focus,” Psaki added, warning that discussions about the shooter’s transgender identity were being used as a distraction from the larger issue of gun control.Her remarks sparked a sharp reaction online, with critics accusing her of politicising a tragedy and showing disrespect toward faith-based traditions of mourning.“I don’t expect a spiritually blind person to understand prayer, but it is real. Today I attended the funeral of a baby, and often when parents are in the depths of grief, Jesus is their greatest comforter. You should investigate why that is, rather than belittling it,” Karen Hamilton, a candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates, said in response.Authorities said two children, aged 8 and 10, were killed and at least 17 injured in Minneapolis school shooting when the gunman opened fire during Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman was found dead due to self-inflicted injuries.","Former White House press secretary and current MSNBC host Jen Psaki launched a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

Before ejecting from a US Air Force F-35 fighter jet that crashed in Alaska in January , the pilot spent nearly an hour on a mid-air conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers in an attempt to resolve the issue, according to an accident report released this week.As per the CNN-published report, the incident began shortly after take-off when the pilot attempted to retract the landing gear. The gear failed to retract fully, and when he lowered it again, the nose wheel locked at an angle to the left.After running through system checklists, the pilot initiated a mid-air conference call with five engineers from Lockheed Martin, the plane's manufacturer. The group included: a senior software engineer, a flight safety engineer, and three landing-gear specialists. The call lasted 50 minutes as they tried to troubleshoot the malfunction.The pilot then attempted two “touch-and-go” landings - brief contacts with the runway designed to realign the jammed nose wheel. Instead, the manoeuvres caused further damage, leaving both the left and right main landing gears frozen and unable to extend for a safe landing.At that stage, the F-35’s sensors mistakenly registered that the jet was on the ground, triggering a switch to “automated ground-operation mode.”This left the aircraft effectively “uncontrollable,” as its systems responded as though it was on the ground, rather than flying.With no other options left, the pilot ejected. The jet dropped straight down and exploded in a fireball.The January 28 crash at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska's Fairbanks was recorded in a video that showed the aircraft dropping straight down and exploding in a fireball. The pilot suffered only minor injuries.A US Air Force investigation later determined that the crash was caused by ice in the hydraulic lines of the nose and main landing gears, which prevented them from functioning properly.","The January 28 crash at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska's Fairbanks was recorded in a video that showed the aircraft dropping straight down and exploding in a fireball.

Trump Furious As Israel Hits Gaza Hospital; Bashes Bibi After 20 Kids, Journalists Killed

President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) chaired a 'policy meet' to hold discussions on the future of Gaza at the White House, which was breifed by former UK prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who presented ideas for a 'post-war' plan.While the specifics of the 'plan' remain unclear, the talks centred on governance, humanitarian assistance and security arrangements in Gaza, including talks on boosting food aid deliveries, resolving the hostage crisis, and shaping proposals for Gaza’s future once the conflict ends, were discussed for over an hour, according to Reuters.Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a key architect of Trump’s Middle East policy during his first term but does not hold a formal role in the current administration, has been informally advising White House officials since Trump returned to office in January.The session was also attended by US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and other senior administration aides.Ahead of the talks, Witkoff had told Fox News that Trump would convene “a large meeting” on Gaza. “It is a very comprehensive plan we are putting together on the next day (in Gaza), and many people are going to see how robust it is and how well-meaning it is. It reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here,” he said.He also suggested the administration believes the war could end by the end of this year.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is under growing pressure from protesters and the country’s military leadership to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal, instead of pushing ahead with his plan to broaden the military offensive.Witkoff has been in regular contact with Blair and Kushner for several months over the post-war strategy, reported Axios. Blair had met Witkoff at the White House in July — the same day Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu conferred with Trump, before briefing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the discussions in Washington.The details of Trump’s post-war blueprint remain unclear, particularly on how Gaza’s reconstruction would be carried out and who would ultimately oversee the enclave’s governance.","Donald Trump holds meeting on Gaza City post-war plan.

Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

"Violence against minorities in Pakistan: Conversions, blasphemy killings on rise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/violence-against-minorities-in-pakistan-conversions-blasphemy-killings-on-rise-what-human-rights-panel-said/articleshow/123431097.cms,"Forced conversions

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.
