in city, man electrocuted

NEW DELHI: The flooded underpasses in the capital have taken a heavy toll with four lives being lost in them between Friday and Saturday following the torrential rain which disrupted normal life. This has brought the toll in the city in the aftermath of the intense downpour to 11.A 60-year-old security guard 's body was removed from an underpass in Okhla in south Delhi while another body of a young man, about 20 years old, was taken out of the flooded Shalimar Bagh underpass in north-west Delhi on Friday.The latter is still to be identified. Meanwhile, two boys, aged around 12, drowned in another waterlogged underpass in Samaypur Badli, also in north-west Delhi, on Saturday.The reasons for the senseless deaths was in one case a desperate attempt to cross to the other side for work and in the rest going for a swim or bath. In either case, the authorities must be blamed for being negligent in not barring access to the underpasses early enough and not draining out the water fast enough.Though some parts of the city witnessed light rain on Saturday, IMD has sounded an orange alert for moderate to heavy rain Sunday and heavy rain Monday and Tuesday.At 6.23am on Friday, police received information about a man having drowned in the water at the Okhla underpass. ""A passerby spotted him in the water with a scooter found nearby,"" said a senior officer. A team from the local police station rushed to the scene and pulled the man out. They found an Aadhaar card in his pocket which identified him as Digvijay Kumar Chaudhary, a resident of Jaitpur Extension.He worked as a security guard at a private firm in Okhla Phase 2 and was probably on his way to work when the incident occurred. The man was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he was declared dead. Police have initiated legal proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC. The underpass is managed by DDA but a spokesperson denied any knowledge of the incident.In the incident at the Samaypur Badli underpass, bodies of the two boys were fished out at 4:15 pm on Saturday after the police responded to a call at 2:25 pm. ""Upon reaching the spot, we found that the underpass near the metro had approximately 2.5-3 feet of water,"" the officer said.One of the deceased was identified as a resident of Siraspur while the other remains unidentified. Proceedings under Section 174 of CrPC have been initiated.In other incidents, two boys had drowned in a ditch in northeast Delhi's New Usmanpur while a 40-year-old man was electrocuted in Prem Nagar, north-west Delhi, on Friday.Meanwhile, bodies of three labourers were finally recovered from a pit in Vasant Vihar on Saturday morning, more than 24 hours after they got buried in mud because of a mishap at a construction site.On Friday, a canopy at the forecourt of Terminal 1 at IGI Airport had collapsed, leaving a cabbie dead and eight injured.","A 60-year-old security guard's body was removed from an underpass in Okhla in south Delhi.

The judiciary must be absolutely pure, honest and sacred, and let people revere it like a temple.""The CJI appeared to concur, as he said judges should refrain from allowing their personal ideologies to influence their judgments.Mamata's remarks come at a time when her govt's relationship with the judiciary has been fraught with tension, with the CM even criticising some of the HC rulings in the recent past.In a post on her X handle later, she said: ""Judiciary stands as a guardian of our constitutional rights, a beacon of justice, and a cornerstone of our democratic framework. In these times, more than ever, we must strive to uphold the purity and honesty of our judicial processes, free from any political bias. People place immense faith in the judiciary, looking to it as a source of fairness and truth. It is this trust that we must honour and protect.""Chandrachud, on his part, emphasised that judgments should be based on constitutional morality , not a judge's idea of morality. Reminding the judges that they were ""servants"" of the constitution, not its ""masters"", he said the values judges had to espouse were values the Constitution had enshrined for them, whether they liked it or not - ""that is, a society based on human dignity, fraternity, equality, liberty, respect for all, tolerance for all and inclusion of all"".The CJI, however, expressed reservations at the use of the term "" temple of justice "" for courts. ""Because 'temples' postulate that judges are in the role of deities. I would rather recast the role of judges as servers of the people.

PANAJI: Goa police have said in a report to the state chief secretary that they were pressured by DGP Jaspal Singh to allow demolition of an Assagao house occupied by a Goan family in order to help Mumbai resident Pooja Sharma, a senior intelligence officer's wife, get the property vacated , reported.Besides instructing them to not take any action against Pooja, the report said the DGP threatened Anjuna police officers that if the ""demolition work"" was not allowed to continue they would have to ""face the consequences"".The report said when Anjuna police tried to stop the demolition, ""the DGP started shouting"" and said it should be demolished at any cost. He also instructed them that ""if any person is obstructing the demolition they should be brought to the police station"".In a chronology of events that transpired on June 22, the report said at 2.32pm, Anjuna police got a call from Panaji police control room that a person needs their help as “some persons are demolishing his house near Ganga tiles factory at Assagao”.Anjuna police sub-inspectors (PSIs) Sanket Pokhare and Nitin Naik rushed to the spot and found an excavator was demolishing the house — ground plus one floor. Pradeep Agarwadekar and his family, who were present on the spot, claimed that they were inside the house when they started demolishing.“Pokhare told the people to stop the demolition work, while asking the Agarwadekars to produce the documents of the house. He also directed the excavator operator to bring the vehicle to the police station,” the report said.While Anjuna police were carrying out their duty, they got a call from the DGP, “asking why the work of demolition of the house has been stopped”. When he was apprised about the situation, the report said, he got angry and said, “there was nobody inside the house when the demolition work was going as he has personally verified it”.The report said the DGP was pressurising Anjuna police to “take the occupants of the house to the police station and to allow the demolition work to continue”. Instead, Anjuna police instructed the Agarwadekars to come to the station and lodge a complaint.Pradeep Agarwadekar’s wife Prinsha along with her daughter came to the police station, while her husband and son stayed back at the site.The report said while they were at the police station, a person Arshad Khawaja came and told police that he was demolishing the house “as per the instructions from the top officer”. He told them that they would have received a phone call from the top officer.Khawaja also told them that he had received instructions to start the work again and said they could get in touch with him if they had any doubts. “Khawaja shared his mobile number.”The owner of the excavator, Ashley Rodrigues, also went to the police station and said Khawaja had told him that he has “contacts with top officials and that he (Khawaja) will manage all things on the spot”.The DGP called Anjuna police again and directed that “anyhow the work of demolition of the house must take place and no one should stop the work… to allow Arshad Khawaja to continue demolishing the house”.The Anjuna police report also said DGP Singh told them “Pooja Sharma is the owner of the property, and no cognisable offence is made out into the complaint of Prinsha Agarwadekar.

The flyover, which stands at a height of over 35 feet, was the scene of the accident when Vivek and his friend Aman Yadav, also 19, were knocked down by a speeding vehicle while they were out for a run. Aman, a second-year BMS student, survived the incident but suffered multiple fractures and head injuries.He is currently undergoing treatment at Seven Hills Hospital and is set to undergo surgery.The incident came to light when a group of cyclists noticed Aman lying on the bridge at around 6:12 am. However, there was no sign of Vivek, who had fallen from the flyover. ""The team is trying to track the accused vehicle that knocked the two on the flyover.

Amrit Rajkhowa, one of the cyclists who discovered the victims, along with five others, rushed them to the nearest hospital. However, due to the financial constraints of the families, they had to be transferred to another hospital. ""They were unable to deposit even Rs10,000.

Despite of that, Vivek's father took him to Cooper hospital who passed away at 10.30 am,"" said Rajkhowa.Rajkhowa pointed out that the absence of a barricade on the side wall of the flyover contributed to Vivek's fall. Additionally, the street lights were switched off at 5:45 am, which may have prevented the motorist from noticing the two runners. ""Aman was found in shock, but conscious. He couldn't recall what had hit them. His left lower leg was swollen indicating multiple fractures.

A private call of top Democrats fuels more insider anger about Biden's debate performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-private-call-of-top-democrats-fuels-more-insider-anger-about-bidens-debate-performance/articleshow/111373892.cms,"NEW YORK: A sense of concern is growing inside the top ranks of the Democratic Party that leaders of Joe Biden 's campaign and the Democratic National Committee are not taking seriously enough the impact of the president's troubling debate performance earlier in the week. DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country, a group of some of the most influential members of the party.He did not acknowledge Biden's weak showing Thursday night or the avalanche of criticism that followed.Multiple committee members on the call, granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being gaslighted - that they were being asked to ignore the dire nature of the party's predicament. The call, they said, may have worsened a widespread sense of panic among elected officials, donors and other stakeholders.Instead, the people said, Harrison offered what they described as a rosy assessment of Biden's path forward. The chat function was disabled and there were no questions allowed.Many donors, party strategists and rank-and-file DNC members are publicly and privately saying they want the 81-year-old Biden to step aside to allow the party to select a younger replacement at the Democratic National Convention in August. As of now, though, Biden's closest allies insist he remains well-positioned to compete against Republican Donald Trump and have given no indication they will push him to end his campaign.Those best positioned to replace him - Vice President Kamala Harris, California governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them - reiterated their support for Biden after the debate.Many are anxiously awaiting the first major round of post-debate public polling to determine their next steps.Polls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men's favourability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump's conviction on charges in New York that he illegally participated in a hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election.In a subsequent appearance on MSNBC, Harrison downplayed the significance of the conference call, which he said was part of a regularly scheduled communication ""to talk about the state of the race"" and the upcoming national convention with the DNC's many elected members across the country.Biden and his campaign have sought to project confidence in the days since Thursday's debate in which the president, who already faced serious concerns about his physical and mental stamina, offered a performance punctuated by repeated stumbles, uncomfortable pauses, and a quiet speaking style that was often difficult to understand.Just after Saturday's DNC call, the Biden campaign released a memo from senior adviser Jen O'Malley Dillon insisting that the debate had no tangible impact on the election.""On every metric that matters, data shows it did nothing to change the American people's perception, our supporters are more fired up than ever, and Donald Trump only reminded voters of why they fired him four years ago and failed to expand his appeal beyond his MAGA base,"" O'Malley Dillon wrote.She added, ""If we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls.""Meanwhile, Biden spent much of Saturday courting wealthy donors in New York's famed wealthy enclave of the Hamptons.""I didn't have a great night, but neither did Trump,"" Biden said of the debate at one gathering in East Hampton.Of Trump, Biden said, ""The big takeaway was his lies.""Trump, meanwhile, gloated about Biden's performance at a rally Friday and suggested on his social media platform Saturday that Biden had faded ""under tremendous pressure."""," DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country.

The Post's managing editor abruptly resigned; a chosen successor withdrew under fire, and a boss has been targeted in the newspaper's columns.At the heart of the storm is the ""WaPo""'s new CEO, Briton William Lewis , who was given a mission by Amazon founder Bezos when he appointed him last autumn.Lewis was asked to turn around a newspaper that continues to pile up Pulitzer Prizes half a century after the Watergate scandal it instigated, but which has lost $77 million in 2023 despite job cuts and the disappearance of its Sunday supplement. However, the former journalist, who made history in the 2000s with a scoop on the expenses of British MPs when he was editor of the Daily Telegraph, is finding his position increasingly vulnerable.For weeks now, revelations have multiplied about his role, when he was working for the Murdoch family's conservative media group about 12 years ago, in a scandal of illegal phone tapping by the tabloid The News of the World. On Friday, Lewis was at the centre of an investigation by his own journalists. According to the Washington Post, he gave the go-ahead in 2011 for the destruction of thousands of emails, fuelling suspicions that he was destroying evidence, which he denies.As the US presidential election approaches, the affair is poisoning the atmosphere at a long-vaunted newspaper that is ""not doing well economically,"" says Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy.The Post was among trusted news outlets that benefited from the upheaval that marked Trump's four years in the White House that ended with his loss to President Joe Biden. Trump's departure from the White House meant fewer attention-grabbing stories to keep readers engaged.

She has significant experience in the Senate and has been a visible member of the Biden administration. However, her own presidential campaign in 2020 struggled to gain traction, raising questions about her viability as the top candidate. Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has maintained a high profile since his own 2020 presidential bid. His articulate communication style and experience as a cabinet member make him a strong contender. California governor Gavin Newsom: Newsom has been a vocal and high-profile governor, particularly noted for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in California. His progressive policies and strong state leadership position him as a potential candidate should Biden withdraw. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer: Whitmer has gained national attention for her leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and her strong stance on various social issues. Her popularity in a key swing state adds to her potential candidacy. Senator Elizabeth Warren: Warren, known for her progressive stance on economic issues and her strong advocacy for consumer protection, remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party. Her extensive policy knowledge and previous campaign experience make her a viable option.

NEW DELHI: The fallout from President Joe Biden 's faltering performance at the first 2024 US presidential debate has sent shockwaves through the Democratic party.Biden, the 81-year-old incumbent, struggled to stem a barrage of attacks and false claims from his Republican rival Donald Trump , leaving his allies scrambling to contain the damage.The debate, which took place far earlier in the campaign than any modern presidential debate, was seen as a critical test for Biden to quell concerns about his age and fitness for office.Instead, a hoarse-sounding Biden stumbled over his words at times, especially in the early stages, leading one anonymous Biden donor to call his performance ""disqualifying"".Panicked Democrats exchanged messages wondering whether Biden would consider stepping down, though White House officials said he was simply suffering from a cold.The rough debate performance has prompted some to call for Biden to stand down, sparking discussions within the Democratic party about who could take his place.According to a report by Forbes, several prominent figures are being considered as likely candidates:The debate over Biden's potential withdrawal and the emergence of these candidates highlight the dynamic and uncertain nature of the upcoming election.Democratic strategist James Carville commented, ""The party needs to be prepared for all scenarios. We have a strong bench, and it's crucial to ensure we have the best candidate to continue our agenda.""As the situation develops, the Democratic party will be closely monitoring Biden's performance and public sentiment.The potential candidates are positioning themselves for what could become a significant shift in the race for the White House.","Biden's faltering performance at the first 2024 US presidential debate has sent shockwaves through the Democratic party.

North Korea executes man for listening to 70 K-pop songs: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-executes-man-for-listening-to-70-k-pop-songs-report/articleshow/111331129.cms,"A recent report by South Korea's unification ministry has revealed the extreme measures taken by North Korean authorities to control the influx of foreign culture and information, particularly from South Korea. The 2024 Report on North Korean Human Rights, which compiles testimonies from 649 North Korean defectors , highlights a disturbing case of a 22-year-old man from South Hwanghae province who was publicly executed in 2022 for ""listening to 70 South Korean songs , watching three films, and distributing them,"" violating a 2020 North Korean law that prohibits ""reactionary ideology and culture"".The Guardian said that the report also details other instances of crackdowns on practices deemed ""reactionary,"" such as brides wearing white dresses, grooms carrying the bride, wearing sunglasses, or drinking alcohol from wine glasses, all of which are perceived as South Korean customs.Additionally, mobile phones are frequently inspected for contact name spellings, expressions, and slang terms that are considered to be influenced by South Korea, despite the fact that both Koreas share the same language with subtle differences that have emerged since the division after the Korean War of 1950-1953.The ban on K-pop is part of a larger campaign initiated by former leader Kim Jong-il and intensified under his son Kim Jong-un to protect North Koreans from the perceived negative influence of Western culture .In 2022, the US government-funded Radio Free Asia reported that the regime was cracking down on ""capitalist"" fashion and hairstyles, targeting skinny jeans, T-shirts with foreign words, and dyed or long hair. Experts believe that allowing South Korean popular culture to infiltrate North Korean society could threaten the ideology that demands absolute loyalty to the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.Despite the harsh measures implemented by the North Korean government, the influence of South Korean culture appears to be unstoppable, according to a recent North Korean defector.The woman in her early 20s, who defected from North Korea, said, ""The speed of South Korean culture influencing North Korea is seriously fast. Young people follow and copy South Korean culture, and they really love anything South Korean.""Information continues to seep through and be distributed via informal networks, even with the border to China largely sealed off due to the Covid-19 outbreak.In recent weeks, North Korea has retaliated against the launch of balloons from the South containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, dollar bills, and USB sticks loaded with K-pop and K-dramas by sending thousands of balloons over the border containing waste.The defector also shed light on the hidden resentment against the regime, saying, ""Of course we cannot say anything bad against Kim Jong-un publicly, but among close friends, lovers or family members, we do say those words.""She added, ""After watching Korean dramas, many young people wonder, 'Why do we have to live like this?' ...

Panicked Democrats call for Joe Biden to stand down after debate debacle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panicked-democrats-call-for-joe-biden-to-stand-down-after-debate-debacle/articleshow/111347303.cms,"WASHINGTON: US Democrats are in panic mode after a disastrous Presidential debate on Thursday night in which their presumptive nominee Joe Biden had what can charitably described as several senior moments, including a brain freeze that became a gif (repeat gif) that will keep on giving.The sitting President's performance was so sketchy and shaky that some Democrats are suggesting he should step down and allow the party convention to nominate a new younger candidate to take on Donald Trump , 78, whose performance at the debate was shallow and superficial, but who at least projected confidence along with his familiar bluster.In contrast, Biden, 81, came across as frail and feeble. Speaking in a thin, raspy voice -- ostensibly because he is recovering from a cold -- he was often incomprehensible and disjointed, his voice trailing off into mumbles. He failed to corner a rival who is a recently convicted felon, and who was winging it with vague generalities and dissembling when asked specific policy questions.Despite calls from some quarters to quit the race, Biden associates said he will be preparing to participate in the second presidential debate on September 10. He will have nearly ten weeks to shape up if he is not shipped out by them.Even Biden partisans were shocked by the evening's debacle.“I love Joe Biden. I know he’s a good man. I know his heart is good. I know he’s dedicated to our country and is surrounded by good people.Tonight was heartbreaking in many ways. This is a big political moment. There’s panic in the Democratic party . It’s going to be a long night,"" Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and a member of the Kennedy family wrote on the social media platform X.Former Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill offered a more blunt take, saying while the debate showcased that Trump is “a liar, a flawed character, mean, a jerk, very unlikable,” Biden ""had one thing he had to accomplish and that was reassure America that he was up to the job at his age, and he failed at that tonight,”“I’m not the only one whose heart is breaking right now. There’s a lot of people who watched this tonight and felt terribly for Joe Biden,” she added.Party veterans tried to stem the panic, suggesting that voters should look at the larger picture. ""It's a choice between someone who cares about you -- your rights, your prospects, your future -- versus someone who's only in it for himself,"" former First Lady, Senator, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said.But with polls showing Biden's age is going against him, there is pressure in the Democratic establishment from activists and donors to act quickly. “Joe had a horrible night, cementing concerns about his age, his greatest electoral weakness. Our odds of Trumpocalypse II just materially increased. It’s tragic, since we could have chosen to let Trump and the nation marinate over him being a convicted felon,” Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a Democratic donor was quoted as saying in an email to party insiders.","Biden, 81, came across as frail and feeble.

Here's what it would take Democrats to replace Joe Biden as party nominee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heres-what-it-would-take-democrats-to-replace-joe-biden-as-party-nominee/articleshow/111370001.cms,"Democrats have ways to replace Joe Biden at the top of their presidential ticket after a harrowing debate against Republican Donald Trump - but doing so without their standard-bearer's acquiescence would be a daunting task. Party members once united behind Biden are now scouring candidate resumes and researching rules for a contingency plan to present voters with a different nominee after a universally panned performance Thursday cemented worries about the President's ability to serve a second term.""The easiest one is, Biden takes himself out of the race,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member and author of a book about the presidential nominating process. ""Then yes, there's rules and procedures and the party would replace him."" While pushing Biden off the ticket is possible, the lack of an obvious candidate to replace him makes such a gambit unlikely, Kamarck said.The debate saw months of Democratic anxiety over Biden, already the oldest US president in history at 81, and his prospects for defeating Trump, boil over.The president Friday acknowledged the limitations of his debate showing but dismissed calls to exit the race.If Biden doesn't step aside, forcing him out would be a Herculean undertaking for Democrats. Any rival would first have to collect 600 delegate signatures on a petition to place his or her name in nomination at the Democratic convention - with no more than 50 signatures from any one state. That's about 13% of the delegates. But with Biden controlling 99% of the pledged delegates, that would require challengers convincing Biden loyalists to flip their support.""The odds are not insurmountable, but they're very high for any scenario that involves a delegate revolt,"" said Josh Putnam of FHQ Strategies, a non-partisan consulting firm specializing in delegate selection rules.The Biden campaign has vetted his delegates for their loyalty, but they do have room to change their minds. Unlike Republican delegates, who are often legally bound to cast their vote for a particular candidate, Democratic rules say only that pledged delegates ""shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.""A move to change the ticket - whether Biden agrees to go willingly or is pushed out - would bring a convention free-for-all not seen for decades.In an ""open"" or ""brokered"" convention, no candidate comes into the roll-call vote with enough delegates to be guaranteed the nomination. Voting could last any number of rounds until a candidate wins.Such a convention would also put so-called ""super-delegates"" in the spotlight. Those delegates - leaders and elected officials who get to the convention by virtue of their position - have been stripped of some powers in recent years as the party worried their influence in the process was undemocratic. But if a nomination goes into a second ballot, those automatic delegates, who number more than 700, could sway the convention.Another wild card is that the party is free to change its rules at any time before the nomination, potentially lowering or raising the bar for a Biden challenger.The most obvious heir apparent is vice-president Kamala Harris - but Democrats don't have to pick Biden's running mate. Some of the most discussed alternatives include Governors Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, all of whom say they still support Biden.The nomination vote was scheduled for Aug 21, but the DNC has raised the possibility of a virtual roll call before Aug 7 to accommodate early ballot deadlines. If Biden steps aside after the convention, the decision on how to replace him would be up to the 400 plus members of the DNC -- the chairman would consult with Democratic congressional lead- ers and governors and make a recommendation.",Democrats have ways to replace Joe Biden at the top of their presidential ticket.

The cinematographer died Oct. 21, 2021, after a gun Baldwin was holding discharged on the ""Rust"" film set.During a two-day hearing, Sommer listened to arguments from Baldwin's legal team claiming that his charges should be dismissed because evidence, including the Pietta 45 Colt revolver replica used in the shooting, was destroyed.The FBI conducted tests on the gun at the prosecution's request, which the court documents describe as ""intentional"" destruction. This, according to the documents, deprives Baldwin of a fair trial, reported Fox News Digital.Earlier, Baldwin's lawyers argue in a motion seeking to dismiss the charge that the firearm in the shooting was heavily damaged by FBI forensic testing before it could be examined for possible modifications that might exonerate the actor.During the fatal rehearsal on October 21, 2021, Baldwin was pointing the gun at Halyna Hutchins on a movie-set ranch when it went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza, who survived. Baldwin says he pulled back the gun's hammer but did not pull the trigger.Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer, was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter and received an 18-month prison sentence for her involvement in the shooting incident. During the trial, an FBI expert testified that the gun was fully functional with safety features intact when it arrived at their laboratory.

Shelters for horses and other large animals have been arranged at locations such as the rodeo grounds at Cave Creek. Scottsdale officials have closed part of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve as a precaution, though they noted there was no immediate threat.Air tankers equipped with red retardant and helicopters with giant buckets of water have supported ground crews in their efforts to keep the flames away from power lines.The National Weather Service forecasts above-normal temperatures to persist into next week, with many desert locations expected to see highs around or above 110 degrees Fahrenheit each afternoon.Meanwhile, conditions have improved south of Bend, Oregon, where the threat from a wildfire near La Pine has decreased, allowing officials to release some of the firefighting crews.

However, Fonseca passed away in a Panamanian hospital in May.Judge Marquinez determined that the evidence obtained from the law firm's servers had not been collected in accordance with due process, casting doubts on its ""authenticity and integrity"". The judge also concluded that ""the rest of the evidence was not sufficient and conclusive to determine the criminal responsibility of the defendants,"" as stated in the court's statement.The ""Panama Papers"" scandal erupted in 2016 when leaked documents from Mossack Fonseca exposed how many wealthy individuals around the world had hidden assets in offshore companies.

Former President Barack Obama on early Saturday shared his thoughts on the recent debate performance , acknowledging that ""Bad debate nights happen."" Drawing from his own experiences, Obama said that the remains a choice between two distinct candidates: one who has consistently fought for the common people and another who prioritises self-interest. He highlighted the importance of honesty and the ability to distinguish right from wrong, contrasting it with someone who ""lies through his teeth for his own benefit."" Obama stressed that the debate's outcome did not alter the high stakes of the November election.""Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight — and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit.Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November,"" the former US president said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).The debate's impact on voters' perceptions of Biden 's fitness for another term in office raised concerns among some Democrats, who questioned whether he should remain their candidate for the upcoming election. Biden's occasional verbal missteps and sometimes meandering responses during the debate amplified these apprehensions.In a spirited campaign rally in North Carolina, a crucial swing state, Biden came out fighting on Friday, attempting to recover from a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump and asserting his suitability to win the presidential election in November. The rally took place amidst whispers within his concerned Democratic party about replacing the 81-year-old as their candidate.Biden candidly admitted to his supporters, ""I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to."" However, he emphatically declared, ""But I know how to tell the truth. I know how to do this job,"" receiving thunderous applause and pledging, ""when you get knocked down, you get back up.""Following Thursday's debate, Biden's team was in damage-control mode as he frequently hesitated, stumbled over words, and lost his train of thought, heightening concerns about his ability to serve another term. He had intended to address doubts about his advanced age and expose Trump as a habitual liar. However, the president failed to counter his bombastic rival, who delivered an unchallenged reel of false or misleading statements about everything from the economy to immigration.During the rally, Biden delivered the lines that Democrats wished they had heard in the televised debate. He questioned, ""Did you see Trump last night? My guess is he set a new record for the most lies told in the single debate."" He then strongly asserted, ""Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation. He's a threat to our freedom. He's a threat to our democracy. He's literally a threat for everything America stands for.""",Former President Barack Obama on early Saturday shared his thoughts on the recent debate performance.

Kabul harbouring TTP leaders, claims Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had requested a decision on her plea filed in the sessions court seeking suspension of her sentence.The court will announce the reserved verdict on June 27 at 3 pm (local time) while the hearing on the couple's plea seeking annulment of their conviction in the said case will be resumed on July 2, Geo News reported.PTI has been awaiting a favorable decision as a major relief for Imran Khan, who has been acquitted in some cases or has been granted bail in others. However, it is also likely that the government will try to block his release as Pakistan prime minister's Adviser on political and public affairs Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday gave credence to the reports that the federal government was planning to register new cases against the incarcerated PTI founder.Speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath', Sanaullah said, ""Imran Khan's main agenda is to destabilise the country and spread chaos and anarchy in the country that's why the government will certainly try to keep him behind bars as long as possible.""Rana Sanaullah made these remarks while responding to a question on reports that the government was planning to delay the release of former Pakistan PM Imran Khan as the courts granted him relief in several cases, according to Geo News report.Sanaullah said Imran Khan ""boycotted"" parliament and launched the agitation movement against the government after the PTI government was ousted through a no-confidence motion in 2022.Pakistan PM's adviser said, ""Persistently he has only one agenda spread anarchy and mischief in the country, hence for the betterment of the country he [Imran Khan] should be kept behind bars.""

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.The operation comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and the Taliban rulers in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Azm-e-Istehkam aims to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan.

Japanese emperor reconnects with River Thames in state visit meant to bolster ties with UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/japanese-emperor-reconnects-with-river-thames-in-state-visit-meant-to-bolster-ties-with-uk/articleshow/111357596.cms,"LONDON: Before Emperor Naruhito of Japan hopped into a horse-drawn carriage with King Charles III, laid a wreath at Westminster Abbey or toured one of Britain's premier biomedical research institutes, he kicked off his trip to the UK by visiting a site that has special meaning for him: The Thames Barrier .While the massive flood control gates on the River Thames don't top most lists of must-see tourist sights, the stopover underscored the emperor's fascination with the waterway that is the throbbing heart of London.That interest was born 40 years ago when Naruhito studied 18th-century commerce on the river as a graduate student at the University of Oxford . But those two years, chronicled in his memoir ""The Thames and I,"" also forged a special fondness for Britain and its people. The future emperor got his first chance to live outside the palace walls, marveling at the kindness of strangers who rushed to help when he dropped his purse, scattering coins across a shop floor, and experiencing traditions like the great British pub crawl.""It would be impossible in Japan to go to a place where hardly anyone would know who I was,'' Naruhito wrote. ""It is really important and precious to have the opportunity to be able to go privately at one's own pace where one wants.''Naruhito and the Empress Masako, who studied at Oxford a few years after her husband, wrapped up a weeklong trip to Britain on Friday. Their itinerary combined the glitter and ceremony of a state visit with four days of less formal events that gave the royal couple an opportunity to revisit their personal connections to Britain.The visit came at a time when the UK is seeking to bolster ties with Japan as it aims to be the most influential European nation in the Indo-Pacific region, said John Nilsson-Wright, the head of the Japan and Koreas program at the Centre for Geopolitics at the University of Cambridge. In October 2020, Britain touted an economic partnership with Japan as the first major international trade agreement it had struck since leaving the European Union earlier that year.""The UK-Japan relationship is hugely important.... It's based on shared common experience. It's based also on the affinity between our two peoples,'' Nilsson-Wright said. ""Britain and Japan can act as a source of stability and, hopefully, mutual reassurance at a time when political change is so potentially destabilizing.""The trip, originally planned for 2020, was intended to be the emperor's first overseas visit after he ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne the previous year. But it was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the death of Queen Elizabeth II, although he did attend her funeral.The state visit began Tuesday, when Charles and Queen Camilla formally welcomed the emperor and empress, then accompanied them on a ceremonial carriage ride to Buckingham Palace . Naruhito later laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey before returning to the palace for a state banquet.But before the pomp and circumstance, Naruhito donned a blue hard hat and toured the Thames Barrier, a series of retractable steel gates that protect London from flooding while allowing ships to continue navigating the river. After the state visit, he and his wife toured their old colleges at Oxford.It was at Merton College that the future emperor, who was born Hironomiya Naruhito, was known simply as Hiro because it was easier for faculty and students to remember (and because the prince liked the sound of it), he wrote in ""The Thames and I.""One of his greatest joys at Merton was to go to the Middle Common Room, a meeting place for graduate students, to drink coffee and talk with other students after lunch.""These moments, with my fellow students, brief as they were, were very important for me,'' Naruhito wrote.Among those students was Keith George, an American law student from West Virginia who lived next door to Naruhito. George jokingly described their relationship as the prince and the pauper, as he was a 22-year-old ""Appalachian hillbilly.""Yet he treasures a framed photograph snapped by Associated Press photographer Peter Kemp on the day they met. Both are wearing white tie and academic gowns. And they are laughing.""It was authentic. It was not contrived,″ George said. ""Yes, when I met him the first time ... you can't help from being completely aware of the fact that this is the Crown Prince, eventually to be the emperor of Japan. But once the dust settles on that note ... it all goes back to: Are you genuine friends or not? We were.""Britain in the 1980s was a revelation to Naruhito because the country seemed to respect the past even as it embraced the future, he wrote in his memoir, recalling the peaceful co-existence of scholars in traditional caps and gowns with young people wearing punk rock garb.""I did not feel that was out of the ordinary,'' Naruhito wrote. ""It seemed to me that both reflected the spirit of the place. This was, after all, a country which produced the Beatles and the miniskirt. I felt that while the British attach importance to old traditions, they also have the ability to innovate.''Naruhito also wrote about the novelty of walking through the streets of Oxford without being noticed, of spending hours in the local records office doing his academic research and of having the chance to do his own shopping and other mundane chores that most people take for granted.And he remembered climbing a hill northeast of the city just to take in the view.""It was best toward sunset,'' he wrote. ""I can never forget the moment when the silhouettes of the spires of Oxford one by one caught the evening light and seemed to float above the mists. This mystical sight, which has aroused so much admiration, is called Oxford's dreaming spires.''But behind it all there was always the River Thames, which flows southeast from Oxford to London before emptying into the North Sea.""I think perhaps (what) it symbolized to him was a combination of beauty and freedom,"" George said.Naruhito began studying river commerce as a boy when Japan's roads and rivers offered a glimpse of travel and freedom outside the confines of the palace. So when he arrived in Oxford, it was logical to study the Thames.Looking back at the research he did 40 years ago, Naruhito is flooded with nostalgia.""The memories of my time with the Thames come back to me,'' he told reporters in Tokyo before visiting Britain. ""The list goes on and on, including my hard work in collecting historical materials ... the beautiful scenery around me that healed me from my fatigue from research, and the days I jogged along the river.''","Emperor Naruhito studied 18th-century commerce on the Thames as a graduate student at Oxford.
