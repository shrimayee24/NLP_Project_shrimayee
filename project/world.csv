KOLKATA: How can’t a PGT doctor’s rape and murder inside a hospital be considered a rarest of rare crime, asked the medical fraternity here, which had carried out a movement for almost two months, demanding justice for the RG Kar victim.Doctors said that given the Kolkaka court’s verdict, they already knew convict Sanjay Roy would either be sentenced to death or life imprisonment but what disheartened them was that a crime, which had evoked spontaneous protests across the globe, was termed “not rarest of rare”.“With due respect to the court’s decision, it is disheartening this case has been termed ‘not rarest of rare’. The death penalty can be appealed in a higher court. Even Supreme Court took up the case suo motu. How can’t this case be rarest of rare?” Tapas Pramanick, emergency medical officer of RG Kar Medical College, said.For him, Roy’s conviction brought about “only a partial closure”. “Till the other influential people involved are arrested, we will continue the agitation and keep up the pressure on CBI and the administration,” he said.Meanwhile, many of the protesters who had taken to streets after the crime, said they would not get a closure till the other perpetrators were brought to justice.“We expect the judiciary to keep this case under active supervision to identify every single culprit responsible for the heinous crime. Legal intervention is an important side of redress but not enough. We also need actionable social change, along with policy-level changes, and that is a long-term struggle,” Rimjhim Sinha, the first one who had called for the ‘Reclaim the Night’ movement on Aug 14 last year.","PGT doctor's rape and murder inside a hospital evoked spontaneous protests across the globe.

"RG Kar ruling: Life term right call, say anti-death advocates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rg-kar-ruling-life-term-right-call-say-anti-death-advocates/articleshow/117410933.cms,"People stage a protest near the Sealdah court Monday. The court emphasised on ‘reform’ rather than ‘retribution’ in the verdict

KOLKATA: Kolkata court judge Anirban Das’s emphasis on “reform” rather than “retribution” in sentencing RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape-and-murder convict Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment, instead of awarding him death penalty, received support from experts and advocacy groups.“The measure of a civilised society lies not in its ability to exact revenge but in its capacity to reform, rehabilitate, and ultimately to heal,” the judge stated.“We are in agreement with the trial court judgment. Benefit of doubt needs to be given to the accused. In this case, there’s a lot of doubt. We do not want to say that he (Sanjay Roy) is innocent. But capital punishment is of no good,” Ranjit Sur, general secretary of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), said.The belief that the death penalty acts as a greater deterrent than life imprisonment is unfounded, Sur added.Senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who was the first counsel to fight the case of the victim’s parents at Calcutta HC, also agreed with the trial court judge’s decision to award life sentence. “He took the right step by not pronouncing death penalty. There should be no death penalty. The judge gave this verdict after examining all the evidence,” Bhattacharya said.Judge Das, referring to the landmark Bachan Singh case which established the guideline for imposing death penalty, stated, “It is evident that this case does not meet the stringent criteria for being classified as ‘rarest of the rare’. Supreme Court has consistently emphasised that death penalty should be used only in exceptional circumstances where the collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it expects the holders of judicial power to inflict the death penalty.”Advocate Phiroze Edulji, who represented the convicts in the 2013 Kamduni gang rape and murder case, said: “I am against death penalty. Which murder is not heinous? It’s all about public perception. Rarest of rare cases where the death penalty is given depends on the judge concerned.”Monday’s judgment also stated: “When considering the imposition of capital punishment, courts must grapple with a complex web of legal, moral, and societal considerations. The principle of proportionality is paramount — the punishment must fit the crime. In cases of extreme brutality and cruelty, where the offence shocks the conscience of society, the argument for the ultimate punishment gains strength. However, this must be balanced against the principles of reformative justice and the sanctity of human life.”","Kolkata court judge Anirban Das’s emphasis on ‘reform’ rather than ‘retribution’ in sentencing rape-and-murder convict Sanjay Roy received support from experts and advocacy groups. “The measure of a civilised society lies not in its ability to exact revenge but in its capacity to reform, rehabilitate, and ultimately to heal,” the judge stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117410932,imgsize-723694,width-400,resizemode-4/117410932.jpg"

Poll Which Measure Do You Think Will Most Effectively Address the Issue of Illegal Immigration? Increased Surveillance and Monitoring Stricter Immigration Enforcement

What do we know about the alleged attacker

Shehzad is a 31-year-old native of Jhalokati district, Bangladesh.

He entered India illegally and adopted multiple identities, including ""Vijay Das.""

He worked in Mumbai for five to six months, employed by a housekeeping agency.

Shehzad allegedly planned the theft but was unaware it was Saif Ali Khan’s residence.

Police have seized evidence suggesting his Bangladeshi origin and are verifying his criminal history.

He was nabbed in Thane.

Court grants 5-day remand; lawyer says proper investigation not done

NEW DELHI: Nearly three days after Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed at his Bandra residence in the early hours of Thursday, the Mumbai Police have arrested the alleged main attacker, Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad , a Bangladeshi national. Following two misidentifications and extensive investigations, police confirmed on Sunday that Shehzad, who had entered India illegally, was using multiple aliases. It was revealed that he had entered Saif Ali Khan's house with the intension of theft during which the stabbing occurred.The attack, which left Khan with severe stab wounds to his thoracic spine, unfolded when the intruder confronted a staff member inside the actor's apartment. Khan reportedly intervened, leading to a violent altercation. Following the incident, the actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to remove a 2.5-inch blade. While Khan is now ""out of danger"" and recovering in a regular hospital room, his condition continues to be closely monitored.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mumbai Police questioned two individuals in separate locations — one in Chhattisgarh and another in Mumbai — but both were later cleared of involvement. The breakthrough came when Shehzad was apprehended in Thane, allegedly while planning to flee to his native Bangladesh, news agency ANI reported.A case has been registered against Shehzad under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including charges for grievous assault and housebreaking, as well as provisions of the Passport Act for his illegal entry into India . During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone 9, Dixit Gedam revealed that Shehzad had been using aliases such as Vijay Das and Bijoy Das, and had worked in Mumbai for the past five to six months in various housekeeping jobs.After his arrest, a Mumbai court granted a 5-day police remand in connection with the attack case. After the hearing, Shehzad’s advocate, Sandeep Shekhane said that the police’s statement — that Shehzad had entered India six months ago — was incorrect, asserting that he had been residing in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. Shekhane also cited a violation of section 43A, claiming a lack of proper investigation into the case.""A police custody for 5 days has been granted. The court has asked the police to submit a report within 5 days. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement.""""He has been living here for more than 7 years. His family is in Mumbai... This is a clear-cut violation of 43A. No proper investigation has been done,"" he said","Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Neyyattinkara sessions court sentenced Monday 24-year-old Greeshma SS to death for murdering her boyfriend, Sharon Raj, in Oct 2022. Judge AM Basheer, who termed the crime “rarest of the rare”, also fined her Rs 2 lakh. Greeshma is the second, and youngest, woman in Kerala to be awarded capital punishment, and the 40th convict on death row in the state. She can pproach HC to challenge the sentence.Greeshma was found guilty of luring Sharon, 23, to drink a pesticide-laced ayurvedic concoction that led to multiple organ failure and, eventually, death. Her maternal uncle, Nirmalakumaran Nair (60), was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for his role in the conspiracy. Her mother, Sindhu, was acquitted last week for lack of evidence.According to the verdict, Greeshma meticulously planned the murder after Sharon refused to end their relationship, which she claimed was causing problems in her life. The premeditation, combined with her attempt to mislead investigators, underscored the gravity of the crime. The court said the prosecution relied on circumstantial, digital and scientific evidence in the case. There were 48 pieces of circumstantial evidence against the accused.The court sentenced Greeshma to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1.5 lakh under IPC Section 364 (kidnapping in order to murder), five years and a fine of Rs 50,000 under Sec 328 (causing harm using poison), and two years under Sec 203 (destruction of evidence or providing false information to protect an offender from legal punishment).Special public prosecutor Vineeth Kumar said Greeshma wanted to end her relationship with Sharon after her family fixed her marriage to an Army man. She later conspired with her uncle and mother to kill Sharon.","Greeshma SS sentenced to death for murdering her boyfriend, Sharon Raj, in Oct 2022.

"In 3rd case of cruelty against cows in Karnataka, pregnant animal dismembered, fetus killed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-3rd-case-of-cruelty-against-cows-in-karnataka-pregnant-animal-dismembered-fetus-killed/articleshow/117409305.cms,"Representative photo

KARWAR: In a horrific case of animal cruelty, a pregnant cow was beheaded, its legs cut off and body ripped open and the unborn calf taken out, only to be mutilated, at Salkod village in Honnavar taluk of Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada district Sunday.This comes close on the heels of udders of three cows being severed in Bengaluru and chopping off a cow’s tail at Nanjangud in Mysuru.The cow belonged to one Krishna Achari, who lodged a police complaint saying the animal was killed between Jan 18 and 19 while grazing outside the village. When Krishna went searching for the cow, he found its dismembered head and legs, and the calf’s mutilated body. He said he had owned the cow for 10 years, and considered it a family member.Police registered a case against unknown persons under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act . Cops are probing if the cow was killed for meat or to instigate trouble in the district.Several bovine killings reported in nearby villages in the district have been attributed to leopard attacks. However, the brutality of Sunday’s attack left local residents shocked and shaken.Local BJP MLA Dinakar Shetty called for swift arrest of the perpetrators. BJP state president B Y Vijayendra and other party functionaries, too, condemned the latest attack on cows and targeted the Siddaramaiah govt, accusing it of having “a soft corner” for such elements.State home minister G Parameshwara has ordered an inquiry into the incident. “We have to find a solution to this. This morning, I gave instructions that we have to take this seriously and we have to identify people who have such a mindset,” he said.On the night of Jan 11, the udders of three cows were mutilated in Bengaluru’s Chamarajpet. Police had arrested a migrant worker from Bihar, Sheikh Nasru, and had claimed he attacked the cows under the influence of alcohol, and he appeared to be mentally unstable. Locals had, however, disputed the police claims.","Pregnant cow was beheaded, its legs cut off and body ripped open and the unborn calf taken out, only to be mutilated.

He allegedly rode a motorcycle on January 9, a week before the violent attack, which was captured by citywide CCTV cameras. The footage played a crucial role in the investigation and led to his identification.The Mumbai Police faced initial challenges in locating the assailant. Various teams were formed to comb through hours of CCTV footage from different locations across the city. Eventually, a breakthrough came when Fakir's former employer came forward and confirmed seeing him riding a motorcycle at a crossing in suburban Andheri, a pivotal lead that led to further investigation.With the help of advanced technology, police traced the suspect’s digital footprint. A payment made by Fakir at a food stall near Century Mill in Worli provided crucial evidence, allowing the authorities to narrow down his location to Thane. A search operation was immediately launched in the area, and Fakir was found lying in a dense mangrove area near a labour camp at Hiranandani Estate.On January 14, Saif Ali Khan was brutally stabbed by an intruder inside his upscale apartment at the 'Satguru Sharan' building in Bandra. The attack required immediate surgery, raising concerns about the security of the actor's residence and the motivations behind such a shocking assault.","Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammad Rohilla Amin Fakir, who had changed his name to Vijay Das, was tracked down following an extensive review of CCTV footage.

"Saif Ali Khan stabbing case: Why wasn’t 'attempt to murder' charge invoked, ask jurists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saifs-why-wasnt-attempt-to-murder-charge-invoked-ask-jurists/articleshow/117407810.cms,"Photo of Saif Ali Khan's attacker

MUMBAI: Legal experts on Monday asked why Mumbai police had not yet invoked the offence of attempt to murder separately against actor Saif Ali Khan ’s alleged assailant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir alias Bijoy Das.“The police can surely add the section under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) even if it has invoked dacoity with an attempt to kill since, going by the allegations of the six stab injuries on Saif Ali Khan, the offence is prima facie attracted,” senior advocate Pranav Badheka said.The accused was booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 311 (robbery, or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 312 (attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with a deadly weapon), and 331 (4) (6) (7) (house-trespass).Later on, sections under the Foreigners Order, 1948, under the Foreigners Act, 1946, were also added as the police said Shariful Fakir was a Bangladeshi national.Badheka said Section 109 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita could well be attracted and invoked by Mumbai police. Since the account of the attack, as seen in media reports, shows the grievous injury caused by the persistent stabbing in the neck and spine areas with the weapon left stuck in the spine, it was suggestive of the injury being serious and “major” as the doctors said and ought to have been considered by the police to invoke the attempt to murder offence.Section 109 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita makes it an offence of attempt to murder if anyone “does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with 10 years’ imprisonment, and if the victim is hurt, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life or to 10 years.”Senior advocate Satish Maneshinde said the police ought to invoke the attempt to murder offence in the case, as ordinarily no burglar would stab so many times. The sheer number of stab injuries and major injuries — half a dozen — is indicative or suggestive of an attempt to kill. Both lawyers and even others practising criminal law said there was also a need to add attempt to murder in the case because, if for some reason the charge of robbery is not sustained, the case may fall flat.","Experts ask why Mumbai police had not yet invoked the offence of attempt to murder separately against alleged assailant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir alias Bijoy Das. “The police can surely add the section under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) even if it has invoked dacoity with an attempt to kill since, going by the allegations of the six stab injuries, the offence is prima facie attracted,” senior advocate Pranav Badheka said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117407838,imgsize-55144,width-400,resizemode-4/117407838.jpg"

MUMBAI: The police said on Monday that they would recreate the series of events leading to the knife attack on Saif Ali Khan while taking care that the actor or his family does not have to mentally relive the trauma of last week’s violent experience.“We have to be mindful that the actor and his family are traumatised after everything that they have been through. All precautions will be taken while recreating the sequence of events at the crime scene,” an officer said.A 150-member police team tracked down the suspect, Shariful Fakir , a Bangladeshi national believed to be living illegally here, from a marshy area at the edge of Thane in a massive combing operation early on Sunday.The police have strong reason to believe that Shariful might have had a prior criminal record in Bangladesh. “He had carried tools used for burglaries such as hammers et cetera, besides the knife. The CCTV footage shows him going up the building without footwear but wearing his shoes on his way downstairs. This indicates he was careful to carry his shoes in his bag on his way up as he had climbed up the pipes,” an officer said.Back in Bangladesh, Shariful has two brothers. His parents also live there. He is not married and has no relatives here. The police have not found any Indian identification documents on him.“A day after the crime, Shariful saw his CCTV images being flashed on television news. He panicked on realising that the police were on his trail. He went into hiding in Thane with plans to board the Geetanjali Express to Howrah and cross the border to Bangladesh,” an officer said.Before Shariful could execute his escape, a police team tracked him down.A team of 75 policemen involved in the case was felicitated on Monday by joint police commissioner (law and order) Satyanarayan.Political attacks over the incident continued, with Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray criticising the Centre and state govt over the Bangladeshi nationality of the suspect in the Khan attack case. Thackeray said that the man turning out to be a Bangladeshi illegal immigrant was concerning.He said the home departments, whether at the Centre or state, were with the BJP for the past decade and the party could not blame anyone else for the illegal immigration problem.“The protection of cross-border illegal immigration is the duty of the union govt, which clearly failed to do so in the past decade,” Thackeray said in a post on X.“Those from any political party, trying to make it a political issue, must actually question the central govt on its failure to curb illegal immigration from Bangladesh. The Centre must release true figures of the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh in our country, and tell us how many they deported in the past 10 years, and what action they’re taking now,” he said.","A 150-member police team tracked down the suspect, Shariful Fakir, from a marshy area at the edge of Thane in a massive combing operation early on Sunday.

Also, the order cited a junior doctor’s testimony, saying an outsider was found sleeping in the “procedure room” on the night of the murder but was driven away by doctors. “This shows there were lapses of security for the doctors,” the court said.“I condemn such attitude of the RG Kar hospital authorities,” the judge declared, calling for accountability and reform in hospital administration to ensure the safety of healthcare workers.",Sealdah sessions court censured former principal Sandip Ghosh and medical superintendent.

Outgoing US President Joe Biden in a significant move during his final hours in office issued pardons for Dr Anthony Fauci , retired Gen Mark Milley , and members of the House committee that investigated the January 6 Capitol attack.The decision aims to protect them from potential reprisals by the incoming administration of Donald Trump.Biden's action follows Trump’s warnings of an ""enemies list"" targeting individuals who opposed him politically or played roles in holding him accountable for his actions related to the 2020 election and the Capitol insurrection. Trump has also nominated Cabinet members who supported his false election claims and pledged retribution against his critics.Dr Fauci, a central figure in the US Covid-19 pandemic response, faced backlash from Trump and his supporters for rejecting unfounded claims and promoting public health measures like mask mandates. Fauci became a polarising figure, with some on the right accusing him of infringing on their freedoms during a time of widespread deaths from the virus.Gen Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also found himself in Trump’s crosshairs. Milley called Trump a fascist and provided details about the former president's conduct during the January 6, 2021, insurrection, further straining their relationship.The pardons reflect Biden’s efforts to shield individuals who might face legal or political repercussions under a Trump administration , which has signaled a willingness to settle scores with perceived adversaries.","Biden issued pardons for Dr Anthony Fauci, retired Gen Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the January 6 Capitol attack.

The attack, carried out by Axel Rudakubana, triggered the UK’s most violent riots in a decade.Rudakubana pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder, and additional charges of producing the poison ricin and possessing an al-Qaida manual. He will be sentenced on Thursday, with life imprisonment likely.The tragic incident occurred on July 29, 2024, when Rudakubana stormed into a dance and yoga class. The victims, aged six, seven, and nine, were fatally stabbed in what authorities described as a ""ferocious attack."" Eight other girls, aged seven to 13, the instructor, and a bystander were also injured.The names of the deceased are Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. Fifteen other girls, some as young as five, were present but escaped uninjured.The killings led to a week of nationwide riots, fuelled by social media misinformation that falsely identified Rudakubana as a recent asylum-seeker. Born in Wales to Rwandan immigrant parents, he had no asylum-seeking history.The riots saw violent mobs targeting mosques, migrant hotels, and police. Cars were set ablaze, and beer bottles and rocks were hurled in clashes across England and Northern Ireland. Over 1,200 arrests were made, with hundreds sentenced to prison terms of up to nine years.Defence lawyer Stanley Reiz said Rudakubana’s mental health would be a factor during sentencing. Prosecutors have yet to establish a clear motive, and police have not classified the attack as terrorism.Rudakubana remained uncooperative during proceedings, refusing to identify himself. His possession of ricin and a terrorism-related manual raised further concerns but has not yet linked him to extremist acts.Since July, the Southport community has struggled to come to terms with the tragedy and its devastating impact.","Axel Rudakubana, 18, pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder, and producing the poison ricin.

A unique celebration

Global presence

Limited tickets

Flags at half-staff

The highly anticipated inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump will take place on January 20, 2025, marking the start of his second, non-consecutive term. Scheduled for noon ET, the event will occur at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. The swearing-in ceremony will begin at 12 pm ET (11 am CT).This inauguration is set to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday, making the historic occasion even more significant. It will be the second time Inauguration Day falls on the same day as MLK Day, with the first instance happening during President Bill Clinton's second inauguration in 1997.Trump’s swearing-in ceremony will officially begin at noon, and shortly after, he will take the oath of office, making him the 47th president of the United States. This marks a remarkable comeback for the 77-year-old, who served as president from 2017 to 2021 and now returns to the White House after four years out of office.The inauguration will also be a day of reflection on the country’s democratic system. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has selected the theme, “Our Enduring Democracy: A Constitutional Promise,” recognising the Founding Fathers' commitment to preserving the continuity of the United States’ government.Following the swearing-in, Trump will join vice-president-elect, who will also take the oath of office. Then, the newly sworn-in president and vice president will participate in the inaugural parade, which will proceed down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Once at the White House, the two will view the parade from a stage at the front lawn.Weather advisories have been issued, with the DC area expected to experience snow and freezing rain. Attendees are warned to prepare for potential delays and disruptions. As this is a national special security event, increased security measures will be in place, with collaboration between federal and local law enforcement.Lawmakers are expected to gather for the certification process of the 2024 election results, which is a formal event but was disrupted four years ago when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. This year, Biden and the Democrats have committed to respecting the election results and ensuring a smooth transition of power.The inauguration is not just a political event; it will also be a celebration of democracy. Once Trump and Vice President-elect are sworn in, the public will see an inaugural address and the traditional pass in review.Although the inauguration is a formal event, Trump’s personal victory rally will take place beforehand. Scheduled for January 19 at Capital One Arena in Washington, the rally is expected to attract a large crowd. With a capacity of 20,000, it’s set to build excitement for the big day.While the details of international attendance remain uncertain, key world leaders have been invited to attend the inauguration. Chinese President Xi Jinping and other international leaders have received invitations, though it’s unclear who will actually attend. One notable absence will be Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will not be present.For those wishing to attend the inauguration, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies makes a limited number of tickets available through members of Congress. These tickets, though free, are a prized opportunity to witness the historic event in person.Another noteworthy feature of the inauguration is the flag protocol. President Joe Biden has ordered US flags to be flown at half-staff in honour of former President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at the age of 100. Trump will be the first president to take office with the flags at half-staff.As Trump prepares to return to the White House, the event will be streamed widely, allowing millions around the world to witness history. This victory marks not only the Republicans’ win over the Democrats and the defeat of presidential candidate Kamala Harris, but also brings hope for both parties working together to strengthen one of the world’s most powerful superpowers.","The inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump will take place on January 20, 2025, marking the start of his second, non-consecutive term.

But then there were communications between Vance's team and the Navy who oversee the residence. Usha Vance spoke with Doug Emhoff for about 40 minutes. The report said childproofing arrangements already started under the watch of Harris.For Harris too, the transition in 2021 was messy and Donald Trump did not acknowledge the election defeat and kept on asserting that the election was stolen.

MUMBAI:After a 72-hour-long manhunt during which suspects were picked up from places as far apart as Mumbai, Virar, Thane and Durg, police finally found the man who stabbed actor Saif Ali Khan early Sunday. He was hiding in a marshy area dotted with vegetation on the edge of Thane city.A 150-member team of Mumbai and Thane police had narrowed down the search on the basis of CCTV footage and a tip-off to Kavesar near Ghodbunder Road.Carrying out a combing operation over shrubland and nullahs through the night, the team found the accused, a Bangladeshi illegal identified as Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, 30, when a policeman shone a torch in a bushy area. Shariful had covered himself with dry leaves to stay concealed.Police had tracked his movements from Bandra to Worli and Thane by trawling through 500 CCTV recordings. Sources said they got a tip-off on Friday from the owner of a manpower supply agency. Jitendra Pandey had provided a housekeeping job to the accused in a restaurant at Worli and later in Thane without verifying his antecedents. Pandey is now being questioned.Shariful had used a fake name, Bijoy Das, to land the job in June 2024. In August, he was sacked from Worli's Slink and Bardot restaurant for theft. Police said Pandey redeployed him in Thane till Dec 15 when the establishment ended its contract with the staffing agency. Out of work, he began carrying out recces for burglary.Police have found a birth certificate, nationality card, and family contact details stored on his phone. Shariful, police said, has confessed to the crime. He planned to burgle a flat in Bandra or Khar as he knew the rich and famous lived in this area. He had no clue that he had entered actor Saif Ali Khan’s house.On Sunday afternoon, he was produced in the Bandra Magistrate’s court, where he was remanded to police custody for five days. Joint Commissioner of Police (Law & Order) Satyanarayan Chaudhari said police have invoked the Foreigners' Act, 1946, and Foreigners' Order, 1948 for illegal entry, alongside Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections for armed robbery against Shariful.A police team scanning CCTV footage looked at visuals from nearly 500 cameras to track the accused. One of the clearest markers in identifying the suspect across locations was the colour and pattern of his shoes. A team led by DCP Dikshit Gedam went through footage from cameras starting from the actor's building going towards Linking Road and Bandra station , then Dadar and Worli before tracking him to Thane. Other members of the team included ACP Adhikrao Pol, Senior Inspector Sanjay Marathe, Inspectors Sachin Rane and Ajay Lingnurkar, Assistant Inspectors Vijay Achrekar, Bajrang Jagtap, Tushar Sawant and staff.After escaping from the actor's flat, Shariful loitered around in the Bandra and Khar locality for almost five-and-half hours before catching a train from Bandra station to Dadar. By then, he had had a haircut, had a bath and changed his clothes. ""When we started scanning through CCTVs, we spotted the accused near Sadhu Vasvani petrol pump on Linking Road in Bandra West where he had changed his shirt. As he knew there were cameras ahead, he crossed the road. But he was captured on cameras at a Khar hotel. After walking for almost an hour-and-half, he slept at Khar station at 4 am before returning to Bandra in the morning and taking a train at 8 am to Dadar,"" said a police officer.""We kept watching the leg and shoe for three hours and finally found the person in CCTV footage near National College. It resembled CCTV images captured at the actor's building. Then we spotted him in camera footage at Bandra railway station and then outside Dadar where he purchased some mobile phone accessories before he boarded a bus to Worli on Jan 16. He walked till he reached Worli Koliwada and stayed in a room where the pub hired by Pandey stayed. ""On Jan 17, in the afternoon, he left Worli and reached Thane and hid in a labour camp before he was arrested,"" said the officer.""He had illegally entered the country before reaching Mumbai. He was in Mumbai and Thane for the past six months and has used different names. We are collecting details about the documents he had created. He moved to Thane a few months ago. He returned to Mumbai 15 days ago before executive the offence. He was working with a housekeeping agency in Thane before he committed the offence and was caught within 72 hours,"" DCP Gedam said.""He was in urgent need of money and planned to rob anyone and immediately escape to Bangladesh,"" said another officer.During the search at Thane, the police team had almost given up hope after combing the area on the city's outskirts through the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. By 2 am, they had scanned 30 to 40 acres of land, comprising a nullah and thorny bushes. The seniors kept egging their juniors on.

‘I have a warm spot for TikTok’: Trump orders a 75-day grace period for TikTok,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-have-a-warm-spot-for-tiktok-trump-orders-a-75-day-grace-period-for-tiktok/articleshow/117411802.cms,"TikTok restored

US President Donald Trump issued a 75 day pause over enforcement of a law that would ban TikTok in the US.This delay marks one of Trump’s earliest moves in office, giving the app a lifeline after it shut down in the US on Saturday due to the ban’s deadline.The law, known as the ‘ Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act ’, came into effect on 19 January and was passed by Congress last year under the Biden administration. The act targeted the distribution and updates of TikTok, citing national security concerns over potential data misuse by the Chinese government.Trump, however, credited TikTok for helping him win over young voters in his election campaign. ""I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn't have originally, but I went on TikTok and I won young people,"" Trump remarked while signing the order.Trump had promised to issue an executive order as soon as he took office to delay the ban and allow time to ""make a deal.""TikTok resumed operations in the US on Sunday, praising Trump’s intervention. The app said, ""We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.""The outgoing Biden administration had previously stated it would not enforce the ban, but the new executive order provides legal clarity to companies like Apple and Google, which were under pressure to remove TikTok from their app stores, failing which penalties of up to $5,000 per user would have been charged in case the app was accessed.The order ensures they will not face penalties for continuing to host or update the app during the pause.Under the directive, the attorney general must issue guidance to service providers and companies such as Oracle, which hosts TikTok’s US servers, confirming they won’t face liability during this period.The 75-day delay aims to provide the new administration with time to negotiate a resolution that safeguards national security while preserving the platform, which has a massive user base of 170 million in the United States.The ban on this short-form-video platform in the US was enforced following a unanimous decision by three federal judges, who dismissed the platform's claim that the law violated First Amendment free speech rights. On 17 January, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected TikTok’s appeal, paving the way for the ban to take effect on 19 January.","US President Donald Trump issued a 75 day pause over enforcement of a law that would ban TikTok in the US.

Donald Trump takes his oath of office as the 47th US president

On the first day of his second presidency, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders including rescinding 78 Biden-era executive actions, giving time to TikTok to avoid ban in US and announcing US' pullout from WHO. The first set of orders were signed at the Trump's inaugural parade.Here's a look at the first set of orders signed by President Donald TrumpIn an effort to preserve the popular social media platform TikTok, Trump signed an executive order extending its operating timeline by 75 days. The order gives TikTok’s China-based parent company more time to find a US buyer, following national security concerns about the platform’s ownership. Trump’s intervention comes after his earlier push to ban TikTok during his first term.The executive order signed by President Donald Trump begins the process of withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), marking the second attempt in less than five years.The order cites the WHO's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its failure to adopt necessary reforms, and its perceived political bias as primary reasons for the withdrawal. It also criticises the WHO's disproportionate financial demands on the US, noting that China, with a larger population, contributes significantly less.The order states that the US intends to formally notify the United Nations of the withdrawal. Trump had previously attempted to withdraw in 2020, but President Biden reversed the decision upon taking office. This new order will go into effect while Trump remains in office for his second term.In a bold move to reshape US immigration policy, Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Justice and Homeland Security to prepare for invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This law could allow the deportation of gang members deemed foreign terrorists. Trump’s order targets criminal organizations such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, which he claims control illegal traffic across the southern border.Trump also reinstated a policy to end federal grants to sanctuary cities and communities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This action aligns with his broader approach to reducing illegal immigration and reasserting federal authority on the issue.Trump revived his efforts to challenge birthright citizenship in the US, an issue that has been part of his immigration agenda for years. His order seeks to end the automatic citizenship granted to anyone born on US soil, a practice enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Though legal challenges are expected, Trump insists that this move will bring the country closer to his vision of stricter immigration control.Trump signed a sweeping execution order on Monday directing the attorney general to ensure states have adequate lethal injection drugs for executions.The order also mandates the pursuit of the death penalty in federal cases involving law enforcement officers or crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Trump's directive comes after a federal execution moratorium imposed under the Biden administration, with only three inmates left on federal death row. The move also aims to override Supreme Court rulings limiting capital punishment.Trump signed an order halting offshore wind lease sales and pausing permits and approvals for onshore and offshore wind projects. Citing environmental concerns and economic costs associated with intermittent electricity generation, this order calls for a comprehensive review of wind leasing practices. Trump’s energy policies aim to promote drilling for oil and gas over renewable energy sources like wind power.Trump signed a memorandum allowing interim six-month security clearances for some of his aides while their federal background checks are pending. These clearances, which grant access to classified government information, will expedite the transition of his staff and ensure they are able to function effectively in their roles, particularly in areas related to national security.Trump made bold statements on international relations with a series of executive orders, including temporarily suspending all US foreign assistance programs for 90 days while reviews are conducted to ensure they align with his administration's goals.In one of his most controversial moves, Trump issued pardons and commutations for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The pardons were seen as a fulfillment of Trump’s campaign promise to release his supporters convicted in the violent attack. This act signals his unwavering support for those who stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the 2020 election certification.Trump began the signing of orders with first eight signed at the inaugural parade before he moved on to sign other orders at the White House.His initial set of orders included revoking 78 Biden-era measures, including protections for sex discrimination, transgender military service, and private prison contracts. He also froze new federal regulations, except for emergency regulations, to reduce federal oversight.Trump imposed a federal hiring freeze, halting the filling of vacant civilian positions with exceptions for military and public safety roles. He also mandated federal employees return to in-person work, ending remote work arrangements.To address the cost-of-living crisis, Trump signed an order targeting rising housing, fuel, and healthcare costs, blaming Biden’s policies. His plan focuses on reducing regulations that increase prices, with agencies required to implement cost-reducing measures.The US also withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, continuing Trump’s 2017 stance. An order to protect free speech was also signed, preventing federal censorship and criticizing previous efforts to limit speech on social media.Trump also aimed to end the ""weaponization"" of the federal government, directing reviews of misconduct by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.","Trump signs executive orders on border, citizenship, TikTok and more.

'We're leaving office, we're not leaving the fight,' Joe Biden says as he thanks his staff

Former President Joe Biden addressed supporters and staff at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Monday afternoon, delivering a farewell speech on the day of Donald Trump 's inauguration. In his speech, Biden emphasized the need for continued efforts and asserted that they're ""not leaving the fight"" even after departing the White house.Biden, 82, spoke as Trump was addressing his own supporters, acknowledging the challenges ahead and the importance of perseverance.""Look, I know from many years of experience, there are ups and downs, but we have to stay with it,"" Biden said, recalling his father's lesson. ""My dad taught me the measure of a person is how quickly they get up when they get knocked down - and that's what we have to do right now,"" he added to his speech.""We never give up - we're leaving office - but we're not leaving the fight,"" he declared, urging his administration members to remain engaged in various capacities, whether in the public or private sector, or even by running for office themselves.Biden expressed gratitude for his team's ""incredible"" work and said serving as their president was the honor of his life. The crowd chanted, ""Thank you, Joe,"" as he concluded his speech before boarding the Nighthawk 46 helicopter with his wife, Jill, to begin their post-presidential life.In his final hours in office, Biden issued a series of presidential pardons , setting a record for any president. He pardoned family members, including his brother James and his wife Sara, his sister Valerie and her husband John Owens, and his brother Francis, in response to what he called ""unrelenting attacks"" by Trump and his allies.Among others pardoned were Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led the US public health response to the coronavirus pandemic, and members of the committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection . On Friday, Biden also announced the reduction of sentences for nearly 2,500 people convicted of non-violent drug offenses and commuted the death sentences of 37 individuals to life imprisonment.","Former President Joe Biden addressed supporters and staff at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Monday afternoon.

Trump secures first cabinet member as Senate confirms Marco Rubio as secretary of state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-secures-first-cabinet-member-as-senate-confirms-marco-rubio-as-secretary-of-state/articleshow/117410500.cms,"Marco Rubio before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing last week

The Senate swiftly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump his first Cabinet member on Inauguration Day. The vote was decisive at 99-0, with Rubio being among the least controversial of Trump's nominees.Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have a swift vote, while action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly, saying he expected voting to begin ""imminently"" on Trump's nominees.""Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable understanding of American foreign policy,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened. It's often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the inauguration to begin putting the new president's team in place, particularly the national security officials.Democrats have calculated it's better for them to be seen as more willing to work with Trump, rather than simply mounting a blockade to his nominees. They're holding their opposition for some of his other picks who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said his party will ""neither rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose nominees that deserve serious consideration."" He added that Rubio is an example of ""a qualified nominee we think should be confirmed quickly.""Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week. Several panels are expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation.The Senate foreign relations committee advanced Rubio's nomination late Monday, while the Senate armed services committee and Senate intelligence committee advanced the nominations of Hegseth and Ratcliffe, respectively.As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation's top diplomat and the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China's rise.During his confirmation hearing, Rubio highlighted concerns about America's ""unbalanced relationship"" with China. While sharing Trump's anti-globalist views, he's recognised as an internationalist who values American global engagement.Rubio anticipates support from both parties. He would succeed Antony Blinken , who expressed hope for continuity in Middle East policies regarding Gaza and Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression.The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives. Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome Democratic opposition to nominees, with objection from any one senator forcing the Senate into procedural steps that would drag voting later into the week.","Marco Rubio confirmed as secretary of state on Monday.

US President Donald Trump on Monday took a potshot at his predecessor Joe Biden for pardoning his family members in the last moments of his presidency.""Did you know that Biden, while I was making my speech, Biden pardoned his whole family? The brother, the whole deal was pardoned. Can you imagine that? While I was making my speech,"" Trump said at the Capitol One Arena.""I think it was unfortunate that he did that,"" he added.Trump's reaction came after Biden pardoned his siblings and their spouses on his way out of the White House saying that his family had been “subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics.”“Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end,” he said as his presidential term was ending.Biden also pardoned Dr Anthony Fauci, retires Gen Mark Milley and the members of the house committee that probed the January 6 attack on the Capitol.Meanwhile, Trump , in one of his first actions for his second term, issued pardons to over 1,500 individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, including leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations.""These are the hostages,"" Trump declared from the Oval Office, referring to the convicted and charged defendants.

US President Donald Trump on Monday returned to the Oval Office as the 47th president of the United States , starting his second term, where he signed groundbreaking executive orders.However, his return to the White House included a moment of levity and tradition.While seated at the Resolute Desk , signing his first set of orders, President Trump was reminded of a long-standing presidential tradition by Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy. The reporter asked whether Joe Biden had left a letter for Trump, a custom observed by outgoing presidents as a gesture of goodwill to their successors.Initially caught off guard, Trump paused, opened the main drawer of the desk, and pulled out an envelope marked with the number ""47."" With a hint of surprise, he exclaimed, ""Oh,"" admitting he might not have discovered the letter for months if not for the reporter's timely reminder.The lighthearted exchange briefly shifted focus from policy to tradition as Trump teased the idea of reading the note aloud to the assembled reporters. Ultimately, he set the letter aside, leaving its contents a mystery for now.","President Trump was reminded of a long-standing presidential tradition by Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy.

In one of the first actions for his second term, US President Donald Trump issued pardons to over 1,500 individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, including leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations.""These are the hostages,"" Trump declared from the Oval Office, referring to the convicted and charged defendants. ""Approximately 1,500 for a pardon – full pardon.""""We hope they come out tonight,"" Trump said.This presidential clemency extends to hundreds previously convicted of serious offences, including police assault and property destruction during attempts to interfere with the power transition process.Justice Department figures indicate over 730 individuals received misdemeanour convictions related to January 6. Additionally, approximately 300 cases remain active as of Monday, with numerous defendants facing serious felony charges, including police assault.The seven-hour siege resulted in injuries to more than 140 police officers and led to the deaths of four Trump supporters and five police officers, both directly and indirectly.The subsequent FBI and Justice Department investigation became the largest criminal investigation in US history, resulting in charges against more than 1,580 individuals and securing approximately 1,270 convictions.Justice Department statistics show that 55% of January 6 prosecutions involve minor offences like trespassing or disorderly conduct. Most convicted individuals received probation or brief prison sentences and have been released.The defendants include elderly individuals caught in the moment and others who briefly entered the Capitol without causing damage or harm. Many lack criminal records, and numerous participants claim they never intended to enter the building or disrupt the 2020 election certification process, with some stating police allowed their entry.Despite Trump's characterisation of January 6 as ""a day of love and peace"" with supporters posing ""zero threat,"" extensive video evidence shows violent confrontations between protesters and police, including attacks with various weapons and physical altercations.According to a report from CNN, Craig Sicknick, brother of US Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick who died following the insurrection, has openly opposed these pardons through a liberal advocacy group's petition, stating it enables rioters to ""evade responsibility.""""Donald Trump and his loyalists not only celebrate the deadly mob that killed my brother — they are determined to pardon those responsible,"" Craig Sicknick said in the message. ""It is a betrayal to not only the families and loved ones of those who were injured and killed but to all Americans.""On Monday, Republican senator Mike Rounds reflected, ""there was violence. This was this was not peaceful. People were in harm's way, and it was a very, very bad day for America."" Whilst acknowledging the president's constitutional pardon authority, he emphasised focusing on the future.","US President Donald Trump issued pardons to over 1,500 individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.
