(Picture credit: Reuters)

MAPUTO : Mozambique votes on Wednesday in a tense general election highly likely to deliver victory to the ruling party, Frelimo , which has governed the Southern African nation since 1975.Four candidates are vying to replace President Filipe Nyusi , who is stepping down after serving two terms. The favourite is Daniel Chapo , 47, a lawyer viewed as a safe choice for business and a fresh face for the long-ruling party.He faces Venancio Mondlane , a charismatic independent candidate who draws huge crowds, former rebel commander Ossufo Momade , and a small opposition party leader, Lutero Simango.Dozens of posters of Chapo's face were pasted along Maputo's palm tree-lined seaside promenade, and red Frelimo flags flew over streets flanked by high rises dispersed with Portuguese colonial buildings. No opposition poster was in sight.Poverty is the major concern of Mozambique's 35 million people, about half of them registered to vote. An Islamist insurgency in the north that has forced thousands to flee their homes and halted multi-billion dollar gas projects also weighs.""The next president must create jobs. We are tired of hearing promises,"" said Amandio Sergio, 32, a small business owner in the seaside capital.Frelimo first allowed elections in 1994 and has since been accused of rigging them, which it denies. Rebel force turned-opposition partyRenamo usually comes a distant second.Mondlane poses a challenge to both this year, but lacks the machinery of established parties and may struggle to win votes in rural areas, analyst Dercio Alfazema said.""This election is different because we have new actors ... (but) Frelimo has a big probability to win,"" Alfazema said.Chapo has experience in local government but has not been tainted by Frelimo's corruption scandals, he added.Counting will start after the polls close at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), although it can take up to two weeks for official results.A disputed outcome would likely trigger protests, which broke out after Frelimo swept last year's municipal elections and were forcefully suppressed.Apathy may dampen them, however.""I feel it doesn't make any difference,"" 26-year-old fisherman Mussa Issufo said of the poll.""Nothing ever changes.""","Four candidates are vying to replace President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving two terms.

(With inputs from agencies)

As Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida 's Gulf Coast, the storm has triggered mass evacuations , fuel shortages, and traffic jams across the state. The Category 5 hurricane, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday. With over a million people ordered to flee, officials have issued urgent warnings, describing the storm as a potentially ""catastrophic"" event, especially for the Tampa Bay area.The storm comes just 12 days after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the state, further exacerbating Florida's vulnerability to Milton’s destruction. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and President Joe Biden have both urged residents in evacuation zones to leave immediately, warning that this could be a life-or-death situation.Officials have mandated the evacuation of over a million people living along Florida’s west coast. The hardest-hit areas are expected to be Tampa Bay and surrounding counties, with residents fleeing ahead of Hurricane Milton's anticipated landfall.Long lines at gas stations and bumper-to-bumper traffic clogged Florida’s roads as residents scrambled to evacuate. According to GasBuddy, around 17% of the state’s gas stations ran out of fuel by Tuesday evening, with some areas experiencing nearly 43% fuel shortages.After briefly weakening, Hurricane Milton regained Category 5 status, with sustained winds of 165 mph. The National Hurricane Center warned that the storm could cause widespread destruction, including a life-threateningstorm surge .Meteorologists are concerned about Milton’s rapid intensification and unusual path, making its potential impact difficult to predict. The Tampa Bay area hasn’t seen a direct hurricane hit since 1921, increasing worries about the storm’s devastating potential.Forecasters predict storm surges of 10 to 15 feet along Florida's coastline, threatening to inundate hundreds of miles of beachfront property. Such surges could level buildings, destroy infrastructure, and endanger lives, particularly in low-lying areas.President Joe Biden postponed international travel to oversee the federal response to Milton, urging Floridians to heed evacuation orders. ""It's a matter of life and death,"" he warned, stressing that staying behind in evacuation zones could be fatal.More than 5,000 members of the Florida National Guard have been deployed, with an additional 3,000 on standby to assist in the aftermath of the storm. These troops will help in search-and-rescue missions and provide essential services in affected areas.Hurricane Milton threatens to disrupt major industries across Florida. Approximately 2.8% of the U.S. gross domestic product is in the storm's direct path, with airlines, energy firms, and theme parks already halting operations in preparation for the hurricane’s landfall.Tampa Mayor Jane Castor urged residents not to underestimate the storm, recalling the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago. “If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you’re going to die,” Castor warned, underscoring the gravity of the situation.Florida’s west coast is still reeling from Hurricane Helene’s impact, which eroded beaches, destroyed dunes, and left infrastructure weakened. The aftermath of Helene has left the state particularly vulnerable to the destruction Milton is expected to bring.","Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday or Thursday.

Diving Accident: Remains of American woman's body found inside Shark's stomach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/remains-of-american-womans-body-found-inside-sharks-stomach/articleshow/114061508.cms,"Colleen Monfore (Picture Credit: X)

The remains of an American woman , who disappeared on a vacation trip, have been discovered inside the stomach of a shark, according to the woman's friend.Colleen Monfore , 68, a retired mom of two from the US state of Michigan , was enjoying vacation — a seven-week diving tour with her husband, Mike — when tragedy struck on September 26. Asia Pacific Press reported that Monfore was diving near the Pulau Reong island off the coast of Indonesia ’s Southwest Maluku Regency when she did not resurface.Two weeks after Monfore disappeared in the tropical waters, a fisherman spotted a distressed shark and killed it, Fox News reported. After cutting open the shark’s stomach, the fisherman found what is believed to be Monfore’s remains along with her wet suit and bathing suit.Initial reports suggested that a shark had killed Monfore and eaten her, but according to Monfore’s friend Kim Sass, this story is likely false.Sass, who wrote on a Facebook post that Monfore was her “very good friend”, and shared what we know so far about the case, and how it is more likely that her friend died because of a medical issue during a dive.A fisherman captured the shark around October 4, near Timor-Leste, a southeast Asian country which is 70 miles away from the dive site where Monfore vanished, Monfore’s remains were identifiable, she added.""Colleen's body was identifiable. Her fingerprints (again identifiable) are being used by our US Embassy and the local government for proof of death,"" Sass wrote. ""This would not be possible if the shark had attacked her weeks ago.""While it can take days for sharks to fully digest a meal, the stomach of a shark ""produces an acid that is strong enough to dissolve metal,"" while ""large bones and other indigestible objects are prevented from going past the stomach due to the small size of the opening to the intestine,"" according to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.Sass believes that the nearly eight-day gap between Monfore's disappearance and the shark's capture indicates that the shark likely consumed Monfore after she had already died.""There was a down current at the turnaround site, but it was manageable,"" she wrote. ""I've easily done 1000+ dives with this gracious woman; she was an excellent diver. I don't believe it was the environment and certainly not a shark that ended her life.""It remains unclear how exactly Monfore died.","Colleen Monfore, 68, a retired mom of two from the US state of Michigan, was enjoying a seven-week diving tour with her husband, Mike.

Supernova music festival, killing hundreds and abducting dozens



NEW DELHI: Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas , which claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people and saw over 100 individuals abducted by the militant group.In a post on X sharing a video, Israel said, ""One year ago, Iran-backed terrorists launched a war to wipe Israel off the map. They slaughtered more than a thousand innocents and took 251 hostage.Every day since, Israel has been working to bring all the hostages home while protecting its citizens and fighting a multi-front war for its very survival.""On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale, surprise assault on Israel, marking one of the deadliest escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent years. The attack coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and significantly intensified hostilities in the region, prompting a swift and aggressive response from the Israeli military.The assault began early in the morning when Hamas, which controlsGaza , fired thousands of rockets into Israeli territory. Cities including Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, and Jerusalem were targeted, triggering sirens and causing civilians to seek shelter.However, the rocket attacks were part of a broader, coordinated operation. Hamas militants breached the heavily fortified Gaza-Israel border, using bulldozers to break through barriers, motorcycles for rapid movement, and paragliders to bypass security checkpoints. The militants entered Israeli communities and military bases near the border, leading to numerous casualties.The attack resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis, both civilians and military personnel. In a shocking development, Hamas fighters took dozens of hostages, including women, children, and soldiers, transporting them back to Gaza. Videos circulated on social media showed hostages being paraded through Gaza’s streets, heightening tensions. The abductions added a layer of complexity to Israel's military response as the safety of the hostages became a critical concern.In a forceful response Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) launched extensive airstrikes targeting Hamas positions, command centers, and weapons storage facilities in Gaza. The Israeli government declared a state of war and mobilised hundreds of thousands of reservists.The IDF sought to regain control of the border areas and eliminate any Hamas militants still operating inside Israeli territory. In the ensuing hours, precision airstrikes aimed to disable Hamas’s military capabilities, though these operations also caused significant destruction in Gaza, leading to civilian casualties.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then addressed the nation and declared that Israel is at war and promised a decisive, prolonged response.He vowed that Hamas would ""pay a heavy price"" for the attack, calling it a ""day of infamy"" for Israel.What began as a night of celebration at Israel's Supernova music festival turned into horror when Hamas militants launched a deadly ambush, firing indiscriminately and abducting dozens of attendees. Organised by Osher and Michael Waknin, the event was intended to promote friendship, love, and freedom but became the site of the deadliest attack in Israel's 75-year history.The festival, which attracted around 3,500 electronic music enthusiasts from Israel and abroad, featured multiple stages, international DJs, and camping facilities. As dawn broke on October 7, the music abruptly stopped when rockets fired by Hamas targeted the venue, signalling the start of the tragic events.Ephraim Mordechayev, a 23-year-old soldier enjoying the festivities, recounted his experience. Initially, he and his friends, used to the occasional rocket launches from the Gaza Strip, did not comprehend the severity of the situation. However, as chaos spread, they realised that armed militants had infiltrated the event, arriving on foot, motorcycles, and even by air, firing automatic weapons at civilians.""There is someone that is 20, 10 metres from you with guns and trying to kill you,"" Mordechayev told AFP.","Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas. The attack claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people and saw over 100 individuals abducted by the militant group. Israel said, ""One year ago, Iran- backed terrorists launched a war to wipe Israel off the map""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114063034,imgsize-2920841,width-400,resizemode-4/114063034.jpg"
Osama bin Laden's son ordered to leave France over 'apology for terrorism' post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/osama-bin-ladens-son-ordered-to-leave-france-over-apology-for-terrorism-post/articleshow/114062121.cms,"French authorities expelled Omar bin Laden , one of late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden son, due to social media posts advocating terrorism , France ’s interior minister Bruno Retailleau said on Tuesday.Omar bin Laden, 43, was born in Saudi Arabia and has also lived in Sudan and Afghanistan before distancing himself from his father at age 19. He later settled in Normandy , France, in 2016, where he pursued a career as a painter.Retailleau, who recently took office as France’s new interior minister, said on X that Omar bin Laden had been residing in the Orne department of Normandy as the spouse of a British citizen.He added that Omar bin Laden “posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that advocated terrorism,” prompting the prefect of Orne to issue an expulsion order.Retailleau said, ""I am today issuing an administrative ban on Mr. Omar Bin Laden, the eldest son of the international terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Mr. Bin Laden, who has lived in Orne for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that were an apology for terrorism. As a result, the Prefect of Orne issued an OQTF and obtained Mr. Bin Laden's departure. The courts have confirmed the regularity of this decision taken for national security. The administrative ban on the territory guarantees that Mr. Bin Laden will not be able to return to France for any reason whatsoever.""“The courts have confirmed the legality of this decision taken in the interests of national security,” Retailleau affirmed. Additionally, the minister signed a ban preventing Omar bin Laden from re-entering France “for any reason whatsoever.” No further details were provided, and it remains unclear whether he has already left the country.Omar bin Laden gained media attention in 2007 when he married British national Jane Felix-Browne, who later adopted the Muslim name Zaina Mohammed.The marriage, marked by the couple's significant age gap, sparked widespread interest. Omar's application to reside in the UK was previously denied by British authorities.Osama bin Laden, the son of a wealthy Saudi construction tycoon, reportedly fathered around two dozen children. He was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011.Retailleau has pledged to tackle issues related to immigration and crime and said that “the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.” His appointment as interior minister reflects the French government’s shift to the right under the leadership of new Prime Minister Michel Barnier, following a hung parliament result in this summer’s legislative elections.","Omar bin Laden, 43, was born in Saudi Arabia and has also lived in Sudan and Afghanistan.

Watch video: Harris campaign casts spotlight on Trump’s 'cozy relationship' with Putin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-video-harris-campaign-casts-spotlight-on-trumps-cozy-relationship-with-putin/articleshow/114062475.cms,"Trump’s interactions with Putin are under renewed scrutiny (NYT file photo)

Vice president Kamala Harris’ campaign released a compilation video featuring former President Donald Trump speaking warmly about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The timing of the release comes just as Trump’s past ties with Putin are once again under scrutiny, with questions swirling about the nature of their communication both during and after Trump’s presidency.The video, likely aimed at raising eyebrows and concerns about Trump's foreign policy allegiances as the 2024 election heats up, showcases several key moments where Trump appears to laud his relationship with the Russian leader.In one of the clips, Trump is heard saying, “And I talked to Putin a lot. I got along with him well,” before he added in another, “I know Putin so well.”Another part of the compilation features Trump congratulating Putin, saying, “I'd like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal. Did you see the deal we've met?”The montage continues with Trump reaffirming his connection, saying, “Oh no, I had a very good relationship. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing. You know what I’m trying to tell people. No, it’s a good thing.”A particularly pointed moment shows Trump alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a visibly uncomfortable exchange. Trump can be seen remarking, ""And I also have very good relationship as you know with President Putin, and if we win, I think we are gonna get it resolved very quickly,"" supposedly referring to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Zelenskyy, caught in an awkward moment, responds, ""I hope we have more good relations,"" to which Trump replies, ""Oh, I see. But you know, it takes two to tango.""These clips, while not new, have gained fresh significance following revelations from veteran journalist Bob Woodward's forthcoming book War, which alleges secret conversations between Trump and Putin. Among the more controversial claims in the book is a reported exchange of Covid-19 testing machines between the US and Russia in 2020—a deal that could have sparked major backlash had it been publicized.Woodward’s book paints a picture of a behind-the-scenes rapport between Trump and Putin, raising the specter of potential Logan Act violations, which prohibits unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.As Trump prepares for the 2024 presidential race, his interactions with Putin could emerge as a major talking point. For many Americans, Trump's stance on Russia has long been a source of debate, especially in light of the 2016 election interference investigations. The Harris campaign appears to be positioning Trump’s past relationships as a central issue of concern for voters.","Kamala Harris' campaign released a compilation video featuring former President Donald Trump speaking warmly about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Authorities in Indiana have arrested two individuals following allegations of child murder . Steven Valle , 31, and Samantha Sebella , 25, face multiple charges, including murder, after police received tips suggesting Valle had confessed to killing and burning his children in a fire pit, as reported by PEOPLE.The investigation began on September 20 when Jasper County officials received a tip from an acquaintance claiming that Valle had admitted to the horrific act at a home in Wheatfield , Indiana.The police quickly located Valle and Sebella at a hotel in nearby Newton County. Although they were cooperative during questioning, they denied any knowledge of the allegations.On September 30, law enforcement conducted a search at a Wheatfield residence where Valle and Sebella were believed to have previously lived. During the search, police uncovered bone fragments from three locations on the property. These fragments have been sent for forensic analysis to determine whether they are human or animal remains.Valle and Sebella were arrested on October 3 as part of the ongoing investigation. In addition to murder, they have been charged with neglect of a dependent causing death, abuse of a corpse, obstruction of justice, and failure to report a dead body. It remains unclear how the couple is linked to the reports of the deceased children, and authorities are working diligently to uncover further details.","Steven Valle, 31, and Samantha Sebella, 25, face multiple charges, including murder.

Thomas Kwan , 53, attempted to carry out his plan in Newcastle , northern England, but his victim survived the ordeal, as reported by CNN.Kwan, a family doctor based in Sunderland , posed as a nurse and even took his mother’s blood pressure before injecting her partner, Patrick O’Hara , with a toxic substance.Prosecutors revealed that O’Hara suffered from necrotising fasciitis , a potentially fatal flesh-eating bacterial infection, following the jab.On Monday, Kwan admitted to attempted murder shortly after his trial commenced at Newcastle Crown Court. He had previously pleaded guilty to administering a noxious substance. Prosecutor Peter Makepeace said during the trial, “Sometimes, occasionally perhaps, the truth really is stranger than fiction.”Makepeace explained that Kwan was motivated by concerns over his mother’s will, which stipulated that her house would pass to O’Hara if he was alive when she died. “Mr Kwan used his encyclopaedic knowledge of, and research into, poisons to carry out his plan,” Makepeace said.To execute his scheme, Kwan checked into a hotel under a false name, used fake number plates on his car, and disguised himself with a wig to appear as a community nurse at O’Hara’s home.","Thomas Kwan, 53, attempted to carry out his plan in Newcastle, northern England.
