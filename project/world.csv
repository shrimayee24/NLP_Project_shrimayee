SC to examine their power to interfere in quasi-judicial functionsNew Delhi: Can parliamentary and legislative committees interfere in the quasi-judicial work of the revenue department? The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine this question arising from the directions issued by a parliamentary committee in the UP Assembly in a land dispute case.Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that multiple directions have been issued by the Uttar Pradesh govt, on the instructions of legislative committees, to revenue officers asking them to take “necessary action” and submit report on the land dispute.“Such directions directly and substantially impinge on free and independent adjudication by the revenue authorities in pending proceedings,” Tiwari said, which prompted the bench to entertain the petition and say that the question of law arising in this case is – “Whether legislative committees can interfere in quasi-judicial functions of revenue authorities?”The issue pertained to demarcation and determination of possession of a plot, which according to the petitioner could be gone into by the competent authority, in this case the sub-divisional magistrate, under the UP Revenue Code.Tiwari said a proper and effective adjudication by the revenue authorities is not possible if there is regular and constant interference from the legislative Committees. He said the Allahabad HC erred by failing to issue appropriate directions to prevent interference by political authorities in the adjudicatory process before Revenue Authorities.The petitioner informed SC that he had filed a complaint before the Assistant Collector, Meja, Prayagraj under section 67 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006 against one R P Shukla, who using his influence, had encroached upon the public lands causing great hardships and obstruction to people in pursuing their agricultural activities.“While the petitioner was diligently pursuing the remedies available to him under the law, questions were being raised in the Vidhan Sabha and directions were being issued by the Secretariat to Revenue Officers asking them to take necessary action and to submit report regarding the land dispute concerning RP Shukla,” he alleged.","SC to examine their power to interfere in quasi-judicial functions.

Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.





BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back. ""She met me again on Saturday around 11 am and expressed severe distress. I summoned the teacher and spoke with both parties. Shortly after she left my office, we heard screams,"" the principal said, adding, ""Internal complaint committee did not find conclusive evidence of sexual harassment.""In the principal's suspension order, the higher education department stated that ""he has failed to perform his duties in the capacity of principal of the college"". It added that ""the matter has not been handled properly"".The principal has been barred from leaving Balsore without the district collector's permission. The accused teacher's suspension order said it was based on ""prima facie evidence"".DIG (eastern range), Satyajit Naik, said the accused faculty member has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide attempt and sexual harassment. A forensic team visited the site, and a detailed investigation is underway. ""Law and order is being strictly maintained on the college campus,"" Naik said.","A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises.

We’ll remember martyrs on any day, if not July 13: Omar

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah climbed over a wall at Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib shrine Monday after police denied entry to him and several cabinet members attempting to pay tribute to the 1931 martyrs at their graves.“I was subjected to physical grappling,” Omar said. “I’m made of sterner stuff. I was doing nothing unlawful or illegal. The so-called protectors of the law need to explain under what law they were trying to stop us.”Authorities had sealed the site a day earlier and placed several politicians, including Omar, his father and National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti under house arrest — intensifying a political standoff between the Union territory’s elected govt and Centre-appointed lieutenant governor’s administration.Determined not to be thwarted again, Omar avoided notifying anyone Monday. The confrontation began after the CM and his ministers headed to the shrine. Blocked by police barricades and CRPF vehicles, he and deputy CM Surinder Choudhary proceeded on foot. Minister Sakina Itoo arrived on a scooter, while Farooq came in a three-wheeler.“They blocked our way with CRPF and police vehicles and even resorted to physical force,” Omar said.He alleged that police tried to tear the NC flag and manhandled party workers.A video shared by Omar shows him scaling the shrine’s wall after being refused entry. “We succeeded in offering prayers,” he said. “They think these graves matter only on July 13. If not July 13, then July 12, 14, or any other day — we will come and remember the martyrs.”Observed as Martyrs’ Day on July 13, the date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside Srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against Maharaja Hari Singh, then Dogra monarch of J&K. The event has become a flashpoint in Kashmir’s evolving identity after Article 370 was revoked in 2019. Since then, police and security forces have been under the direct command of LG Manoj Sinha, while the Omar-led elected government has no authority over law enforcement.Omar quoted BJP stalwart Arun Jaitley to underline the friction. “Democracy in J&K is a tyranny of the unelected,” he said. “The unelected nominees of New Delhi locked up the elected representatives of the people.”Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq rubbed it in. “The CM tasted the bitter medicine of authoritarian high-handedness and experienced what ordinary Kashmiris endure,” he said. “I hope this experience shifts his focus to restoring dignity and fundamental rights.”","J&K CM Omar Abdullah climbed over a wall at Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib shrine.

Six death-row convicts await HC verdict for over 3 yrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/six-death-row-convicts-await-hc-verdict-for-over-3-yrs/articleshow/122476178.cms,"6 death-row convicts await J’khand high court verdict for over 3 years.

HC reserved verdicts in early 2022, yet to pronounce.NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented judicial inaction causing anxiety and uncertainty to those under the shadow of death sentence, the Jharkhand high court had reserved verdicts more than three years ago on appeals filed by six death-row convicts challenging their convictions and capital sentences and is yet to pronounce verdicts.Arguing their appeals filed in the supreme court through its legal services committee against non-pronouncement of judgments for years, advocate Fauzia Shakil told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that it is a serious infraction of the right to speedy justice.Justice Kant asked whether these judgments were reserved by the same Judge who was called out by the apex court on an earlier occasion for similar inaction in delivering judgments. Shakil answered in the affirmative and said though these are 10 judgments which are reserved for a long time, the status report submitted by the HC on delayed pronouncement of verdicts to the SC did not reflect eight of them.Interestingly, in all these 10 appeals – six of whom have been awarded death sentence and rest life terms in murder cases – justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay is the presiding judge of the benches which heard and reserved verdicts in nine cases between Jan 2022 and Aug 2022 and in one in Aug 2023.The death-row convicts are Nitesh Sahu (judgment on appeal reserved on Aug 28, 2022), Sanatan Baski (Feb 3, 2022), Sukhlal Murmu (Feb 3, 2022), Gandhi Oraon (Jan 10, 2022), Rohit Rai (Jan 25, 2022) and Bandhan Oran (Jan 13, 2022).Earlier a similar inaction by the HC in pronouncing judgments in four cases of lifers was brought to the notice of the SC through Shakil and a bench led by Justice Kant had sought a status report from the HC about such cases being kept in limbo. Within a week of the SC entertaining the four cases, the HC had pronounced the verdicts which were reserved for years. Three were acquitted and in one there was a split verdict entitling the accused bail.Shakil informed the apex court that among the present 10 petitioners have been convicted and sentenced to death or life imprisonment. “It is pertinent to note that each one of them has served an actual custody period ranging between over 6 years to over 16 years,” she said.The petitioners pointed out that non-pronouncement of judgments by the HC for more than three years breached the Jharkhand HC Rules, 2001, which provided that “Reserved judgments should ordinarily be pronounced within six weeks of the conclusion of the arguments. In the event of the judgments not being pronounced within three months of the conclusion of the arguments, the chief justice may either post the case for delivering judgment in open Court or withdraw the case and post it for disposal before an appropriate Bench. ”","HC reserved verdicts in early 2022, yet to pronounce. 6 death-row convicts await J’khand high court verdict for over 3 years.

Maoist mines turn Saranda's forest into jumbo killing fields,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoist-mines-turn-sarandas-forest-into-jumbo-killing-fields/articleshow/122476369.cms,"Asia’s largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall

RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: Gunfire didn't ring out in the forest. It cracked with the weight of an elephant's scream. A six-year-old female collapsed near a stream, leg mangled, bleeding into the mud. Four days later, a 15-year-old bull dropped dead deeper in the jungle, a Maoist IED buried under the red soil of Saranda, triggered by a footstep.Asia's largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall. Elephants are walking into Maoist landmines, traps meant for troops. Two deaths in one week. Officials fear more lie wounded and unseen.Search patrols sweep elephant trails and riverbanks. Drones buzz low above watering holes. Five are deployed, but monsoonal rain, foliage and fog obscure visibility. ""We first got wind of a wounded elephant weeks ago,"" said DFO Aviroop Sinha. ""It was only on June 28 that we managed to spot it through drone feed and send help.""Teams are working across four divisions - Kolhan, Porahat, Chaibasa, and Saranda - each step a gamble. ""It's hostile terrain,"" Sinha said. ""Security concerns make it worse.But we've deployed field patrols wherever we can."" IEDs have long turned Saranda's forest trails into minefields. Since November 2022, at least six security personnel have been killed and more than two dozen wounded during combing operations. Maoists and breakaway factions have laid explosives across the forest - old ones buried years ago, fresh ones planted in 2024 and 2025.Civilians aren't spared either. Twenty villagers have died - some while collecting firewood, others while foraging for mahua. In Saranda, every path winds into uncertainty - for soldier, villager, and elephant alike. ""We have no maps, no numbers, no idea how many explosives are buried out there,"" said a forester. ""We just move with caution and gut feeling.""The forest department has begun treating IED-triggered elephant deaths as a conservation emergency. Field teams have been ordered not to enter unknown terrain. Surveillance focuses on riverbanks - likely spots for wounded elephants to rest. But with rain sweeping the region, even drone eyes fail.Regional chief conservator of forests Smita Pankaj said search ops are on high alert. But mobility remains limited. ""We're also planning a joint effort with Odisha's Rourkela and Keonjhar divisions, as elephants use trans-border corridors,"" she said. Just recently, a herd of 40 moved from Saranda to Karampada in Odisha.Wildlife expert DS Srivastava called the elephant casualties unprecedented. ""This is new,"" he said. Srivastava surveyed Saranda between 2015 and 2016. ""Even then, locals told us to avoid human trails,"" he said.Each footstep could be the last for man and wildlife alike. And when a trunk lifts to call for help, the cry often vanishes into the forest - an SOS swallowed by the Sal.","Asia's largest sal forest in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall.

The discovery marks a tragic end to a week-long search operation that began after a suspected suicide note was found at her residence, ANI repoted.Sneha, a resident of South Delhi’s Paryavaran Complex and a B.Sc. Mathematics (Honours) student at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, had reportedly told close friends and family through messages and emails on the morning of her disappearance that she was in emotional distress.According to investigators, Sneha’s family discovered a note indicating her intention to jump off the Signature Bridge. A cab driver later confirmed he had dropped her there on the same day. Technical surveillance placed her last known phone location at the bridge, while eyewitnesses also reported seeing a girl standing alone at the edge of the bridge around sunrise.Moments later, she was no longer in sight.Police registered an FIR at Mehrauli Police Station under Section 140(3) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).A joint operation with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was launched, covering a wide area along the Yamuna, from Nigam Bodh Ghat to Noida.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah was barred Sunday from visiting a graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar, and most of his cabinet colleagues were detained in their homes along with scores of others to keep them away from the site, virtually putting the National Conference (NC) govt under lockdown.Among the other key political figures J&K police confined to their homes were Omar’s father and NC president Farooq Abdullah, former ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone.Omar called the restrictions a “shame” and described “13th July massacre as our Jallianwala Bagh” as he slammed the first such clampdown since his govt took charge in Oct 2024. The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, an arrangement that took shape after the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370.Nasir Aslam Wani, Omar’s political adviser, said the CM had been outside J&K and returned to Srinagar on Sunday but was not allowed to proceed towards Naqshband Sahib, the resting place of 22 people killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh on July 13, 1931. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history.According to Wani, Omar remained in his house after being stopped. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC was in Jammu but his Srinagar house was locked.Wani said he himself had been shut in since 3 am Sunday. “An elected government was placed under house detention in J&K by the very people who hailed the 2024 assembly elections as a triumph of democracy. The irony is not just strange, it is tragic,” NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq told TOI.Omar expressed anger, calling the curbs “blatantly undemocratic” with troops deployed as jailers and major bridges in Srinagar blocked. “I will never understand what the law-and-order govt is so afraid of,” Omar said in a swipe at authorities under LG Sinha.Since early Sunday, authorities shut down major routes. Security was tightened at Gupkar Road, home to top politicians including Farooq, Omar, education minister Sakina Itoo and CPM MLA MY Tarigami. I too posted that she had been “put under house arrest since last (Saturday) night”. The NC head office was sealed with concertina wire. PDP office was shut, too. A popular Sunday flea market in the Lal Chowk area was not allowed. All roads leading to the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib were closed. Senior cops were at the site.Amid the restrictions, Omar sought to counter the established narrative on the 1931 uprising by likening it to Jallianwala Bagh and claiming it was against the British. “The people who laid down their lives did so against the British. Kashmir was being ruled under the British Paramountcy. What a shame that true heroes who fought against British rule in all its forms are today projected as villains only because they were Muslims. We may be denied the opportunity to visit their graves today but we will not forget their sacrifices,” the CM posted.PDP chief Mehbooba called for “acceptance” of the martyrs. “The day you accept our heroes as your own just as Kashmiris have embraced yours, from Mahatma Gandhi to Bhagat Singh, that day, as Prime Minister Modi once said, the dil ki doori (distance of hearts) will truly end,” Mehbooba said. Former PDP minister Naeem Akhtar, also locked in, posted that “it feels like we are in 1931”.In Jammu, the BJP leader of opposition, Sunil Sharma, sought to contest projections of the 1931 episode as martyrdom. He had sparked bedlam in the assembly this March by calling the martyrs “traitors”. “Communal violence was given a false narrative of martyrdom. The recent remarks by Omar, equating Islamist rioters with freedom fighters, are an insult to the nation and its true freedom struggle,” Sharma said Sunday.Deputy CM Choudhary hit back with a veiled jab at the BJP. “If they admire Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, what’s wrong in remembering the July 13 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the rights of people?” Choudhary asked as NC functionaries in Jammu paid tributes.",J&K chief minister barred from visiting graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar. Most of his cabinet colleagues were detained in their homes along with scores of others. Omar called the restrictions a “shame’ and described “13th July massacre as our Jallianwala Bagh’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122423560,imgsize-30674,width-400,resizemode-4/122423560.jpg"

Poll Do you trust the official statements from the Indian Army regarding the drone attacks? Yes, they are credible No, I have doubts

GUWAHATI: Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I, the banned anti-talks faction of the original militant outfit of the same name that he co-founded in 1979, claimed Sunday that three of its senior members were killed in targeted pre-dawn drone attacks by the Indian Army on some ""mobile camps"" in Myanmar's Sagaing region.The Army officially denied carrying out any such aerial attacks on the camps purportedly shared by Ulfa-I and Manipur's Revolutionary People's Front (RPF) across a stretch of the India-Myanmar border, adjoining Longwa in Nagaland and Pangsau Pass in Arunachal Pradesh.Ulfa-I said the attacks came in waves between 2 am and 4 am - involving over 150 drones of Israeli and French make - and resulted in the outfit losing insurgent veterans Nayan Asom, Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom. The last two were killed in the second drone strike while attending Nayan's funeral, while 19 members were wounded, the outfit said.""There are no inputs with the Indian Army on such an operation,"" defence ministry PRO Lt Col Mahendra Rawat told TOI in Guwahati.Ulfa-I contested the statement, specifying that three drone attacks took place in the span of two hours. The outfit said residents of the border belt in Arunachal Pradesh would testify to the attacks.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who started his stint in office with an offer of talks to Ulfa-I, and state police denied any involvement or knowledge of operations against the outfit. They said there could be clarity on Ulfa-I's claim as more information arrives from the remote border.A source in the security establishment confirmed casualties in the Ulfa-I camps in Myanmar, suggesting the attacks could be the outcome of the civil war in that country with several ethnic armed groups at heart of the strife."" The ongoing civil war there has led to frequent clashes, shifting alliances and a general breakdown of state control in many areas, particularly near the international border,"" the source said. ""In this environment, attacks on insurgent camps - including those used by Ulfa-I - could plausibly originate from Myanmar's own ethnic armed organisations, or even the Myanmar military, rather than by Indian forces.""Insurgent outfits of the Northeast have had a presence in Myanmar since the late Eighties, taking advantage of the porous border and ongoing conflict there.Indian security agencies have repeatedly expressed concern over the use of Myanmarese territory by militants for hit-and-run attacks in the Northeast. There have been instances of unconfirmed Indian military action on militants across the border on several occasions.Ulfa-I's camps are said to be in the dense forests of Sagaing, with additional bases at Waktham Basti, Hoyat Basti and Hakiyot (opposite Longding district of Arunachal). Some camps are near the Pangmi Naga-inhabited area, and along the China-Myanmar border. Manipur-based groups, including Manipur outfits like People's Liberation Army (PLA), KYKL and PREPAK. RPF is the political wing of PLA.The NSCN-K(YA) faction has its headquarters and camps in Naga-inhabited regions of Sagaing, often within a 6 to 10km radius of the other militant bases. The locations keep changing, based on what's happening on the Indian side.

From having legs hacked off to getting Rajya Sabha foothold: Sadanandan Master's journey of grit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-having-legs-hacked-off-to-getting-rajya-sabha-foothold-a-masters-journey-of-grit/articleshow/122424644.cms,"File photo: Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: It was May 2016. Speaking at a rally in Kasaragod, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held up the hand of C Sadanandan Master as he lamented the silence imposed on the story of the victim of barbaric poll violence. Coming from a family of hardcore CPM members, the 30-year-old school teacher was influenced by the writings of poet Akkitham and turned into a votary of RSS's philosophy of cultural nationalism. He was dubbed a traitor by his comrades, who punished the defection by hacking off both his legs in 1994. The limbs were mutilated so that they could not be rejoined. The PM breached the ""silence"" on Sunday that he complained about nine years ago by announcing Sadanandan Master's nomination to Rajya Sabha - a move that lakhs of members and sympathisers of RSS would applaud.For, if the atrocity was meant to intimidate him into submission, the attackers failed miserably. Sadanandan, popularly known as Master or 'Maashay', who is now dependent on his prosthetic legs, did not let the gruesome attack deter him from taking on the powerful CPM in their stronghold of Kannur and elsewhere, and propagating Hindutva. Importantly, he has been arguing against the use of violence to settle political and ideological disagreements.If the recognition of Sadanandan Master helps explain his enduring appeal among lay supporters of RSS, the PM gave them another reason to celebrate on Sunday: the nomination of historian Meenakshi Jain. Part of the rare breed that challenged the dominant Left historiography, Jain had to endure resistance and ridicule in academic circles. She, however, earned the admiration of Hindutva circles by detailing the destruction of temples in the medieval period, a taboo area for 'mainstream' historians. Her books - 'Flight of Deities and Rebirth of Temples', 'The Battle for Rama: Case of the Temple at Ayodhya', and 'Rama and Ayodhya' - are evidence of the tenacity with which she pursued her passion. Ujjwal Nikam , the Mumbai lawyer who successfully argued for death penalty for Ajmal Kasab of 26/11 infamy and had earlier argued the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts case, is not known for his links with RSS. Yet, his nomination appears to be part of Modi rewarding those who turn out to be symbols of the cause.Ditto for Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the career diplomat who served as foreign secretary under Modi 2.0. He was seen as BJP's choice for the Darjeeling LS seat in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections before the leadership deferred to the in-house wisdom that the incumbent be retained. The PM may have gone along with the majority view, but did not let the former ambassador slip off his radar.A Leftist-turned-RSS karyakarta, Sadanandan Master's life has been one of sacrifices and a symbol of resilience and unwavering public service in the face of a brutal political attack on him in 1994 in Kannur. For 31 years, Sadanandan Master has been living with these scars when CPM workers severed both his legs, mutilated them on the surface of the road so that he couldn't undergo limb replantation and left him writhing in pain.The brutal attack didn't deter Sadanandan Master as he returned to his teaching job and social service on prosthetic legs. He has consistently spoken out against political violence, especially in Kannur, and has advocated peace and dialogue.""The psychology of violence is that of action and reaction. I am a victim of political violence, and I have always maintained that in my individual capacity, I am willing to take on any role to end this violence,"" he had told TOI in 2016.Sadanandan Master unsuccessfully contested the 2016 and 2021 assembly elections in Kerala on a BJP ticket from the Koothuparambu constituency in Kannur district. Currently, he is the vice president of BJP's Kerala unit.","C Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha.

Heavy rain lashed large parts of the US Northeast on Monday, triggering flash flood warnings across New York City and prompting New Jersey to declare a state of emergency.Rising water levels disrupted roads, airports, and public transport services, reports NBC news.All five boroughs of New York City were placed under a flash flood warning by the national weather service (NWS) on Monday.New Jersey governor Phil Murphy announced a state of emergency “given flash flooding and high levels of rainfall in parts of the state.” He urged residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel.In New York, basement apartment residents were asked to prepare to evacuate at short notice. “If you live in a basement apartment, stay alert. Flash flooding can happen with little warning, including overnight,” New York City emergency management said on X. “Keep a phone, flashlight, and Go Bag nearby. Be ready to move to higher ground.”Rainfall totals reached nearly 1.7 inches in parts of Staten Island and 1.5 inches in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighbourhood by 7:30 pm, and more rain was expected overnight.The NWS warned that rain could fall at rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, with some areas receiving up to 6 inches in total.Transport was severely affected. LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports reported delays and disruptions, while John F. Kennedy Airport warned of potential issues. Substantial flooding shut down sections of major roads.New York City Transit reported flooding at subway stations in Queens.

The European Union Monday accused the US of resisting efforts to strike a trade deal and warned of countermeasures if no agreement is reached to avoid the punishing tariffs President Donald Trump has threatened to impose starting on Aug 1.Trump, meanwhile, said he was open to further discussions with EU and other trading partners before new 30% tariffs kick in next month and that EU officials would be coming to the US for negotiations.""They would like to do a different kind of a deal and we're always open to talk, including to Europe,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office. ""In fact, they're coming over. They'd like to talk."" Trump stepped up his trade war on Saturday, saying he would impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the EU and Mexico next month, following similar warnings for other countries, including Japan and South Korea.EU has so far held off on retaliatory measures to avoid a spiralling tit-for-tat escalation while there remains a chance of negotiating an improved outcome. But EU ministers emerging from a meeting in Brussels Monday appeared closer to striking back.Speaking after the meeting, Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called the tariff threat ""absolutely unacceptable"". EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said he believed there was ""still a potential to continue the negotiations"" but voiced frustration with Washington's failure to agree to a deal with its largest trading partner.He added EU member states agreed the 27-nation bloc would need to take countermeasures if the trade negotiations fail. Italy's foreign minister Antonio Tajani earlier said EU had already prepared a list of tariffs worth 21 billion euros ($24.5 billion) on US goods if they fail to reach a deal.Meanwhile, Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday she believed the two sides would reach a deal on security ahead of the Aug 1 deadline. White House has clarified the 30% tariffs on Mexico, would not apply to goods shipped under the USMCA trade agreement, which covers a vast majority of goods shipped from Mexico to the US. Sheinbaum said any agreement would not involve US forces entering Mexican territory, as previously floated by Trump.

Trump hails decision as ‘major victory’







The US Supreme Court has given the green light to President Donald Trump 's plan to dismantle the federal education department, allowing the administration to move forward with laying off nearly 1,400 employees.In a 6-3 decision on Monday, the justices paused a lower court ruling that had temporarily blocked the layoffs. The order, issued by US District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, had reversed the dismissals and raised doubts about Trump’s broader plan to shut down the department.The high court’s decision now allows the administration to resume one of Trump’s campaign pledges to dismantle the education department and shift its responsibilities back to individual states.The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the majority ruling, expressing concern over the impact of the layoffs and the wider implications for federal oversight of education.The Biden-appointed Judge Joun had previously granted a preliminary injunction against the move, saying it could cause “irreparable harm” to thousands of students and families who rely on federal education services. His ruling questioned the legality of bypassing Congress in shutting down a federal agency and freezing its operations.Trump responded to the ruling on social media, calling it a win for his education agenda. “This is a major victory for students and parents,” he wrote. “The failing Education Department will now go BACK TO THE STATES.”The administration has argued that states are better equipped to manage education without federal intervention and that local control would lead to more effective and tailored learning policies. Critics, however, say dismantling the department could leave millions of students without consistent oversight, especially in underserved communities.","The US Supreme Court has given the green light to President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the federal education department.

STARKE: A man who fatally shot a man and woman outside a Florida bar as part of an attempted revenge killing is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday.Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to death for the murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith.Bell would be the eighth person put to death in Florida this year, with a ninth scheduled for later this month. The state executed six people in 2023, but carried out only one execution last year.Twenty-five men have already been executed in the US this year, tying last year's total.Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma has killed two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee each have killed one.In December 1993, Bell spotted what he thought was the car of the man who fatally shot his brother earlier that year, according to court records. Bell was apparently unaware that the man had sold the car to West.Bell called on two friends and armed himself with an AK-47 rifle, authorities said.They found the car parked outside a liquor lounge and waited. When West, Smith and another woman eventually exited the club, Bell approached the car and opened fire, officials said.West died at the scene, and Smith died on the way to the hospital. The other woman escaped injury. Witnesses said Bell also fired at a crowd of onlookers before fleeing the area. He was eventually arrested the next year.Bell was later convicted of three additional murders. He fatally shot a woman and her toddler son in 1989, and he killed his mother's boyfriend about four months before the attack on West and Smith, officials said.Attorneys for Bell have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court.The lawyers argued in their state filing that Bell's execution should be halted because of newly discovered evidence about witness testimony. But justices unanimously rejected the argument last week and pointed to overwhelming evidence of Bell's guilt in a 54-page opinion.Bell's attorneys filed a similar petition with the US supreme court on Thursday, but the panel has not yet issued a ruling.","Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve.

LOS ANGELES: A growing wildfire at the Grand Canyon's North Rim has now charred at least 50 structures, including a historic lodge inside the popular US tourist site and natural wonder, authorities said Monday.Hundreds of firefighters working from the air and ground in Arizona are battling the so-called Dragon Bravo blaze.More than 500 tourists and park staffers have been evacuated since the fire broke out on July 4, apparently from a lightning strike.On Saturday night the flames intensified quickly due to sustained winds gusting at up to 40 miles (64 kilometres) per hour, the National Park Service said.According to early assessments, the fire has burned down between 50 and 80 structures, including administrative buildings, a water treatment facility, and a historic building called Grand Canyon Lodge.It is the only place on the North Rim inside the park where visitors can spend the night. It was rebuilt in the 1930s after being destroyed in a fire and declared a national historic monument in 1987.Burning for over a week, the fire was initially managed by federal authorities in a confine and contain strategy -- rather than being tackled aggressively to try to put it out.Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has criticized the approach and called for an independent probe.""An incident of this magnitude demands intense oversight and scrutiny into the federal government's emergency response,"" she wrote on X.""They must first take aggressive action to end the wildfire and prevent further damage. But Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park,"" the Democratic governor wrote.Authorities announced the North Rim is now closed for the remainder of the tourism season running through mid-October.Firefighters are also battling a second blaze around 35 miles (56 kilometres) north of the Dragon Bravo fire in Kaibab National Forest.Roads have been closed down too but the more popular South Rim of the canyon remains open.Dozens of fires are burning in the western United States as the country goes into a dry and dangerous season for wildfires.The region faces additional challenges because the Trump administration has cut funding and staff at federal agencies that work to prevent and grapple with fires and other natural disasters.One of the greatest wonders of the natural world, the Grand Canyon is the result of the Colorado River eating away at layers of red sandstone and other rock for millions of years, leaving a chasm up to 18 miles wide and more than a mile deep.Last year almost five million people visited the world-famous site.",A wildfire at the Grand Canyon's North Rim has now charred at least 50 structures.

DENVER: The murder trial of a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife by poisoning her protein shakes and later trying to pay someone to kill the lead investigator on the case will begin with opening arguments Tuesday.James Craig, 47, allegedly used cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient in over-the-counter eye drops, to kill his wife of 23 years, Angela Craig, two years ago in suburban Denver.Craig has pleaded not guilty to several charges, including first-degree murder.Prosecutors say that Craig allegedly purchased arsenic around the time of his wife's symptoms - dizziness and headaches that perplexed doctors - and that after his initial attempts to poison her failed, he ordered potassium cyanide.They also said Craig searched Google for ""how to make a murder look like a heart attack"" and ""is arsenic detectable in an autopsy,"" and that he tried to make it appear his wife had killed herself.Angela Craig, 43, who had six children with James Craig, was hospitalized several times. After the first time, she can be seen on home surveillance video accusing her husband of implying to medical staff that she was suicidal.""It's your fault they treated me like I was a suicide risk, like I did it to myself, and like nothing I said could be believed,"" she said to her husband on the video.After Craig's arrest in 2023, prosecutors alleged that he offered a fellow jail inmate $20,000 to kill the case's lead investigator and offered someone else $20,000 to find people to falsely testify that Angela Craig planned to die by suicide.In addition to first-degree murder, Craig has pleaded not guilty to the other charges, including solicitation to commit murder and solicitation to commit perjury.Craig's attorneys have questioned the reliability of the inmate's claims, said the police were biased against the dentist and that tests of the protein shake containers didn't reveal signs of poison.Around the time of his arrest, prosecutors said Craig was experiencing financial difficulties and appeared to be having an affair with a fellow dentist, though they have not yet described a motive in his wife's death.Craig remains in custody, according to jail records.","James Craig, 47, allegedly used cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient in over-the-counter eye drops, to kill his wife of 23 years, Angela Craig, two years ago in suburban Denver.

'No justification'





BRUSSELS: EU foreign ministers on Tuesday will discuss a raft of options for action against Israel over the war in Gaza, but likely will not agree on any.The bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has put forward 10 potential steps after Israel was found to have breached a cooperation deal between the two sides on human rights grounds.The measures range from suspending the entire accord or curbing trade ties to sanctioning Israeli ministers, imposing an arms embargo and halting visa-free travel.But despite growing anger over the devastation in Gaza, EU states remain divided over how to tackle Israel and diplomats say there appears to be no critical mass for any move.""I was asked to give the inventory of the options that could be taken and it's up to the member states to discuss what do we do with these options,"" Kallas said Monday.The tone of discussions will be shaped strongly by how Israel is implementing a promise to the EU to improve humanitarian access to Gaza.Kallas said Thursday she had struck a deal with her Israeli counterpart, Gideon Saar, to open more entry points and allow in more food.Gaza's two million residents are facing dire humanitarian conditions as Israel has severely limited aid during its devastating war with Palestinian militant group Hamas.""We see some good signs of more trucks getting in,"" Kallas said Monday.""But of course we know that this is not enough and we need to push more (so) that the implementation of what we have agreed also happens on the ground.""At a meeting of EU and neighbouring countries in Brussels on Monday, Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi said the situation in Gaza remained ""catastrophic"".Israel's Saar, speaking at the same meeting, sounded confident his country would avoid further EU action.""I'm sure not any of them will be adopted by the EU member states,"" said the foreign minister. ""There's no justification whatsoever.""While the EU appears unable for now to take any further moves against Israel, just getting to this stage has been a considerable step.The bloc only agreed to review the cooperation deal after Israel relaunched its devastating operation in Gaza following the collapse of a ceasefire in March.Until then deep divisions between countries backing Israel and those more favourable to the Palestinians had hamstrung any move.The war was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which led to 1,219 deaths, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.Of the 251 people taken hostage by militants that day, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry says that at least 58,386 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign.

After suffering losses, he defaulted on repayment of the loan to the financier, identified as Gunasekar.Unable to bear the alleged harassment, the youth asked his father to lend him Rs 10000. Again, a month ago, he asked his father for Rs 34,000. On Sunday, Gunasekhar allegedly went to Ramakanth's place and snatched away his laptop demanding repayment of his loan. Ramakanth then confided in his father about the harassment. He was later found dead on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Chinese university expels woman for 'improper contact' with a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-university-expels-woman-for-improper-contact-with-a-foreigner/articleshow/122479526.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.





A Chinese university said that it would expel a student because she had had ""improper contact with a foreigner"" and ""damaged national dignity,"" after videos circulated online that suggested she had been intimate with a Ukrainian video gamer.The announcement set off heated debate in China. Some commentators applauded the decision and said that Chinese people, particularly women, were too enamoured of foreigners. But others said the expulsion smacked of sexism and paternalism, and compared it to examples of people accused of rape or sexual harassment on campus who had been punished more lightly.Many also criticised the university, Dalian Polytechnic University, in northeastern China, for publicly shaming the student by posting its expulsion notice on its website last week and identifying the student by her full name.""If there is anyone who truly undermined national dignity in this case, it was not the woman whose privacy rights were violated,"" Zhao Hong, a professor of law at Peking University in Beijing, wrote in an opinion column, ""but the online spectators who frantically humiliated an ordinary woman under the banner of so-called justice, and the educational institution that used stale moral commandments.""The university said the student's conduct, in an incident it said took place on Dec.16, had ""caused a negative impact."" It gave no details, but said the student was being punished in accordance with a university regulation about ""civic morality.""That regulation reads: ""Those who have improper contact with foreigners and damage the national dignity and the reputation of the school shall be given a demerit or above, depending on the circumstances.""Chinese social media users quickly linked the announcement to videos shared on that date by a Ukrainian professional video gamer, Danylo Teslenko, who goes by the nickname Zeus. Teslenko, who had been visiting Shanghai for an esports tournament, had posted videos of himself with a Chinese woman to his Telegram channel, where he currently has about 43,000 subscribers.Teslenko has since deleted the videos. Screenshots and recordings still circulating online show the two apparently in a hotel room, with the woman seemingly aware she is being filmed, but do not show any sexually explicit behaviour.In an emailed response to questions, Teslenko said that he deleted the videos when he realized they were spreading on Chinese social media. ""I understood that these clips, although not intimate in nature, were too personal and inappropriate for public sharing,"" he wrote. ""That was my mistake, and I sincerely apologize for it.""Teslenko also addressed the outcry in two posts on the social platform X on Sunday, after news of the expulsion spread. He wrote that he had believed he was sharing ""just a normal moment from life,"" not anything ""disrespectful.""But on Chinese social media, there was general agreement among commenters that there had been disrespect. The only question was by whom.Users who cheered the university's decision said that the woman had shamed China by making it seem as if Chinese women were promiscuous, especially with white men. A tech blogger with 14 million followers wrote on the platform Weibo that ""fawning over foreigners"" would never bring respect, and that ""some mistakes are unforgivable."" Some state media outlets also shared the woman's full name.But others asked why the vitriol seemed to be directed primarily at the woman, rather than at Teslenko, for sharing the videos. (Teslenko frequently makes crude jokes, including about women, online; in posts to his subscribers on Telegram accompanying the Shanghai videos he had indicated that he would show photos of her if his posts drew enough likes.)Other users criticised the university for trying to enforce outdated moral standards. According to the university regulations, other behavior that could lead to censure include listening to music too loudly and any premarital sexual activity.The woman could not be reached for comment. The university did not return requests for comment.Some people also pointed out that Chinese men who post on social media seeking or showing off Caucasian wives are often hailed as national heroes and paragons of masculinity. Others highlighted the case of a male student who was found guilty of rape and put on probation by his university, or that of a male professor who was allowed to keep teaching after sexually harassing students.Some prominent legal scholars encouraged the female student to sue the university for infringing on her rights to privacy and an education.""As an adult woman, whether she has a sexual relationship with others is entirely within her right to sexual autonomy,"" Zhao wrote.Some official media outlets also offered measured defenses of the woman. The Global Times, a tabloid controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, wrote a commentary that said ""problem students"" should be ""guided to recognize their mistakes,"" but in private. Others noted that the expulsion was not final -- the notice said the student had 60 days to appeal but that the revelation of her identity was irreversible.","A Chinese university said it would expel a student because she had ""improper contact with a foreigner"" The announcement set off heated debate in China.

An Israeli proposal to force much of Gaza's population into a small zone in the territory's south has threatened to derail the latest effort to achieve a truce between Israel and Hamas.In recent weeks, Israeli officials have briefed journalists and foreign counterparts on a loose plan to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians into an area controlled by Israel's military close to the Gaza-Egypt border. Legal experts have warned that the plan would violate international law because the civilians would be barred from returning to their homes to the north, a restriction that would constitute a form of ethnic cleansing.While the Israeli govt has yet to formally announce or comment on the plan, the idea of a new encampment in southern Gaza was first proposed last week by Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister. He discussed it at a briefing with Israeli correspondents who focus on military affairs, and NYT reviewed readouts of the briefing written by its attendees. Several attendees also wrote articles that attracted widespread attention among both Israelis and Palestinians.A spokesman for Katz declined to comment on the reports, as did the office of PM Netanyahu Now, Hamas has cited Katz's proposal as one of the latest obstacles to a new truce. During a ceasefire, in exchange for releasing roughly 25 hostages, Hamas wants Israeli troops to withdraw from much of Gaza. The new Israeli plan makes such an outcome far less likely, since it would ensure that Israeli troops remained in charge of a large area over which Hamas seeks to reestablish control.Husam Badran, a senior member of Hamas, described the establishment of the encampment as a ""deliberatively obstructive demand"" that would complicate the fraught negotiations. ""This would be an isolated city that resembles a ghetto,"" Badran said on Monday in a text message. ""This is utterly unacceptable, and no Palestinian would agree to this.""Hopes for an imminent truce rose last week after Netanyahu went to Washington for meetings with President Trump that many expected would result in an Israeli compromise.

Federal scrutiny and protest response



Legal challenges and local response







A major immigration raid at two marijuana farms in Southern California has resulted in more than 360 arrests, a death, and rising tensions between federal authorities and local officials.The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.It has been described as one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office, according to the department of homeland security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem.The DHS executed criminal search warrants at the two sites, with officers in tactical gear storming the greenhouses. The raids sparked confusion and fear among workers and nearby residents, many of whom gathered at the Camarillo location demanding information about their loved ones. One worker, 57-year-old Jaime Alanis, fell from a greenhouse roof while hiding and died two days later in hospital. His niece confirmed his death, noting that he had worked at the farm for a decade and was the sole provider for his wife and daughter in Mexico.Originally, federal officials said around 200 people had been arrested for alleged immigration violations. That number later increased to 361. Among those detained, four had prior convictions including rape and kidnapping.The federal government said it launched the raids to investigate suspected child labour, human trafficking , and abuse. DHS initially said 10 children were found on the property, later raising that number to 14. However, no charges have been filed, and the agency has not released details about the children, their ages, or their activities on site.Glass House Farms began in Carpinteria and later expanded to Camarillo, where it operates both cannabis and tomato greenhouses. State cannabis regulators said no minors were seen during a May inspection. Following a complaint, they reopened an investigation.The raids triggered protests, with tensions flaring between demonstrators and armed agents. Smoke filled the air as crowds clashed with authorities. Federal agents also arrested four US citizens accused of resisting or assaulting officers.The raids come amid growing backlash from immigrant advocates and local leaders. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt broad immigration stops in seven California counties. The justice department has appealed, calling the order vague and difficult to enforce.Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass responded by signing an executive order to support affected communities. The city will work with partners to distribute emergency cash assistance through immigrant rights groups. The funds aim to support residents too scared to go to work or access public services. The city also plans to train staff and establish a police working group to prepare for future immigration actions.Officials say the federal government has not shared the full search warrant or offered evidence to back its claims of trafficking or abuse.","The operation took place last Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.

'They just bombed a nursing home': Trump claims Melania's remarks pushed for stronger action on Russia; US president pledges billions for Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-just-bombed-a-nursing-home-trump-claims-melanias-remarks-pushed-for-stronger-action-on-russia-us-president-pledges-billions-for-ukraine/articleshow/122472961.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Monday said that his wife and first lady, Melania, played a key role in pushing him to take a harder stance against Vladimir Putin over the Russia-Ukraine war.During a meeting with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte at the White House, Trump said Melania had questioned his optimistic view after his phone calls with Putin, who often promised peace talks.“I go home, I tell the first lady, ‘You know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said, ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,” Trump was quoted as saying to reporters. He added that her reaction contributed to his decision to ramp up military support for Ukraine and put pressure on Moscow, reports the New York Post.“We thought we had a deal numerous times,” Trump was quoted as saying to the Daily Beast. “I get home, I’d say, ‘First Lady, I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then I’d turn on the television or she’ll say to me one time, ‘Well that’s strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’”Trump announced that he would commit “billions of dollars” in weapons to Ukraine and warned that his administration would impose harsh tariffs on Russia if there was no ceasefire agreement within 50 days.“We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said, adding, “I use trade for a lot of things. But it’s great for settling wars.”The MAGA chief also said, “We’re going to be doing secondary tariffs. If we don’t have a deal in 50 days, it’s very simple.

What is the Bondi versus Dan Bongino clash?







After a tense weekend amid speculations that Dan Bongino would resign from the post of FBI's deputy director over his clash with Attorney General Pam Bondi, Bongino came to office Monday, CNN reported adding that his future at the FBI still remains uncertain.Bongino had a heated meeting with Pam Bondi in the White House Wednesday. Reports said he stormed out of the meeting and then did ot go to his office for the rest of the week. He told his aides that he would resign if Pam Bondi was not fired. As Pam Bondi was far from being fired, and received praise from President Donald Trump, Bongino's resignation was highly expected over the weekend.Trump was reportedly fuming over Bongino and Vice President JD Vance was asked to mediate between the sparring officials: Pam Bondi, Dan Bongino and Kash Patel.Speculations were rife that Patel too would exit the FBI if Dan Bongino leaves but Patel said he would serve the president as long as Trump wants and is not going anywhere.If Bongino continues in the post, it will be for the times being, insiders believe as his relationship with the White House has become strained after the Epstein drama.“Dan Bongino is a very good guy.

FBI insiders claimed Patel and Bongino would have released the documents long before if they had the power.

California Democrat rep Ro Khanna will file an amendment to an Act that would require Attorney General Pam Bondi to release Epstein's client list as the Donald Trump administration is already in a tough spot over the issue. Khanna said he will file an amendment to the GENIUS Act, a cryptocurrency bill slated to be marked up by the House Rules Committee on Tuesday. Axios reported that the amendment would require Bondi to ""retain, preserve and compile any records or evidence related to any investigation, prosecution or incarceration"" of Epstein.Bondi would then have to ""release and publish"" the records ""on a publicly available website"" within 30 days of the GENIUS Act being signed into law.But it's highly unlikely that Ro Khanna's amendment would make it to the House floor.“Why are the Epstein files still hidden? Who are the rich & powerful being protected?” Khanna wrote on social media Sunday while announcing his plans. A vote would “put every Congress member on record” about making the files public, he continued.Rep. Mark Veasey (D-Texas) also announced on social media that he’ll be introducing a resolution Monday demanding the release of the files.“Either [President Donald Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there!” he wrote, suggesting the possibility of a cover-up.The handling of the Epstein files created a major rift in the Donald Trump administration and FBI deputy director Dan Bongino was on the verge of resigning over his disagreement with Pam Bondi. Bondi overpromised for months about Epstein releases and then the administration announced that Epstein did not have any client list and hence, there would be no more investigation or prosecution in the case.“Dan Bongino is a very good guy.

Mamdani not focused on their backroom deals



'When you get knocked down...'







Dormer Governor Andrew Cuomo who had a crushing defeat in the Democratic primary by Zohran Mamdani decided that he will stay in the election as an independent campaigner, If the polls show that he is not the highest-ranked challenger to Mr. Mamdani by early September, he will pledge to drop out of the race, people aware of the developments said.Cuomo will encourage other challengers, mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Curtis Silwa, the Republican nominee, Jim Walden, an independent candidate -- to do the same.The race is now in favor of Mamdani as Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 6 to 1 margin in New York City, and the winner of the Democratic primary is usually a heavy favorite to win the general election.Zohran Mamdani's spokesperson Jeffrey Lerner said Mamdani is now focused on making New York City more affordable for New Yorkers, and does not care about Cuomo's renewed interest in the race.“While Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams are tripping over themselves to cut backroom deals with billionaires and Republicans, Zohran Mamdani is focused on making this city more affordable for New Yorkers,” Lerner said in a statement to the NYT “That’s the choice this November.”“The general election is in November and I am in it to win it,” Cuomo announced in a video. “Thank you for believing in me, in my agenda and in my experience, and I am truly sorry that I let you down,” he says in the video. “But as my grandfather used to say, when you get knocked down, learn the lesson and pick yourself back up and get in the game, and that is what I’m going to do.

Where is Ghislaine Maxwell now? Is she the only one who can disclose Epstein's client list?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-ghislaine-maxwell-now-is-she-the-only-one-who-can-disclose-epsteins-client-list/articleshow/122459263.cms,"Ghislaine Maxwell is willing to spill the beans on Epstein to put forward her side of the story.

Where is Ghislaine Maxwell now ?



Is Maxwell the only person who can reveal Epstein's client?







Jeffrey Epstein's former aide and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell apparently wants to testify before Congress and put forward her side of the story as she believes she should not have been convicted in the sex trafficking case as a conduit of the disgraced financier Epstein. As the Donald Trump government closed the Epstein investigation,n blocking the way for any further investigation and action, sources claimed that Maxwell was never approached to testify in Congress, which she would agree to do.The revelation has turned a new leaf in the ongoing controversy over the Epstein case as many social media users feared for her life after this disclosure. Epstein's suicide in his prison cell was mysterious and so was the death of Virginia Giuffre, an accuser of the case, earlier this year. Virginia accused Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was 17 and was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell.Maxwell remains at Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee. She follows the jail's fitness routine as she was seen walking and jogging around the track. Since her sentence began three years ago, she has taken on leadership roles at the prison, teaching yoga and etiquette classes and has moved up to the 'honor dorm' for good behavior, it was reported earlier.In 2022, Maxwell, his co-conspirator, was found guilty of five of six counts, including transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, two conspiracy charges and sex trafficking. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring and grooming teenage girls to be exploited by Epstein.Maxwell is considered one of the few people who could reveal the secrets of Epstein. Like Epstein's brother Mark Epstein, Maxwell also believed that Epstein did not commit suicide and was murdered. She lost her appeals against her conviction so far.Now 63 years old, Maxwell is due for release in July 2037.""Despite the rumors, Ghislaine was never offered any kind of plea deal. She would be more than happy to sit before Congress and tell her story,"" the Daily Mail quoted the source as saying. ""No one from the government has ever asked her to share what she knows. She remains the only person to be jailed in connection to Epstein and she would welcome the chance to tell the American public the truth.""","Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of five of six counts, including transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, two conspiracy charges and sex trafficking.

More than 20 states have sued the Donald Trump administration over its decision to freeze over $6 billion in federal education grants, including funds for after-school and summer programs that serve low-income families across the country.The funding freeze has especially hit Republican-led areas. According to an analysis by the left-leaning think tank New America, 91 of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from the affected grant programs are in Republican congressional districts. Half of those districts are in California, West Virginia, Florida, and Georgia.Among the programs at risk is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative, which provides free academic support, enrichment, and child care for 1.4 million children at places like the Boys & Girls Clubs, the YMCA, and public schools.The Trump administration says the freeze is to ensure that the programs receiving funds align with the president’s priorities. The Office of Management and Budget has cited concerns about support for undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ inclusion.In the meantime, programs around the country are struggling to stay open. In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with emergency funds to keep summer camps running. But leaders at the Boys & Girls Club of America warn that without federal money soon, some of their 926 clubs could begin shutting down in the next few weeks.The YMCA and Save the Children also report that many of their centers are at risk of closing.“Time is of the essence,” said Christy Gleason of Save the Children Action Network. Her group supports after-school programming in 41 rural schools across Washington state and the South, where schools start as early as August.Even some Republican officials are voicing concern. Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, a Republican, said, “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,""While some remain hopeful that the administration will eventually release the funds, others worry that delays will leave working families without support and children without safe, enriching environments after school.“It’s not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it,” Gleason said as quoted by AP.","More than 20 states have sued the Trump administration over its decision to freeze over $6 billion in federal education grants.

The Democrat candidate said he would save Minneapolis from hostile White House, increase the minimum wage by $20 by 2028 and stop the police department from interacting with the ICE.Americans shamed him for his looks and asked him to go back to Mogadishu with his 'mud hut ' lifestyle, though Omar Fateh was born in the US; his parents were immigrants from Somalia.""I’m not even going to watch this video.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.
