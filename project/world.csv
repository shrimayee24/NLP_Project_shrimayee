NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday shared cheetah photos to mark International Cheetah Day, calling the animal “one of the most remarkable creatures” on the planet and reaffirming the government’s commitment to its protection.In a post on X, the Prime Minister said Project Cheetah, launched three years ago, was aimed at safeguarding the species and rebuilding the ecosystem in which it can thrive. He described the initiative as an effort to revive India’s lost ecological heritage and strengthen biodiversity. PM Modi also shared photographs of the majestic animal along with his message.“On International Cheetah Day, my best wishes to all wildlife lovers and conservationists dedicated to protecting the cheetah, one of our planet’s most remarkable creatures. Three years ago, our Government launched Project Cheetah with the aim of safeguarding this magnificent animal and restoring the ecosystem in which it can truly flourish. It was also an effort to revive lost ecological heritage and strengthen our biodiversity,” PM Modi wrote.The translocation programme that brought cheetahs from Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana to Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh is considered one of India’s most ambitious wildlife conservation projects.Project Cheetah, rolled out in 2022 to reintroduce the species seven decades after it went extinct due to excessive and reckless hunting, aims to restore a lost ecological niche.To mark International Cheetah Day on Thursday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav is scheduled to release three cheetahs currently kept in enclosures at Kuno into the wild, officials said on Wednesday.The project is being implemented by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department and the Wildlife Institute of India.(With inputs from agencies)",Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday shared cheetah photos to mark International Cheetah Day.

"SC finds way to let lawyer add to earnings, pay maintenance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-finds-way-to-let-lawyer-add-to-earnings-pay-maintenance/articleshow/125755609.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday came up with a unique solution to allow an advocate to pay for the maintenance of his son from his first marriage after the man expressed his inability to do so, citing his second marriage and limited income.The apex court directed that the advocate be assigned two or three cases a month by Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, which provides free legal assistance to poor litigants — an assignment that would help him earn an extra Rs 10,000 every month.The Muslim advocate had divorced his first wife with whom he had a son and married another woman with whom he had another child. The first wife moved Supreme Court challenging the mode of execution of triple talaq and claimed maintenance for her child.Appearing for the divorced woman, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed told a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant she was not contesting his second marriage, though annulment of the first marriage was illegal under Sharia. “She is an educated woman. For the past 36 months, he has not paid a penny towards the maintenance of his son,” Ahmed said.When the bench asked the man to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000 in the interim, the man, through senior advocate M R Shamshad, said he was working as a junior in a lawyer’s chamber and got just Rs 21,000 as monthly remuneration.“He has a wife and a child from the second marriage. Paying Rs 10,000... would ruin his household,” Shamshad said.CJI Kant then asked Shamshad to send the advocate to Supreme Court Legal Services Committee and said he would be assigned two or three cases a month that would earn him Rs 10,000, enabling him to pay maintenance.Ahmed requested SC to consider directing the man to pay a lump-sum amount for the last 36 months. The bench asked the advocate to consider the same and posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 21, when it would also consider petitions by Muslim women challenging the triple talaq custom in Muslim Personal Law and the absence of maintenance provision for women.The women petitioners, many through advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, have challenged Talaq-e-Hasan and all other forms of unilateral and extra-judicial Talaq and sought “framing of guidelines for gender neutral, religion neutral uniform grounds of divorce and uniform procedure of divorce for all citizens”.The SC allowed a plea by advocate Ejaz Maqbool to make Hyderabad-based Sharia Committee for Women a party in the pending petitions. The committee had opposed uniform gender and religion neutral divorce procedure saying it would deprive Muslim women of their right to dissolution of marriage under Muslim Personal Law. It had said every individual shall be held accountable for their actions on the “Day of Judgement” and that concept of divine accountability underscores the balance between rights and responsibilities.","Muslim advocate had divorced his first wife with whom he had a son and married another woman.

"Karnataka CM tussle: Two breakfasts later, Sidda–DKS standoff persists — why it’s a Catch-22 situation for Congress high command",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-cm-tussle-two-breakfasts-later-siddadks-standoff-persists-why-its-a-catch-22-situation-for-congress-high-command/articleshow/125746309.cms,"'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

Sidda vs DKS: A long rivalry

Kurubas and Vokkaligas are considered rival castes in the state. While Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

Siddaramaiah is quintessentially a politician and is not known for his business ventures. Meanwhile, DKS is one of the richest politicians and has many big business interests.

Shivakumar is known for having friends across different parties in Karnataka. However, Siddaramaiah has soured relationships with BJP and JDS.

Fine-tuned caste arithmetic

Future of Congress

Status quo, Siddaramaiah stays full-term

Mid-term power rotation naming Shivakumar the chief minister

Hybrid compromise — phased transition, date announced publicly

Dark horse

Kharge factor

NEW DELHI: A lot can happen over a cup of coffee. But even after two breakfasts between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar , the question over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka still remains unanswered.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.Now, both Siddaramaiah and DKS are looking towards the party high command in Delhi for answers.However, the cleanup task for the party high command is not going to be easy, as this is beyond personalities. The Karnataka tussle contains loyalty, fine-tuned caste arithmetic and the future of Congress in the state.Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar together scripted the victory for Congress in the assembly elections in 2023. While Siddaramaiah's AHINDA (Minorities, backward classes and Dalits) countered Bharatiya Janata Party's Lingayat-Brahmin voter base, Shivakumar was credited for managing the organisational machinery in the party.However, even during the run-up to the elections, the rift between both the leaders was clearly visible. During the campaign, Sidda and DKS were rarely seen together sharing a stage. It was only at the eleventh hour that Karnataka party president Shivakumar met Siddaramaiah to put up a united front and bring supporters of both the leaders together.Despite being the pillars of the party in the state, the leaders are polar opposites.After Congress won in Karnataka, the high command was in a fix over the CM face. After days of deliberation, the party went ahead with Siddaramaiah's name given his seniority and popularity. However, an agreement was reportedly reached that DK Shivakumar would take over the reins in the second half of the government.Recently, DKS confirmed the ""secret deal"" after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.“This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he added.Now after the two and a half years are completed, several seers from the Vokkaliga community are supporting Shivakumar's claim to the chief ministership, emphasising that the community had not held the post since the early 2000s.This has created additional pressure on the party as Vokkaligas have around 13–14 percent share in Karnataka's population, making it the second-most dominant landowning caste after Lingayats.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah, 79 years old, is the tallest Kuruba leader Karnataka has seen. The Kurubas, a significant OBC community forming around 6–7% of the population, have historically lacked an undisputed mass leader until Siddaramaiah built his political philosophy around them.Additionally, Sidda has also built a support base among the AHINDA community, countering the dominance of Lingayats and Vokkaligas.This has added to the dilemma of the high command as picking Sidda would mean sidelining Vokkaligas and going with DKS would mean looking over the AHINDA and Kurubas.Amid the ongoing tussle over the chief ministerial post, the danger of losing majority in the Vidhan Soudha is looming over Congress government's head.There are 23 Vokkaliga MLAs in the grand old party who are supporting DKS. In a scenario where the Congress high command decides to continue with Siddaramaiah as the chief minister, these MLAs who are openly backing DKS can pull out support from the government.Meanwhile, 9 Kuruba MLAs and 34 Lingayat MLAs are supporting Siddaramaiah, making the CM tussle a Catch-22 situation for the high command.With the decision window narrowing, Congress leadership now has three realistic options:This route maintains continuity, protects AHINDA influence, and sends a signal of stability. A cabinet reshuffle may be sanctioned later as compensation to placate those backing Shivakumar.Backers of DKS see this as honouring commitment and preventing factional drift. But replacing a sitting CM at the midpoint could cause internal rupture if not managed delicately.A future-dated swap could satisfy both camps temporarily, provided the timeline is seen as credible and binding. It is the most politically pragmatic formula but only works if both factions stand down simultaneously.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party floated another theory that Congress may ignore both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar and choose a “dark horse” for the chief ministerial post in the state.Talking to reporters, former Karnataka CM and BJP MP Basavaraj Bommai said that chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DKS are “being inflexible due to their ego,” leading the high command to consider alternative options.“CM and Deputy CM both have a very egoistic attitude. They are not ready to budge an inch. Therefore, the high command is compelled to think of the other alternative. So in this context, a dark horse might emerge in the state,” Bommai said.Amid the ongoing developments in the state, all eyes are now on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge who may be the only one with a solution for this deadlock.Kharge, who also hails from Karnataka, is one of the most seasoned functionaries in the state. First elected to the state assembly in 1972, Kharge won nine consecutive elections until 2008, earning the nickname ‘Solillada Sardara’ (the undefeated chieftain).Acknowledging the power tussle between the CM and his deputy, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.","Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Wednesday landed in Delhi amid the ongoing tussle with Siddaramaiah over the top job in the state.However, he refuted reports that he is visiting Delhi to the Congress high command, saying that he is in the national capital to attend a wedding.""No political agenda.

A rally held in Bhopal on Wednesday to mark 41 years of the Bhopal gas tragedy turned tense after BJP supporters alleged that protesters were preparing to burn an “RSS effigy” along with one representing Dow Chemical, the current owner of Union Carbide.The rally was organised by four survivor groups and began at Bharat Talkies, but it was stopped midway following the dispute. The march was meant to pass the city bus stand and end at the gas memorial near the closed Union Carbide factory in JP Nagar, where protesters planned to burn the effigies.Assistant police commissioner Rakesh Singh Baghel told PTI that a complaint was received during the rally about an effigy that looked like it depicted workers of a particular organisation. After verifying the complaint, police removed the effigy, saying some people found it offensive. Baghel warned that any attempt to target an organisation or ideology would lead to action.""If any attempt was made to create a controversy at the rally, strict action will be taken,"" the police officer maintained.RSS worker and BJP mandal president Ashish Singh Thakur claimed the effigy showed an RSS “sevak” and accused protesters of planning to burn it. He called it “anti-national” work and demanded a case against those involved. Survivor groups rejected the charge and said their effigies represented people responsible for the 1984 disaster, not any group.The gas leak on the night of December 2–3, 1984, killed at least 5,479 people and left thousands injured.

RAIPUR: A daylong gunfight on the Dantewada-Bijapur border in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region left at least 12 Maoists and three District Reserve Guard (DRG) personnel dead Wednesday, marking one of the year’s heaviest losses for the outlawed group as security forces pressed deeper into the insurgency’s crumbling stronghold,Another DRG constable was wounded but was said to be out of danger.

'Leader Is Bulldozing': Kharge, Nadda Lock Horns Over TMC MP's Speech In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: The joint opposition Wednesday protested at the Parliament entrance against new labour codes and demanded their scrapping, with Congress president and leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge targeting the Modi govt as “anti-labour, anti-worker, pro-cronies”.Kharge said the codes pose a “threat to job security” as the layoff threshold without govt approval has been raised from 100 to 300 workers. He said the new provisions will end permanent jobs as companies will hire workers on short-term contracts to avoid long-term benefits for workers. He said states can allow 12-hour shifts through flexible scheduling, even though eight-hour shifts are retained on paper.“Workers must wait 60 days before striking, plus a 14-day cooling-off period. This prevents quick action against unsafe or unfair conditions. Requiring one union with 51% membership to be the sole negotiator sidelines smaller unions and reduces representation for diverse worker groups,” he said.Carrying posters and placards against the new labour codes, the opposition MPs raised slogans demanding their rollback.Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi; TMC’s Dola Sen; DMK’s Kanhimozhi and A Raja; CPM’s John Brittas and Amra Ram; CPI(ML)’s Rajaram Singh and Sudama Prasad; MPs NK Premachandran, Amar Singh, Gaurav Gogoi, among others, were part of the protest.They held a large banner — ‘No to Corporate Jungle Raj, Yes to Labour Justice’.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said govt had snatched all the rights of workers in the name of simplifying laws and bringing labour codes. “Through these laws, Modi’s pro-capitalist and anti-worker mindset has again come to the fore. The country does not accept these laws,” she said.","Congress president and leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge targeting the Modi govt as “anti-labour, anti-worker, pro-cronies’ Kharge said the codes pose a “threat to job security” as the layoff threshold without govt approval has been raised from 100 to 300 workers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125752763,imgsize-67028,width-400,resizemode-4/new-delhi-dec-03-ani-rajya-sabha-lop-mallikarjun-kharge-speaks-in-the-house-.jpg"

BENGALURU: A 45-year-old techie's dream of building a house ended on a sad note as he died by suicide, accusing a family and officials of the erstwhile BBMP, now Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA), of abetting his extreme act through harassment.Murali Govindaraju, a resident of Brookbong Layout in Whitefield, worked with a private software company at ITPL. The father of two minor girls was found dead in his under-construction house at Nallurahalli Wednesday morning.Police arrested Shashi Nambiar (64) and his wife Usha (57), on charges of abetting the suicide and are looking for their son, Varun. The couple was produced before a magistrate and remanded in 14-day judicial custody.Police recovered a 10-page death note, which accused the Nambiars of abetting his suicide through harassment. According to the note, the family, along with a few GBA officials, tortured him, stating he violated the rules by not constructing the building according to the approved plan and repeatedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to hush up the matter.Murali's mother, Lakshmi Govindaraju (61), filed a criminal complaint at the Whitefield police station against Shashi and Usha, accusing them of trying to extort Rs 20 lakh from her son, torturing him for refusing, and abetting his suicide.Lakshmi alleged the Nambiars encouraged GBA officials to harass Murali. Police booked Shashi and Usha under sections 108 (abetment to suicide) and 308 (extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Murali had purchased the land at Nallurahalli from a close relative of the Nambiars in 2018. ""When my son began constructing a house on the land, Usha and Shashi started harassing and torturing him. They repeatedly demanded Rs 20 lakh from him. When my son refused, Usha complained to BBMP officials, who came near the construction site and harassed my son. My son told me that today (Wednesday) was the deadline to pay Rs 20 lakh. My son told me that Usha and Shashi were torturing him. Bearing this in mind, he left our house (Brookbong Layout) around 6am. He reached the under-construction house and hanged himself on the second floor. I seek legal action against Usha Nambiar and Shashi Nambiar for abetting my son's suicide through harassment,"" according to his mother's complaint.GBA officials had issued a notice to Murali, directing him to appear before them Wednesday. ""Investigations, so far, revealed that Usha approached BBMP, accusing Murali of violating the approved plan. Accordingly, BBMP, after making a spot inspection, issued a notice. The spat between Murali and the Nambiars dated back to 2018, when he purchased the land measuring 40x60 sqft. The Nambiars, for one reason or another, fought with Murali and made him run around the BBMP office, police station, and local court. The couple allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to stop harassing him,"" police said.A senior police officer said many locals accused the Nambiars of extorting money by filing cases against them in BBMP/GBA.

Harassed, Tortured And Repeatedly Threatened

BENGALURU: The relentless pressure of a neighbourhood dispute, a looming civic notice, and a Rs 20-lakh demand he said he could not meet — a combination that pushed a 45-year-old techie to end his life inside the very house he was trying to build.Hours before his scheduled appearance before Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) officials, Murali Govindaraju was found hanging on the second floor of his under-construction home in Nallurahalli on Wednesday morning, leaving behind a 10-page death note accusing a neighbouring family and civic officials of driving him to suicide.Murali, a software employee at ITPL and father of two minor girls, lived in Brookbong Layout, Whitefield. Police have arrested his neighbours Shashi Nambiar (64) and Usha (57) on charges of abetment and are searching for their son, Varun. The couple has been sent to 14-day judicial custody.According to police, the contents of Murali’s lengthy death note mirror the allegations in a criminal complaint filed by his mother, Lakshmi Govindaraju (61). She stated that her son had been “harassed, tortured and repeatedly threatened” by the Nambiars, who allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to stop accusing him of plan violations.She said Murali told her that Wednesday was the deadline the couple had set.Murali had bought the 40x60 sqft plot in 2018 from a close relative of the Nambiars. The relationship soured soon after construction began, with Usha and Shashi repeatedly accusing him of deviation from the approved plan. Lakshmi alleged that when Murali refused to pay, Usha lodged complaints with BBMP officials, prompting them to visit the site frequently and harass him.On Wednesday morning, Murali left home around 6am, telling his family he was under pressure and that Usha and Shashi were “torturing” him. He went to the under-construction house and killed himself.Police have booked the couple under Sections 108 (abetment of suicide) and 308 (extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). A senior officer said preliminary inquiries show the Nambiars had filed multiple complaints since 2018, making Murali “run around BBMP offices, the police station, and local courts.”GBA officials confirmed they had issued Murali a notice asking him to appear before them on Wednesday. “Usha approached BBMP alleging violations. After a spot inspection, BBMP issued a notice,” the officer said. “The couple allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh to stop harassing him.”Police said several locals have now come forward alleging that the Nambiars regularly filed complaints to extort money under the pretext of activism. “People in the area say many homes have faced similar harassment,” the officer said. “We request all affected residents to file complaints.”The friction between Murali and the Nambiars began soon after he purchased the land in 2018 — a conflict that, according to investigators, escalated over the years and ended with a devastating outcome.","Murali Govindaraju, a 45-year-old techie from Nallurahalli, died by suicide on Wednesday.

An F-16 fighter jet assigned to the US Air Force Thunderbirds, the service’s elite aerial demonstration team, went down Wednesday morning in a Southern California desert.The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Officials said the jet went down around 10:45 a.m. during a training flight in controlled airspace.Video posted to X by DisasterAlert shows the pilot making what appears to be a lucky escape, drifting slowly toward the ground beneath a parachute.Later military officials said the pilot ejected just before impact and survived.The pilot was listed in stable condition and is receiving medical treatment, Staff Sgt. Jovante Johnson, an Air Force spokesperson, confirmed in an email Wednesday, New York Times reported.A wide plume of dark smoke was visible after the plane went down near Trona Airport in San Bernardino County. The jet was part of the US Air Force Thunderbirds, the military’s official aerial demonstration team, according to the social media post. The cause of the crash remains unclear.The approximate cost of a US Air Force F-16C Fighting Falcon is around $20 million. “A Thunderbird pilot ejected safely from an F-16C Fighting Falcon aircraft during a training mission over controlled airspace in California,” a release from the US Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron said.The Thunderbirds operate out of Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas, roughly 200 miles east of where the crash occurred.The team is renowned for its high-risk aerial stunts and razor-sharp precision, thrilling millions of spectators since its formation in 1953.During certain maneuvers — with names like the opposing knife-edge pass and the delta loop — the F-16 jets fly as close as 18 inches apart.","The jet went down around 10:45 a.m. during a training flight in controlled airspace.

Nick Yardy, Jade and Dani continue “Throuple” relationship after fake pregnancy reveal





Nicholas Hunter, better known online as Nick Yardy, is a 29-year-old YouTuber from South Florida who is famous for posting comedy skits and wild story-style videos. He has more than three million subscribers on YouTube and millions more on Instagram and TikTok. This year, he shocked the internet again, but this time it was not because of a prank or a joke. It was because of a claim that made millions of people stop and stare.In February 2025, Nicholas Hunter said he was going to be a father to two babies at the same time. He said the mothers were a 22-year-old creator named Jade and her 44-year-old mother Dani. The news exploded online and turned into one of the most confusing and talked-about stories of the year.Earlier this year in February 2025, Jade posted on social media that both she and her mother were expecting Nick Yardy’s children. She said she was carrying a girl and her mother was carrying a boy, only two weeks apart.The news spread everywhere, with people reacting in shock and disgust. Many users left comments such as “this cannot be real” and “this is upsetting,” and several news outlets, including E! News and NDTV, reported on the bizarre claim.On March 7, 2025, Yardy told MailOnline the truth. He said, “There are no babies. It’s just a skit. It’s not actually real.”He explained that his followers enjoy entertainment, and the pregnancy story was created only for views. He also said he did not expect people to believe it so strongly.Even after the confession, Jade and Dani kept posting vintage ""pregnancy"" pictures on social media despite Yardy's already public assertion that the tale was fabricated.There is no record of a genuine pregnancy or birth right now, in December 2025. Renewed coverage from the New York Post, E!, and NDTV validates the staged pregnancy with never any babies involved.Yardy, though, maintains that his love connection with both Jade and Dani is genuine and still going on.Also Read: Does Candace Owens Have Facts To Support Her Emmanuel Macron And Charlie Kirk Claim?

Allie Beth Stuckey pushes back on Candace Owens’ claim





Candace Owens made a strong claim about Charlie Kirk . She said Charlie Kirk was “betrayed” by people inside Turning Point USA. She wrote on X that she is “fully confident” about this. She also said she will soon share proof and name the people she thinks hurt him. Owens told people who gave money to Turning Point USA that they should ask for a refund because “leadership knew.”Charlie Kirk, who was a well-known American political activist, was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” talk at the campus when the shooting happened. After his death, Donald Trump said Charlie had once told him he might run for president one day.Owens’ new claim has brought a lot of attention because many people loved Charlie Kirk. Many want to know what she will say next. Many also want to see the proof she says she has. There is also tension inside the Turning Point USA community. This is because some people close to Charlie do not agree with Owens.A Christian influencer named Allie Beth Stuckey spoke out against Candace Owens. She talked about it on her show, Relatable. Stuckey said she did not want to answer Owens in public at first. But she said she felt hurt when Candace Owens suggested she “did not care” about who killed Charlie Kirk.Stuckey wrote on X that she cares deeply and wants the truth. She also said that “just asking questions” does not allow people to spread wrong claims.Allie Beth Stuckey said she wants Christians to look for truth in a fair way.

She has also appeared on the Charlie Kirk Show since his passing.While Allie Beth Stuckey spoke gently, Candace Owens made an even bigger claim. She said, “Charlie was betrayed. By everyone.” Her words have shocked many people who followed Charlie and his work.After Charlie Kirk’s death, his wife Erika Kirk became the new CEO of Turning Point USA.

Trump Gets Personal With Congresswoman Omar After DC Ambush | 'Came Into US By Marrying Her Brother'





: In a late-night digital outburst that stretched from 7 pm to nearly midnight on Monday, U.S President Donald Trump flooded Truth Social with more than 160 posts—one of the most intense social-media barrages of his presidency – igniting questions about his governing priorities and mental acuity,The 79-year-old president posted at a pace that at times exceeded one message per minute, transforming his preferred platform into a real-time display of grievances, boasts, and conspiratorial claims. He followed it up with a three-hour cabinet meeting on Tuesday afternoon during which he appeared to nod off as his minions lavished him with praise in a spectacle of sycophancy unusual for America.Monday evening began on a light note: a repost of Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2 captioned, “Christmas is officially GREAT again!” But the tone quickly shifted to a torrent of political attacks. Trump accused former President Joe Biden of abusing an “autopen” to sign executive orders, pardons, and federal contracts, declaring them “null, void, and of no further force or effect.” Among the documents he claimed to invalidate were high-profile pardons for Dr. Anthony Fauci and General Mark Milley – assertions that could invite new legal disputes.According to an Axios review, roughly 60% of the 158 tracked posts (excluding duplicates) were reposts amplifying MAGA allies, while about 30% were original commentary and 10% multimedia. The themes were familiar but frenetic: vows to “permanently pause migration,” attacks on Democratic lawmakers including Ilhan Omar and Nancy Pelosi, and accusations that Democrats orchestrated the January 6 attack or engaged in voter fraud.Interspersed throughout were lavish tributes to First Lady Melania Trump and praise of his own economic record. The feed frequently looped misinformation and fringe content, including videos from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and claims that Michelle Obama wielded Biden’s autopen for secret pardons.The result was a disjointed stream of consciousness that lurched from election fraud tropes to reminders about a Tennessee special election, resembling a late-night venting session more than presidential communication.The volume far exceeded Trump’s typical output. Roll Call Factbase data shows he averaged 25 posts per day in November, with occasional surges approaching 50. Monday night’s total of 158 posts in under four hours surpassed his August 2024 “rigged election” blitz (112 posts) and his inauguration-week rally in January 2025 (89 in one night).Also read: 'Excellent overall health': White House releases Donald Trump's MRI exam amid speculations Since 2022, Trump has logged more than 12,000 Truth Social posts, but no previous session matches manic Monday. The deluge renewed speculation about staff involvement or automation, though Trump insisted he was posting personally, signing off at 5:48 a.m. Tuesday with: “TRUTH SOCIAL IS THE BEST! There is nothing even close!!!”Globally, Trump’s hyperactivity places him in a category of one. World leaders generally post sparingly and with institutional restraint. PM Narendra Modi, considered prolific, typically posts 5-6 times a day. France’s Emmanuel Macron averages two to four Instagram updates per month; Even Ukraine’s wartime messaging—10 to 15 daily Telegram updates from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy—pales in comparison to Trump’s blitz. Social media analysts note that Trump’s unfiltered style makes him an outlier among the 5.4 billion global social users who now scroll an average of more than two hours a day.Reactions were sharply polarized. Trump supporters celebrated the blitz as evidence of vitality, with MAGA influencers hailing the spree as “major transparency.” “BRING ON THE ARRESTS!” one user cheered in response to Trump’s autopen decree. But late-night hosts mocked the “shitposting” — “Do you know how long you have to be on the toilet to post that much?""Jimmy Kimmel joked. Trump's ""thumbs were as swollen as his ankles,"" jibed Jimmy Fallon. And from Jon Stewart: ""At 79, Trump's out here posting faster than a TikTok teen on Adderall.""But it was no laughing matter for more serious commentariat. The Guardian questioned the president’s judgment. Even social media influencers who spend much of their time online were gobsmacked by the frenetic posting. “If you had a family member or friend doing this, you’d intervene,” one critic noted.","President Donald Trump posted more than 160 times on Truth Social on Monday night.

Migrant family’s nightmare in Nagpur: Mother jailed for killing rapist contractor; daughters raped as cops handed them to abusive father,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vicious-cycle-of-trauma-woman-kills-contractor-during-rape-bid-hubby-rapes-minor-daughters-in-mothers-absence/articleshow/125752270.cms,"NAGPUR: In a tragic chain of events that exposed the brutal reality of countless migrant women in India, a 35-year-old woman and her 17-year-old son are fighting for survival after being jailed for murdering a contractor, who tried to rape her at a construction site where she worked in mid-June in Kuhi police limits.While the mother languished behind bars, her abusive husband, who tormented the family for years, sexually exploited their two minor daughters in the 12-9 age-group for three months. ""With a murder stigma, I am not getting work. I am anxious about my children's future,"" said the woman who got bail after district legal services authorities (DLSA) extended assistance, a fortnight ago.A handful of transgenders in the neighbourhood, ensured the two minors were rescued and the father handed over to the Wathoda police, who charged him under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) in October this year. ""My husband was a liquor addict, womaniser, and wife-beater. I requested rural police (Kuhi) not to give my two daughters custody to my husband. The cops assured me they would keep a watch on my husband and take care of my two daughters. But nothing happened, and both my minor daughters were sexually assaulted for three months,"" said the woman, sobbing inconsolably.The woman, married off at a tender age of 14 in Delhi, became a mother of four children in quick succession.Relentless domestic violence forced her to flee the national capital with her children and reach Nagpur in December 2024, hoping for a fresh start, at the behest of a cousin. She and her elder son soon found daily-wage work at a construction site in Kuhi area.Tragedy struck on the eighth day of work. The contractor dragged the woman to an isolated spot and tried to rape her. ""It was unexpected,"" she said. As she fought back, her 17-year-old son rushed to the scene and joined in the struggle to save his mother. In the melee, the contractor suffered severe injuries. Panic-stricken, the mother-son duo fled, but the contractor succumbed to his injuries.Kuhi police swiftly arrested the woman and sent her to Nagpur Central Jail and her minor son to a govt observation home. In a decision that proved catastrophic, police contacted the woman's estranged husband in Delhi and asked him to come to Nagpur to take custody of the remaining three children. The man assured the authorities he would care for them.What followed was horror. Back in their temporary shelter, the father began raping his daughters. The crime continued for nearly three months until his 14-year-old son accidentally witnessed the act. Shocked and enraged, the boy immediately raised an alarm. A neighbour, alerted by the commotion, sought help from transgenders living nearby. The community sprang into action and overpowered the man and dragged him to Wathoda police station. The two traumatised girls were immediately shifted to a govt shelter home for safety and counselling. ""We arrested the father. The formalities for monetary benefits under the Manodharya scheme for rape survivors are already being processed,"" said senior inspector Harish Borade of Wathoda police station.The District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) intervened in the mother's case. After sustained legal efforts, both the woman and her son were granted bail. But freedom brought little relief. Branded as a ""murder accused,"" the woman is being shunned by her locality. No one is ready to offer her work. With no income, she cannot even afford a bus fare to attend court hearings.Today, the shattered family is scattered. The two exploited daughters remain in the govt shelter, undergoing trauma counselling. The elder son too has walked off the observation homes now and is trying to find work, but being a minor, he doesn't get any livelihood. And the mother is battling stigma, poverty, and unimaginable emotional scars.

Why Hindi becomes a flashpoint on Mumbai locals? Teen's death sparks big political storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/why-hindi-becomes-a-flashpoint-on-mumbai-locals/articleshow/125758042.cms,"Why Hindi becomes a flashpoint on Mumbai locals

language during his commute. While the financial capital remains a melting pot, it’s the nature of travel on the local train that’s under lens for sparking discord over lingo

Jostling for elbow room

Tracks prepare the ground

The suburban tinderbox

The politics of language

Inputs from Vishal Rajemahadik

What was once routine jostling over space on Mumbai’s lifeline — its suburban railway network used by close to 70 lakh commuters every day — has turned into a flashpoint over the contentious issue of language. Barely months after a ‘Hindi vs Marathi’ debate raged in the city over the state govt’s move to make Hindi mandatory in schools from class 1, it reportedly claimed the life of a 19-year-old student.Arnav Khaire, a first-year BSc student from Kalyan, died by suicide on Nov 18 after he was assaulted on a local train by commuters for speaking in Hindi and not Marathi, his father alleged. The trauma caused by the incident led him to end his life, his family says. Khaire was a Marathi-speaking youngster who chose to speak in Hindi while travelling on a local train.If the lingo he adopted underscored the cosmopolitan nature of public spaces in the metropolis, his death has highlighted how tensions over language that keep simmering in India’s financial capital have increasingly started boiling over on cramped suburban trains, where tempers can run short. And even as a probe into the allegations is on, Khaire’s death has triggered a big political controversy in Maharashtra.While BJP has been holding demonstrations against Shiv Sena (UBT) and Raj Thackeray’s MNS in and outside Mumbai for fomenting hatred along linguistic lines, the opposition maintains that the incident should not be mixed with the recent agitation against “imposition of Hindi”.Street violence against “outsiders” in the name of the ‘Marathi manoos’ is not new: it has been a feature of the city’s politics since 1966, when Bal Thackeray formed the Shiv Sena. In recent decades, it’s his nephew, Raj, who has been aggressive on the issue of Marathi language and identity. His party, MNS, has openly targeted North Indians and, for a time, his cousin and Bal Thackeray’s son Uddhav seemed to be lagging behind in upholding the Sena’s ‘root cause,’ especially when the Uddhav-led undivided Sena walked out of its alliance with BJP and formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi in 2019 with Congress and NCP.In the middle of this year, a policy decision of the Devendra Fadnavis-led govt making Hindi a compulsory third language in schools from class 1 caused an uproar and sparked fresh debate over the status of Marathi language, with the estranged Thackeray cousins launching a joint anti-Hindi campaign. Its stridency brought three results: the state govt was forced to shelve its move; the issue of Marathi returned to the centre stage; and Uddhav and Raj came together, bringing ‘Marathi’ back into political currency ahead of local body elections, which began on Dec 2.Any ‘anti-Hindi’ sentiment may not be immediately visible on the surface in a famously multi-cultural city. However, talk of Marathi-speaking families moving out of Mumbai to the far-flung suburbs — nativist parties claim that “Marathis are being pushed out of Mumbai” — is seen as contributing to a charged political environment, where the potential of channelling youth energies into targeted violence remains very much intact. Amid all this, it is the daily, stressful and near-breathless commute — especially to and from the far-flung suburbs — that’s become fertile ground for resentments to rise.Data show that these suburbs are where crowds are the highest on the local train network, making space constraints worse and the commute increasingly trying.Post pandemic, Central Railway’s daily ridership has climbed back to 41 lakh, though it’s still short of the pre-pandemic level of 44 lakh. Of these, 26 lakh commuters use the main line, and about 45% of them come from north of Thane, underscoring the extreme congestion in Mumbai’s satellite townships such as Kalyan, Dombivli, Thakurli, Ambarnath, Badlapur and Titwala.Western Railway averages 31 lakh passengers a day, compared to 35 lakh before the pandemic. Here, too, nearly 30% of commuters come from the Borivli-Virar belt, highlighting the continuing pressure on the northern suburban corridor.Kailash Verma, vice-president of Maharashtra BJP’s railway cell, said, “Fights on trains have been common. What’s changed is that every small argument is now recorded on mobile phones and circulated on social media, making it seem like these incidents have suddenly increased.”On language-related tensions, he added, “Those who go around asking commuters to speak in Marathi are merely foot soldiers of political parties that have lost elections and are now looking for scapegoats.”Lata Argade of Upnagariya Pravasi Maha Sangh said rising office stress and uncontrolled crowding is fuelling these flare-ups. “Work pressures have gone up so much that the average commuter is already stressed before stepping into the station. Crowds have increased to the point where people often manage to board only after 3-4 attempts. And, once someone finally gets in, it’s so packed you can’t even move your arms. All this naturally leads to more arguments and frequent flare-ups inside trains.”Commuters also pointed out how, earlier, most passengers travelled light, but post Covid, many carry shoulder bags with laptops, chargers, etc, making manoeuvring inside a packed coach far more difficult. That can make even the simple act of turning sideways or adjusting one’s grip a trigger in case a bag hits fellow passengers or blocks their standing space.Notably, such arguments rarely take place on public buses, howsoever crowded, or in more leisurely settings like parks and gardens, where people from different backgrounds similarly converge. Clearly, the discomfort and irritation of a long commute is more of a palpable trigger on a local train.A professor who travels daily by train from Kalyan to Bhandup on the Central Railway network said altercations linked to language have become routine. “Particularly those who travel in groups every day tend to target some passengers who speak in Hindi. Earlier, arguments mostly happened due to pushing or over seats. But, now, if someone speaks in Hindi, they are taunted with remarks like, ‘Don’t you know Marathi?’, ‘Are you new to Mumbai?’ or, ‘Why do you outsiders come here and crowd the place?’”He added that many commuters ignore such comments, but when someone responds or protests, the matter can escalate into scuffles. Most incidents, he noted, never reach the police because passengers are in a hurry and prefer to avoid formal complaints.Another commuter, who works at a law firm in CST, said altercations were most common on the CR line between Kalyan and Ghatkopar during peak hours. General conversation once took place in Hindi, but “nowadays more passengers insist on speaking in Marathi”.A clash occurred at Nalasopara station last week when a commuter identifying himself as Sunny Chavan shot a video that subsequently went viral. In it, he is heard saying that while boarding a local he asked a fellow commuter to stop pushing, to which the person replied in Hindi that these things happen. That sparked an argument that was recorded by Chavan. He’s heard asking the other person to speak in Marathi, and the man replies in Hindi, “Is it necessary/compulsory to know Marathi if I am staying in Maharashtra?” An acquaintance of the other man is also heard telling Chavan on the video, “I don’t know Marathi. ” He asks Chavan thrice, “So what if one doesn’t know Marathi?”A senior Govt Railway Police (GRP) official in Mumbai said the law says that an FIR can be registered only if a cognisable offence is made out. If an argument over language snowballs into a scuffle among passengers, relevant sections of assault would be applied under provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, depending on the gravity of injuries suffered by the complainant.Academic and activist Deepak Pawar, who led the protests against the ‘Hindi language’ move in schools earlier this year, said Khaire’s suicide was unfortunate and that those guilty in the case must be punished. However, he alleged, “Parties like BJP are trying to politicise the issue ahead of BMC elections. They are trying to blame those that supported the protests against Hindi imposition, like MNS and Shiv Sena (UBT). We have not supported violence in the name of language. But the BJP ecosystem portrays pro-Marathi activists as responsible for the incident and demonises them.”MNS functionary Sandeep Deshpande said the allegation that Khaire died by suicide over the Marathi language issue is only based on his father’s complaint, and it would be premature to come to any conclusion. “Let the police investigate. The complaint is only based on a conversation the father had with him. MNS has not supported random violence in the name of Marathi language. Our actions have only been reactionary when Marathi is insulted. If people insult Marathi in Maharashtra, there is a spontaneous reaction,” Deshpande said.BJP, however, argues that it is the anti-migrant hate engendered by the Sena (UBT) and Raj’s MNS that created the atmosphere leading to the assault on Khaire and his subsequent suicide. Congress, for its part, has said that it is the BJP which is “polariser no.1”. The Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, which is with BJP, has sought to balance things by asserting the importance of Marathi language and condemning assaults and hate in the name of language.On the crowded locals, though, the balancing act, never easy, has gotten more difficult.","Arnav Khaire, a first-year BSc student from Kalyan, died by suicide on Nov 18 after he was assaulted on a local train by commuters for speaking in Hindi and not Marathi, his father alleged. The trauma caused by the incident led him to end his life, his family says.

Dallas of Telangana: Ankapur votes for the future; sarpanch seat comes with 10-year blueprint in ‘self-reliant’ village,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dallas-of-telangana-ankapur-votes-for-the-future-sarpanch-seat-comes-with-10-year-blueprint-in-self-reliant-village/articleshow/125757981.cms,"TOI

Self-governance model

A village shaped by NRIs

Even as contestants across Telangana battle fiercely for sarpanch posts in the ongoing gram panchayat elections, Ankapur village in Nizamabad district stands apart — a place that, in many ways, runs its own parallel govt.Ahead of the elections,visited Ankapur, about 180 km from Hyderabad, and found that the sarpanch election is far more than a routine local body poll — it is a contest that shapes the village’s long-term trajectory.Here, the sarpanch’s role is not merely administrative; it carries the weight of steering one of the state’s most model villages with a vision at least 10 years ahead.According to Ankapur villagers, four contestants — G Gangaram, N Ramana Reddy, P Naveen, and A Devender — are likely to be in the fray this time, and nominations would be filed on Friday.“The sarpanch can’t take unilateral decisions. The village community has the final say,” says KK Bajanna, a village elder.Since Ankapur funds a large part of its own development through community contributions and the village development corporation (VDC), the sarpanch needs to work alongside this body to forecast future needs. As a result, the contest has become intensely competitive, attracting candidates with deep roots in the community.“A sarpanch cannot think only about the next one or two years. Our village is changing fast, and the sarpanch has to be someone who can imagine what Ankapur will look like in 2035,” said K Ganga Reddy, president of VDC, Ankapur.On the other hand, what distinguishes Ankapur is its near zero-dependence on the police. “Be it small disagreements or larger conflicts — issues are settled internally through community discussions, elders’ intervention, and mutual compromise. Even when someone goes to the police station, officers often send them back and tell them to resolve it internally,” said G Chinna Rajanna, former sarpanch of Ankapur in the 1980s.Adding to its unique identity, Ankapur is known as ‘Mini America’. Almost one in every three to four families has at least one member settled in the US — a trend that began nearly two decades ago, just when IT was picking up in Hyderabad.“Out of around 1,200 families, nearly 400 live in the US, mostly in Dallas and California. In fact, many Ankapur families in Dallas even live in the same neighbourhood, mirroring the social fabric of their native village,” said I Rajender, a villager.",Ankapur village in Nizamabad district runs its own parallel govt.

"In Mumbai’s smallest ward, old lanes & old problems linger amid push for revamp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-mumbais-smallest-ward-old-lanes-old-problems-linger-amid-push-for-revamp/articleshow/125757658.cms,"B Ward, the city’s smallest with just two corporator seats -- both held by Congress in the last election -- is home to some of Mumbai’s oldest residential and commercial pockets. In neighbourhoods like Bhendi Bazaar, Dongri, Masjid Bunder, Mohammed Ali Road and Mandvi, many buildings date back nearly a century. Some are creaky and dilapidated, while others have begun making way for redevelopment. Yet, amid this churn, one problem remains stubbornly unchanged: the constant accumulation of garbage in the ward’s narrow ‘house gullies’.Residents say the choked lanes are a hygiene hazard, with little sign of a lasting solution.Politically, the ward has been a Congress stronghold. In the 2012 municipal polls, all three corporator seats of the then-larger B ward went to the party. The last assembly elections saw Congress veteran Amin Patel win the Mumbadevi seat for the fourth consecutive time, while the Lok Sabha constituency returned Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Arvind Sawant for a third straight term.Currently a small portion of one of the corporator ward falls under the Colaba assembly which is represented by BJP MLA Rahul Narwekar.Patel points to civic issues such as low water pressure. He said that with no corporators for over four years now, these issues are taken to the MLA, who has been raising them repeatedly with the BMC administration.“The population of the ward has increased over the years, yet residents continue to receive the same amount of water they did decades ago. On top of that, there is low water pressure. How will this suffice?” he said.Along similar lines, Mohammed Imran K Gujarati, president of the NGO Brotherhood Medical Aid and Welfare Foundation that operates in the Nishanpada area of Dongri, said they are regularly informed about lowpressure water supply in the ward and have no option but to make do with it. He also pointed out that parking along the road has become a major problem in the area. “Most of the buildings in this locality that are being redeveloped are not providing residents with an adequate number of parking spaces, because of which people then park on the road.The roads in this ward are already so narrow that in an emergency it can be very difficult for a fire tender or ambulance to enter. Older buildings -- some of which are nearly 100 years old -- do not have adequate parking space, so at the very least, new buildings should be constructed with proper parking facilities.”Masjid Bunder resident Sarita Midbaokar, a BJP party worker, said that the opening of Sindoor Bridge -- earlier known as Carnac Bridge -in July 2025 brought relief to locals. “The bridge is a keyeast-west link in south Mumbai, but was declared structurally unsafe by Central Railway and dismantled in Aug 2022. Its absence caused major disruption to traffic between P D’Mello Road and the commercial belts of Crawford Market, Kalbadevi and Mohammad Ali Road. When it finally reopened, it came as a godsend,” she said, adding that after the bridge opened, there were some issues regarding traffic movement as the bridge descended towards the Masjid Bunder area, which were resolved through the interventionof local BJP MLA Rahul Narwekar.Yusuf Rangwalla, trustee of Saifee School who has his office in Masjid Bunder and is also the BJP ward No. 224 president, said the accumulation of garbage is a huge concern but will require a change in behaviour from locals as well. “It’s not fair to expect civic staff to collect garbage that is strewn throughout the day,” he said. “Another issue in the ward has been the rise in the number of hawkers, especially in pockets that are already heavily congested. ”","B Ward is home to some of Mumbai’s oldest residential and commercial pockets.

Pakistan On Boil As Imran Khan Supporters Defy Crackdown Amid Rumours Of Death And Deep Isolation





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan claims Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan.

‘Greatest scandals of all time’: Scott Bessent rips NYT for alleged Trump’s ‘fake’ health report; publication hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/greatest-scandals-of-all-time-scott-bessent-rips-nyt-for-alleged-trumps-fake-health-report-publication-hits-back/articleshow/125756260.cms,"'Throw Her Out': Trump Reignites Ilhan Omar 'Married Her Brother' Controversy; Targets Somalians





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent launched a sharp attack on The New York Times at the paper’s own DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday, accusing it of running “distorted” coverage of President Donald Trump’s health while failing to confront questions about former President Joe Biden’s decline.In an onstage exchange with Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bessent said the paper was losing credibility and predicted, “You know, in 20, 30, 40, 50 years, the New York Times is no longer the paper of record,” according to reports from Mediaite. Calling the publication a “fever swamp,” he added that he no longer reads the Times himself, as cited by NYP.Bessent was responding to a Times report that said Trump, 79, had “shorter public days,” later starts and moments in which he appeared fatigued during meetings. He dismissed the story as fabricated: “I read this article, like ‘President Trump is slowing down. President Trump’s mental capacity –’ It is a hundred percent fake. Like he only called me twice at 2 in the morning last week instead of three times.”The Times article also said Trump now holds fewer public events than he did during his first year in office and travels domestically at a slower pace. It cited instances in which Trump’s eyes “drooped” during midday meetings and mentioned undisclosed medical procedures.Bessent countered that a lengthy Cabinet meeting this week showed an engaged president and accused the paper of overlooking the administration’s pace of work.He broadened his criticism to Biden-era coverage, calling it “one of the greatest scandals of all time” and alleging a “cover-up” of Biden’s condition.Sorkin pushed back, arguing their were concerns about the Biden's coverage and the scrutiny had been lacking, it meant examining Trump’s health and rasing questions about it was “probably fair.”Bessent rejected the comparison, saying the Times was inventing narratives: “Where was the New York Times? We just had a three-hour cabinet meeting yesterday, Andrew!” He questioned how anyone could “invoke the 25th Amendment” if cabinet secretaries seldom met Biden.The exchange came even as the Times reported strong business performance in the last quarter, with more than 12 million subscribers - almost all digital - and nearly half a million new digital-only subscribers added.Speaking later on Fox News, Bessent said he had to fact check the journalist as such reporting will not let people have coorect constuct of ""great second Trump presidency.""“As I got there he immediately went into attack and I just couldn’t take the hypocrisy of it all... I don’t read the Times anymore but people send me articles and the last couple of articles I have got are so far from truth and I think how are people gonna construct narrative of this great second Trump Presidency in an accurate way when a paper of supposed record is so far off.”","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent launched a sharp attack on The New York Times at the paper's own DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday. He accused it of running ""distorted"" coverage of President Donald Trump's health while failing to confront questions about former President Joe Biden's decline. He predicted that in 20, 30, 40, 50 years, the Times is ""no longer the paper of record""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125757094,imgsize-919175,width-400,resizemode-4/scott-bessent-at-nyt-event.jpg"
'Kill all' for 'martyrdom': How Pakistani immigrant allegedly planned to attack US University of Delaware police campus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kill-all-for-martyrdom-how-pak-immigrant-allegedly-planned-to-attack-us-university-of-delaware-police-campus-details/articleshow/125756393.cms,"Source: New Castle County Police

Who is Luqmaan Khan?







A Pakistan-origin man studying at the University of Delaware was arrested after police discovered a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour, along with a manifesto that allegedly described plans to ""kill all"" and seek ""martyrdom"" in a mass shooting on the University campus, The New York Post reported.Police arrested 25-year-old Luqmaan Khan just before midnight on November 24. Officers found him sitting in his pickup truck in a park after closing hours, and decided to search the vehicle because he was acting suspiciously.Inside the truck, officers allegedly found a .357 Glock pistol, several loaded 27-round magazines, body-armor plates, binoculars, a laptop and a marble composition notebook. Prosecutors said the pistol had been placed into a kit that turned it into a semi-automatic rifle.The police also recovered a notebook reportedly describing a plan to attack his former school’s campus police department, including a drawn-out map of the police headquarters with marked entry and exit points. The plan included evading law enforcement team after attack.ABC 6 reported that the writings included phrases like “kill all – martyrdom,” explained how to escape after the attack, and described how several weapons would be used.Police said the notes clearly showed “premeditated assault plans” and “warfare techniques.”The exact reason for the planned attack is still unknown, but Khan allegedly told police after his arrest that becoming a martyr was “one of the greatest things you can do.”“This case is a quintessential example of federal and state law enforcement collaborating to neutralize a grave threat to Delaware before the worst could come to pass. I want to thank our dedicated law enforcement partners at the FBI and the NCCPD for their exceptional work. As always, we are proud to work with them to keep Delaware safe,” said Acting US Attorney Murray.One campus police officer was specifically mentioned in the notes, but the reason is not yet known.Police told The Post that Khan was born in Pakistan but has lived in the United States since he was a “youth,” and he is now an American citizen.After his arrest, the FBI searched his home in Wilmington and found even more weapons. Agents recovered an AR-style rifle with a red-dot scope and another Glock pistol, which had an illegal device that turned it into a fully automatic machine gun capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute.Khan was taken to the New Castle County Police Headquarters and charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, multiple weapon violations and related offenses.He was arraigned, given a $107,200 cash bail, and then handed over to the FBI, which may file additional charges.","Luqmaan Khan, 25, was arrested after police found a large collection of guns, ammunition and body armour in his truck.

‘Not all of us are criminals’: Immigration sweep in New Orleans intensifies; officials aim for maximum arrests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-all-of-us-are-criminals-immigration-sweep-in-new-orleans-intensifies-officials-aim-for-maximum-arrests/articleshow/125755962.cms,"



US immigration officials began an operation in New Orleans on Wednesday to arrest immigrants in the US illegally, federal officials said, making the city the latest target of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration.The Department of Homeland Security said the operation would focus on criminal offenders released from local custody under city policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, Reuters reported.Trump, a Republican, had ordered similar operations in Democratic-led cities across the US, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., in a bid to drive deportations to record levels.The office of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the New Orleans Police Department.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a Republican, has supported federal immigration enforcement efforts and reiterated his backing in a Wednesday interview with local radio. Landry’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Residents and local officials in cities targeted by the immigration crackdown have pushed back, saying Border Patrol and ICE agents have swept up many people with no criminal record and have used heavy-handed tactics that endangered residents.In one family-owned restaurant in New Orleans, a woman assembled makeshift beds so family members could sleep there to avoid potentially being profiled by federal agents while travelling between home and work. The woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Abby, said her family came to the US from Mexico two decades ago but that she and others have not been able to obtain legal status. She said she worried that she could be arrested by immigration authorities and separated from her 10-year-old son, a US citizen. ""Not all of us are criminals,"" she said. ""We're hardworking people. We're people who get up early to achieve our goals and fight for our dreams.""The Latino population in the New Orleans metro area rapidly increased after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. Many undocumented Latino migrants flocked to the city to help rebuild in the wake of Katrina’s destruction, immigrant rights groups say, and now comprise upward of 20% of residents in Jefferson Parish, directly to the west of the city proper, according to Census data.Members of immigrant rights group Union Migrante posted videos and photos showing Border Patrol agents questioning workers and making arrests at home improvement stores across the New Orleans metropolitan area.Union Migrante volunteer Rachel Taber said Border Patrol agents told her to stay back 25 feet as she recorded them questioning roofing workers at a home in the Kenner area of New Orleans on Wednesday. ""I'm doing this for my neighbours, for justice, our democracy, for the people who helped rebuild our houses after Katrina,"" said Taber, an immigrant justice organiser, adding that she was aware of at least 10 arrests on Wednesday by federal agents.""Immigrants are the fabric of the United States. The real criminals are in the White House."" Taber said immigrant workers and school children were staying home across the city as the immigration operation began. ""Business in New Orleans has been paralyzed,"" she said. ""People are having to choose between their jobs and their families.""New Orleans city council member Lesli Harris said the enforcement operation was causing fear and anxiety in the city, telling CNN that ""what we're learning is that they are targeting people who are here legally … who are mothers of children, high school students.”The operation in New Orleans was expected to run through the end of the year but its scope remains unclear.Last month a US official told Reuters that Gregory Bovino, a US Border Patrol official who has led Trump’s crackdown in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, had plans to head to New Orleans. Bovino on Wednesday confirmed he was in the city, writing on social media that ""we are here arresting criminals who should not be here. The state, local and federal law enforcement partners in Louisiana are excellent partners!""Last month a federal judge terminated a 2013 consent decree that had limited the ability of the New Orleans Police Department to assist federal immigration enforcement. Still, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said in late November that the city would not enforce federal immigration law. The Department of Justice labelled New Orleans a ""sanctuary city"" in a list published in August.The action in New Orleans, with a population of around 384 000, follows a Border Patrol-led operation in Charlotte, North Carolina.","Immigration officials began an operation in New Orleans on Wednesday to arrest immigrants in the US illegally, federal officials said.

Grammy-winning pop star Sabrina Carpenter on Tuesday publicly rebuked the White House after the Trump administration used her song “Juno” in a video promoting its ongoing deportation drive.The clip, posted on X through the official White House account, was part of a series highlighting nationwide ICE raids and featured the track from Carpenter’s album Short n’ Sweet without her consent.Carpenter sharply condemned the use of her music, in a post on X, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”The White House, however, pushed back.In a response to Entertainment Weekly, an official representative said, “Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter, we won't apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country.”The official also referenced the singer’s song “Manchild” from her album Man’s Best Friend, adding, “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”Carpenter joins the long list of musicians to object to the Trump administration’s use of copyrighted music in political messaging. Earlier this year, Kenny Loggins demanded the removal of his hit “Danger Zone” from an AI-generated video shared by President Trump on Truth Social depicting him as “King Trump” flying a fighter jet.“Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied… I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us,” Loggins said in a statement.In November, fellow Grammy winner Olivia Rodrigo criticised the administration after her song “All-American B***h” was used in a video promoting self-deportation. “Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” she wrote on Instagram.","Grammy-winning pop star Sabrina Carpenter publicly rebuked the White House after the administration used her song “Juno’ in a video promoting its ongoing deportation drive.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting





US President Donald Trump on Thursday said a US delegation had a “very good” meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Washington’s Ukraine peace proposal, adding that the talks gave the “impression” that Putin “would like to end the war.”The comments came a day after US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law met Putin in Moscow for five hours to review proposals outlined in four documents previously submitted to the Kremlin.""Putin had a very good meeting yesterday with Jared Kushner and with Steve Whitkoff. What comes out of that meeting, I can't tell you because it does take two to tango,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, as cited by ANI. ""He (Putin) would like to end the war, that was their impression.""However, despite the extensive five-hour discussion, the two sides only reviewed the broad outlines of the US proposals and did not reach any compromises or agree to hold a new Putin–Trump summit, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.Ushakov noted that while both delegations reviewed possible pathways to a settlement, several key disagreements remained unresolved.""We could agree on some things, and the president confirmed this to his interlocutors,"" Ushakov said. ""Other things provoked criticism, and the president also made no secret of our critical and even negative attitude toward a number of proposals. But the main thing is that a very useful discussion took place.""Ushakov stressed that the talks would remain private. “The discussion was confidential,” he said. “We agreed not to disclose the substance of the negotiations.”He said that meaningful progress has yet to be achieved, though diplomatic engagement “continues.” The Kremlin adviser added that Putin asked Witkoff to pass “a number of important political signals” directly to Trump.The 28-point US peace proposal unveiled last month drew criticism from Ukraine and several European governments, who argued it leaned too far in Moscow’s favor. US officials later said certain provisions had been revised following feedback from Kyiv and European partners.Trump has intensified his push in recent weeks, convinced that Ukraine’s battlefield setbacks and the rising costs for Moscow could move both sides toward a negotiated deal. American officials say that in working to put proposals on paper and present them to both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, more diplomacy has taken place in the past few weeks than in the previous three years, as cited by the New York Times.People familiar with the discussions say negotiations are now moving on four parallel tracks. One focuses on matters related to Ukraine’s sovereignty, including potential limits on the size of its peacetime army and the range of its missiles. The remaining tracks address territorial questions, economic cooperation, and broader European security issues.Tuesday’s meeting marked the sixth and longest session between Witkoff and Putin in Russia this year. For the first time, they were joined by Jared Kushner, who helped negotiate October’s Gaza ceasefire and was a principal architect of the Abraham Accords normalizing ties between Israel and several Arab states during Trump’s first term.",US President Donald Trump on Thursday said a US delegation had a “very good” meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

"‘President of peace’: US state department rebrands USIP after Trump, ahead of Rwanda-DRC deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/president-of-peace-us-state-department-rebrands-usip-after-trump-ahead-of-rwanda-drc-deal/articleshow/125755840.cms,"



The US state department on Wednesday announced that the building of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, DC, has been rebranded as the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.This marks the first time the institute has been rededicated under a sitting president’s name. The announcement was made through an official post on X that read: “This morning, the State Department renamed the former Institute of Peace to reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history. Welcome to the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace. The best is yet to come.”US secretary of state Marco Rubio, backing the move, wrote on X: “President Trump will be remembered by history as the President of Peace. It's time our State Department display that.”The decision comes ahead of Thursday’s expected signing of a US-brokered peace agreement between the presidents of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to be hosted at the newly labelled building.The renamed sign was also installed outside the institute on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly defended the decision, saying, “Now, the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace, which is both beautifully and aptly named after a president who ended eight wars in less than a year, will stand as a powerful reminder of what strong leadership can accomplish for global stability. Congratulations, world!”The claim that Trump ended “eight wars” this year remains widely disputed, with several conflicts - including the Israel-Hamas war - still unresolved.The development has revived scrutiny of the administration’s earlier attempt to take control of USIP. The Trump administration had removed the institute’s board and staff and installed its own leadership before a federal judge ruled the move unlawful, calling it a “gross usurpation of power.”The institute, funded by the US Congress and designed to function independently of the executive branch, has been operating in a limited capacity since the ruling. It did not respond to requests for comment on the renaming.The peace agreement expected to be signed this week follows months of escalating violence in eastern Congo, where the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group seized major cities earlier this year, raising fears of a wider regional conflict. A US-brokered deal was reached in June and is now set for formalisation as the administration turns the spotlight on what it describes as President Trump’s expanding diplomatic legacy.","The building in Washington, DC, has been rebranded as the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed his attacks on Somali-American community and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, repeating a series of claims while speaking to reporters at the White House. His remarks came after he was asked about Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey saying he was proud the city hosts the largest Somali community in the United States.Responding sharply, Trump said, “Well then he is a fool. I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian community, look at their nation… people just walking around killing each other.” He went on to allege, “These Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country...”Targeting Representative Ilhan Omar, Trump repeated long-running accusations surrounding her personal life, saying, “They have a representative, Ilhan Omar, who they say married her brother. It's a fraud. She tries to deny it now but can’t really deny it, cuz yeah just happened.” He added that she “shouldn't be allowed to be the congresswomen” and should be “thrown hell out of our country.”Trump also blamed the community for what he described as deterioration in Minnesota, saying, “These people have destroyed Minnesota.”He also took aim at the Minnesota governor, “you have a incompetent governor, a crooked governor…he should be ashamed - a beautiful land and a beautiful state is a hell hole right now.Trump further went on to say the only thing Omar and the community does is complain about everything. “These people all they do is complain, complain, complain, You have her she’s always - constitution provides me - go back to your own country and figure out your constitution. All she does is complain about this country and without this country she would be in a very good shape and probably wouldn't be alive,” he said.Linking the arrival of Somali refugees to the Obama administration, Trump said, “What they have done to Minnesota has a lot to do with the governor and a lot to do with Barack Obama because that’s when these people started coming to our country.”His latest remarks come a day after Trump during his cabinet meeting targeted the sommunity by caling Somalis ""garbage'.Responding to the President, congresswomen Omar posted on X, ""His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs,"" while reacting to a video where Trump was talking about her.She also responded to Trump's repeated claims of marrying her brother saying she didn't and went on to question if the President is pedophile.""I didn’t but is your President a pedophile?""","US President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on Somali-American community and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, repeating a series of claims while speaking to reporters at the White House.

'No problem': Trump backs release of alleged drug boat strike footage; repeats warning of land strikes in Venezuela,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-problem-trump-backs-release-of-alleged-drug-boat-strike-footage-repeats-warning-of-land-strikes-in-venezuela/articleshow/125755685.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would support the release of any footage of the multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat from September 2, while backing the “decision to knock out the boats. ”The Trump administration and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth in particular have been under scrutiny in recent days after The Washington Post reported that the US military carried out a subsequent strike on a boat in the Caribbean despite there apparently being survivors. CBS News has not independently confirmed the existence of survivors, but the White House has confirmed the boat was struck more than once on September 2.“I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’ll certainly release, no problem,” the president said of any strike footage.A reporter asked the president in the Oval Office if Hegseth, Adm. Frank Bradley or others should be punished if survivors were indeed clinging to the boat. The administration has suggested that Bradley, the commander of the operation, gave the order for the second strike and was within his rights to do so.The president responded, “I think you’re going to find that this is war,” saying drugs smuggled into the United States have killed millions.“I think you’re going to find that there’s a very receptive ear to doing exactly what they’re doing, taking out those boats,” Trump added.When pressed again on whether he supported a decision to kill survivors, the president said, “No, I support the decision to knock out the boats.”On Sunday, the president told reporters on Air Force One that he “wouldn’t have wanted” a second strike on the boat. Since then, the administration has defended Hegseth and his leadership.The president on Wednesday also repeated an earlier threat that land strikes in Venezuela could begin soon as tensions with President Nicolás Maduro run high. “Very soon, we’re going to start doing it on land, too,” he said. “You know, the land is much easier … And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we’re going to start that very soon, too. ”Trump has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration’s sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is “totally prepared” to carry out land strikes. If the president orders strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration’s anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.The boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn’t provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the US is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.","The president said he would support the release of any footage of the multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat from September 2.

Caribbean strike controversy



Rooted in US campaign against Houthis



The Atlantic





US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is back in the political hot seat as the Pentagon’s watchdog alleged he put American personnel and missions at risk by using the Signal messaging app to share sensitive details about a strike targeting Yemen’s Houthi militants.Trump administration officials used the encrypted app Signal to coordinate sensitive military strikes against Yemen’s Houthi militants in March — and the group chat accidentally included a journalist. Then–national security adviser Mike Waltz set up the chat with several of Trump’s top Cabinet officials but mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.And later, The Atlantic published additional text messages from the Signal group chat, underscoring a massive breach in operational security as specific sensitive information about the Houthi attack was shared in the chat before it was carried out.Sources familiar with the classified report — now parked with the Senate Armed Services Committee — say Hegseth blasted out minute-by-minute updates such as “1215 ET: F-18s LAUNCH” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target” in a Signal chat.The inspector general’s probe — launched in April at lawmakers’ request — examined whether Hegseth sidestepped secure communications and ignored records rules. A redacted public version is expected Thursday, as bipartisan critics argue Hegseth’s real-time “declassification by group chat” put troops at risk, AP news agency reported.Hegseth told the group “We are currently clean on OPSEC” after strikes, celebrating the collapse of a building housing a top Houthi missile commander. But the IG faulted him for using a personal device in violation of policy, noting that even if he had authority to declassify, details remained sensitive while pilots were en route. Critics, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, said those launch-time sequences were “inherently classified” and could have gotten aviators killed if intercepted. Waltz later admitted the accidental add and even sought help from Elon Musk for digital forensics.According to the one of the sources said Hegseth technically has the authority to declassify information, and the review didn’t conclude that he mishandled classified material. But it did find that he violated Pentagon policy by conducting official business from a personal device and recommended better training for Defense Department officials.Hegseth refused an in-person interview with the inspector general, instead submitting a written statement, the person said. He argued that he was allowed to declassify information and only shared details he believed would not jeopardize operations.The early conclusions intensify pressure on the former Fox News host, as lawmakers had already demanded an independent investigation into his use of the commercial app. Members of Congress are also probing a separate report that a follow-up strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean in September killed survivors after Hegseth allegedly ordered forces to “kill everybody.”Hegseth defended that strike as part of the “fog of war,” saying he did not see any survivors but also “didn’t stick around,” and that the admiral in charge “made the right call” in ordering the second attack. He denied any wrongdoing related to the Signal chats, insisting the material was unclassified.“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. “This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”President Donald Trump “stands by” Hegseth, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, noting the review confirmed that “no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.”Houthi rebels began firing missiles and drones at commercial and naval ships in late 2023, saying the attacks were aimed at ending Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. Those assaults sharply reduced traffic through the Red Sea, which normally handles about $1 trillion in yearly trade.The US-led response in 2024 became the most sustained naval fight since World War II.A ceasefire in Israel and Gaza began in January but fell apart in March. The US then launched a broad assault on Houthi targets, which ended weeks later after Trump said the group agreed to stop targeting ships. Another Gaza ceasefire took effect in October.After it became public that Hegseth’s Signal chat included’s editor, the magazine published the entire thread in March. The messages showed Hegseth laying out strike windows, target locations, timing elements, and which aircraft and weapons would be used.

"Enough: Turning Point USA stops Candace Owens' slander, invites her to livestream; 'Charlie saw her as a friend'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/enough-turning-point-usa-stops-candace-owens-slander-invites-her-to-livestream-charlie-saw-her-as-a-friend/articleshow/125752762.cms,"



Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA finally broke the silence about Candace Owens' flood of allegations against organization members over Kirk's assassination. For the past two months, right-wing podcaster Candace had moved from one conspiracy theory to another, pinning the blame on Kirk's assassination on the organization members. In a message Wednesday, Turning Point USA said they are inviting Candace for a livestream where the organization would debunk all her false claims. Kirk's organization said they maintained their silence because Candace calls herself a friend of Charlie Kirk but now they won't remain silent anymore, as that's not what Charlie would have done.Candace suggested that Kirk's assassination was an 'inside job' and that Charlie Kirk's Utah Valley University event, where he was killed, seemed unusual. Candace suggested that there was an intentional delay in providing Kirk with first aid. Candace also suggested that many people in Turning Point USA knew they Charlie would be murdered.Candace said Charlie Kirk was 'betrayed' by everyone, alleging financial irregularities in Turning Point USA and also suggested Israeli, French roles in the murder.All that Candace claimed are lies and innuendoes thrown with zero regard to the facts, Turning Point USA said, adding that they could not grieve properly after Charlie's heinous murder as they were being harassed, triggered by Candace's allegations.""For a long time, our approach was to say nothing. We did that for several reasons. First, we thought her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. Second, Charlie followed a rule of thumb to not feed the troll and instead focus on the mission. Lastly, we did not respond as Charlie always viewed Candace as a friend and we were holding our hope that she would return that friendship,"" Turning Point USA's Blake Neff said.The organization said they would hold a livestream in Phoenix where Candace would be invited if she is free and Turning Point USA will put forth its facts against Candace's lies. The organization said as their silence had nothing to do with complacency, they are not breaking their silence because of any obligation to Candace, but only because of Charlie as Charlie was not a coward and he would not have allowed such slander.","Right-wing podcaster Candace had moved from one conspiracy theory to another, pinning the blame on Kirk's assassination on the organization members.

Explained: What Tennessee’s election reveals about 2026 battlefield for Democrats and Republicans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-what-tennessees-election-reveals-about-2026-battlefield-for-democrats-and-republicans/articleshow/125751079.cms,"Trump On Edge As Brutal Tennessee Race Threatens Deep-Red District To Flip Blue | Watch





A surprisingly competitive special election in deep-red Tennessee revealed one of the most important early signals about the 2026 midterms: both parties believe affordability will decide the political battlefield, and Democrats are beginning to claw back voters they lost last year.Republican Matt Van Epps won the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, defeating Democratic state lawmaker Aftyn Behn by nine points. On paper, the race should not have been close. US President Donald Trump carried the district with about 60 percent of the vote in 2024, and former Representative Mark Green won it by similar margins before resigning in July.Yet millions of dollars in late spending and a clear double-digit swing towards the Democrats transformed what should have been a routine Republican hold into a nationally watched contest. Democratic gains in urban and suburban pockets of Nashville were similar to the party’s overperformances in dozens of special elections this year.Van Epps celebrated the result as a win powered by the MAGA chief’s continued influence. “Running from Trump is how you lose. Running with Trump is how you win,” he said, thanking the president for “unwavering support” and promising to be “all-in with him” in Congress, according to NPR.Trump said the same in a Truth Social message, telling GOP supporters it was “another great night for the Republican Party.”Both parties focussed on ads centred heavily on cost-of-living issues. Van Epps promised to lower prices, expand jobs and cut health-care costs. Behn vowed to “shake up Washington” by making health care affordable and easing the burden on workers and small businesses. Even so, Trump dismissed affordability altogether during a tele-rally, claiming Democrats used the topic as “a con job.”Republicans will now hold a 220-213 House majority until Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene resigns in early January.","Republican Matt Van Epps won the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, defeating Democratic state lawmaker Aftyn Behn by nine points.
