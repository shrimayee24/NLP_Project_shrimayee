Hindus take to Bangladesh streets to stop attacks and demand justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindus-take-to-bangladesh-streets-to-stop-attacks-and-demand-justice/articleshow/113335635.cms,"DHAKA: Thousands of Hindus took to the streets Friday in Dhaka and Bangladesh commercial capital Chattogram to demand effective measures to stop attacks on them since former PM Sheikh Hasina 's ouster on Aug 5. Braving rain, the demonstrators carried placards with eight-point demands, including punishment to the attackers through a fast-track tribunal. The protests came two days after chief adviser Muhammad Yunus told the nation in a televised speech that no one should do anything to hurt religious harmony .In Chattogram, Hindus demanded a separate ministry to deal with minority affairs, reserved seats for minorities, and asked the coordinators of the students' protests to sit with them, giving them 15 days to act. The protests had culminated in the Hasina-led govt's fall and her flight to India.The Hindu demonstrators said they would not return to their homes until their demands were met, including compensation and rehabilitation of those affected. Referring to targeted killings, looting and destruction of their properties, they also demanded a separate minority protection act. They asserted they were not acting as anyone's ""agent"", a label they alleged was often foisted on minorities whenever they spoke up for their rights.In Chattogram, protesters, including women, gathered in Jamal Khan area and demonstrated from 3pm. Describing themselves as ""Bangali (Bangladesh natives)"", they declared they will not leave this land.Some demonstrators expressed displeasure over the media role as their voices are not heard via mainstream media outlets. One of them urged the authorities to take note reports of daily Prothom Alo about the attacks on minorities.In Dhaka, protesters besieged the landmark Shahbag intersection with similar demands around 4.30pm, halting traffic. Watched by security forces, the programme was held under the banner of Sanatani Odhikar Andolan, which consists of many Hindu organisations.Meanwhile, Paris-based human rights organisation Justice Makers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the recent wave of attacks targeting against minorities. The destruction of homes, businesses and places of worship represents a grave violation of human rights, the organisation said on Friday.","Thousands of Hindus took to the streets Friday in Dhaka and Chattogram to demand effective measures to stop attacks on them.

He was also told about the chemicals, also known as truth serum , like sodium pentothal, scopolamine and sodium amytal which are used in the test.Since CBI found inconsistencies in his statements, it decided to ask for narco-analysis, as it makes a person enter the hypnotic stage and become less inhibited. In this stage, the person is more likely to divulge information, which would usually not be revealed in conscious state.After Roy came out of the magistrate's chamber, the judge emerged with a sealed envelope and opened it in front of the lawyers inside the courtroom. Roy's lawyer Kabita Sarkar argued that despite claims that narco-analysis does not have any life risk, it cannot be trusted completely. ""Chances of going back to normal life are slim after the test is done,"" she said.The magistrate, while declaring that Roy has declined to give his consent, said, ""This is unconstitutional and the privacy of the accused would be breached.""","CBI's plea to conduct a narco-analysis on Sanjay Roy rejected by additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) court.

Four arrested for Greater Kailash I businessman killing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/four-arrested-for-greater-kailash-i-businessman-killing/articleshow/113335612.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shooters from Uttar Pradesh's Azamgarh and the Trans-Yamuna region allegedly bumped off Dubai-based entrepreneur Nadir Shah in south Delhi's Greater Kailash I on Thursday night, a probe has revealed. Delhi Police 's Special Cell has managed to detain around seven suspects - four of whom have been placed under arrest - for the brazen killing that TOI reported on Friday.Two of the main shooters, captured on CCTV, have been identified as Madhur and Raju but are on the run.As of now, gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi , Rohit Godara and Hashim Baba are being considered the masterminds of the shootout. While several motives are being floated, investigators believe it was a 'symbolic killing' aimed at sending a strong signal to big businessmen in both Dubai and India.There were several reasons why Shah was a target. He was a friend of south Delhi gangster Rohit Chaudhary and another entity codenamed K. ""This irked Bishnoi, who was apparently informed that Shah had a multi-crore rupee transaction with K,"" said a source. ""The Bishnoi group was also being tipped on how Shah used his contacts to target Baba's men. So, they decided to send a message.""A land shark, codenamed AJ, from south Delhi but now settled in Dubai and another criminal from northeast Delhi named Sabir are also under the scanner for involvement in the conspiracy.The Azamgarh module - comprising Akash, Prince and Vishal - arrived in the city on Thursday and stayed in Jamia Nagar. Baba's men allegedly provided them logistical support and weapons. Some other men like Naveen from Sonipat also joined them. They reached the gym in GKI in an autorickshaw and a two-wheeler. They zeroed in on the target who was standing outside the gym, and Madhur pulled the trigger around 10.45pm, said a police officer. The assailants fired 15 rounds, nine of which hit Shah. They then fled, some going to Seelampur and the others elsewhere. Akash, Prince, Vishal and Naveen were arrested with a copy of a US-made Ruger pistol and dozens of bullets early on Friday.Around midnight, a Facebook account in the name of Rohit Godara claimed responsibility for the murder. ""Our brother Samir Baba, lodged in Tihar Jail, had sent a message that Nadir was creating obstacles in our business and was friends with our enemies, so we got him killed. Whoever helps our enemies will meet the same fate,"" the post from a day-old account stated. Godara is the man Friday of Bishnoi and Goldy Brar and has been behind many killings across the country, including that of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Gogamedi. The post is cryptic, an investigator said, because it doesn't mention Bishnoi, which is usually the case after such killings but mentions instead the names of associates like Gogi Maan and Kala Rana. Godara likely funded the shooters, the cops say.Sources said that the killing has a strong connection with the Trans-Yamuna region and the Baba, the area's most dreaded gangster, has emerged as a key character in the plot. His rivalry with incarcerated south Delhi gangster Rohit Chaudhary is being probed. ""Baba was irked as Shah and Chaudhary were not letting his men operate in south Delhi areas like Aya Nagar, etc., using their contacts. Nadir was also an informer for some cops and used the connection to tip off police about the Baba gang's activities,"" said a source. Samir, mentioned in the Facebook post, is also a gangster who operates in northeast Delhi on Baba's instructions but is currently in jail after the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital shooting in July.Baba's alliance with Bishnoi has been in police knowledge for over three years. ""Bishnoi had initially tasked Baba to assassinate Siddhu Moose Wala. Baba's aide, Shahrukh, had conducted a reconnaissance of the slain singer's movements. Shahrukh even reached Mansa in Punjab with weapons, but was unable to carry out the killing,"" informed a source. Baba, who is in Mandoli jail and faces charges under MCOCA, has over two dozen cases registered against him, including for murder, extortion, attempted murder and violation of the Arms Act.","Gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi, Rohit Godara and Hashim Baba are being considered the masterminds of the shootout.

Who was Kristina Joksimovic

?

Kristina Joksimovic , a 38-year-old former Miss Switzerland finalist , was tragically murdered by her husband in February in Binningen , near Basel , Switzerland. The brutal details of her death were revealed in a court ruling that rejected her husband’s appeal for release, after he confessed to the killing.Joksimovic, who had earned the title of Miss Northwest Switzerland and was a finalist for Miss Switzerland in 2007, was found dead and dismembered on February 13.Her 41-year-old husband, identified in local media only as ""Thomas,"" was arrested shortly after.According to reports, Joksimovic was brutally strangled, dismembered, and her remains shockingly ""pureed"" by her husband in a crime that has horrified Switzerland. The 38-year-old’s mutilated body was discovered in February in their home in Binningen, near Basel, and gruesome new details have come to light following a recent court ruling.Thomas initially claimed he found her dead and dismembered her body in a panic, but later admitted to killing her in March, citing self-defense after alleging she had attacked him with a knife. However, medical experts found no evidence of this, and her cause of death was determined to be strangulation.His plea was denied by Switzerland’s federal court on Wednesday. The court disclosed shocking elements of the ongoing investigation, which has revealed ""concrete indications of a mental illness."" Thomas claimed he killed Joksimovic in self-defense, alleging she had previously attacked him with a knife, but the evidence told a different, horrifying story.On the night of February 13, Joksimovic’s body was found strangled. According to the autopsy report, her remains were dismembered using a jigsaw, a knife, and garden shears.The horror escalated when investigators discovered that some of her body parts were then chopped up with a hand blender, ""pureed,"" and dissolved in a chemical solution.Despite his self-defense claim, experts found no signs of any such struggle.Instead, prosecutors pointed to the chilling nature of the crime. Thomas had shown ""a high level of criminal energy, lack of empathy, and cold-bloodedness"" in both the killing and the subsequent attempt to cover up his actions. He initially told authorities he had panicked after finding her dead, dismembering her in a frenzy.This wasn’t the first time Thomas had been violent. Prosecutors revealed that he had choked his wife before. In fact, a former partner of his alleged that he had once grabbed Joksimovic by the neck and slammed her head into a wall, suggesting a history of abuse that had gone unchecked.Joksimovic, who was crowned Miss Northwest Switzerland and reached the finals for Miss Switzerland in 2007, was much more than a beauty queen. She had later pursued a career as a catwalk coach , mentoring models, including Dominique Rinderknecht, who represented Switzerland in the Miss Universe pageant in 2013.Her friends and the modeling community have been left in shock. Former Miss Switzerland Christa Rigozzi expressed her disbelief after the details of the murder were revealed. “It’s terrible. I’m really shocked,” Rigozzi told Swiss media outlet 20 Minuten. “I’m thinking of her two daughters. She was such a beautiful and kind-hearted woman.”The family, on the surface, appeared to lead a perfect life.Thomas was a successful entrepreneur, and their social media painted a picture of domestic bliss. Just weeks before the murder, the couple had posted photos from a romantic getaway at Lake Lucerne. But behind the facade was a history of violence and darkness that ultimately led to this horrifying tragedy.The brutal murder has left the couple’s two daughters without their mother, and the shocking nature of the crime has sent ripples through Switzerland.","Kristina Joksimovic, 38, was found strangled and dismembered in February.

After Simpsons memes, netizens are now responding with a new song that gives a melody to the Republican candidate's speech.Trump said: “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs.The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating – they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” His statement was later debunked by ABC moderator David Muir.Trump was referring to a racist rumor spread by his running mate JD Vance that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been abducting pets and eating them, “causing chaos” in the town. The Springfield Police Division stated that it was aware of the “rumors” but had no information to support them, according to the Independent.His false claim has turned into a meme fest, and TikTok creators have transformed it into a new dance craze .According to DailyMail.com, at least a dozen users have turned the song—created by a liberal account called ' Casa Di Music ,' which has over half a million followers—into the latest trend.On X, one user shared the video with the caption, ""Somebody already made it into the song 'Eat the Cat.'""Another user wrote, ""Trump breaks the internet with viral 'They’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats' remix trend taking over TikTok.""A user also shared the video on X with her reaction, saying that TikTokers are trolling Donald Trump for saying migrants are eating cats. ""New lesbian anthem just dropped had me rolling. Although we all know MAGA is sorely lacking in the cat-eating department if you catch my drift,"" she added.Since Trump mentioned Springfield, jokes about The Simpsons' fictional hometown have surged online, particularly focusing on the family's dog, Santa's Little Helper.“IN SPRINGFIELD THEY’RE EATING THE DOGS,” wrote one person on X, accompanied by a picture of the cartoon dog.Another netizen remarked, ""Santa's Little Helper isn't Homer's lunch #PresidentialDebate.""Springfield has been a focal point in the debate over immigration ever since thousands of Haitian migrants arrived in the city in 2020 to fill job vacancies.Willing to take on blue-collar jobs that locals were unenthusiastic about, the Haitians, who were already in the country legally, moved to the town.Within a few years, 20,000 immigrants arrived, swelling Springfield's population, which was only 58,000 in 2020.","Trump said that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been abducting pets and eating them, “causing chaos” in the town.

""They also should take care of themselves and their families.""The surge in violence had been expected after Joaquin Guzman Lopez, a son of former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman, landed near El Paso, Texas on July 25 in a small plane with Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada.Zambada was the cartel's elder figure and reclusive leader. After his arrest, he said in a letter circulated by his lawyer that he had been abducted by the younger Guzman and taken to the US against his will.Now there appears to be a struggle for power between the remaining sons of El Chapo, known locally as ""the Chapitos,"" and those loyal to Zambada.As of Thursday, state authorities had reported at least 12 dead, 11 people with gunshot wounds, 20 reports of missing people and 31 cases of car robberies. The actual number of fatalities may be higher since the cartels often pick up their own dead.Streets in Culiacan appeared empty as schools and businesses remained closed Friday and festivities around Mexican Independence on Sept. 15-16 were officially canceled by the local government.","Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador asks warring factions of the Sinaloa cartel to act ""responsibly"" ""The president of Mexico is always listened to.""""Even by criminals?"" pressed the journalist.

How quick action by Alaska Airlines pilot prevented near-collision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/quick-action-by-alaska-airlines-pilot-prevents-near-collision-with-southwest/articleshow/113306902.cms,"Alaska Airlines plane aborts takeoff to avoid potential collision

An Alaska Airlines jet on Thursday was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.Alaska Airlines confirmed that their pilots spotted ""a potential traffic conflict on the runway"" and applied the brakes immediately to prevent the situation from getting worse. No injuries were reported, but the extreme heat from the sudden stop caused the tires on the Boeing 737 Max , scheduled to depart for Seattle, to go flat.The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) is investigating the incident at the Nashville International Airport which occurred at around 9.15 am (ET), according to Chair Jennifer Homendy. ""We are clearly very concerned about this (incident) and others we are investigating,"" Homendy told reporters.The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) is also looking into the incident, which involved Southwest Airlines Flight 2029, a Boeing 737-700 , that had been cleared to cross the end of the same runway as an Alaska Airlines plane, as reported by AP.The Alaska Airlines flight was carrying 176 passengers and six crew members. The airline arranged for another plane to transport the passengers to Seattle by Thursday night while inspecting the affected aircraft. Alaska Airlines expressed gratitude for the pilots' quick response, saying, ""We’re grateful for the expertise of our pilots who immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating.""According to tracking website Flightradar24, the Alaska plane was traveling at a speed of 104 knots (120 mph, 193 km per hour) on the runway before slowing down.Southwest stated that they are in contact with the NTSB and FAA and will cooperate with the investigation. Alaska Airlines reported that maintenance technicians in Nashville are currently inspecting the aircraft involved in the incident.There have been several close calls, or ""runway incursions,"" in recent years, raising concerns about the safety of US air travel. NTSB chair Homendy had mentioned last November that while these incidents are ""incredibly rare"" compared to the number of flights, they indicate the aviation system is under stress.Recent incidents include a close call in Austin, Texas, where a FedEx jet flew over a Southwest jet taking off in foggy conditions, and a collision between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway in Atlanta. No injuries were reported in these incidents.Alaska Airlines also made headlines in January when one of the door panels blew out on a plane flying from Portland and bound for Ontario. The plane's pilot first Officer Emily Wiprud on Thursday recalled her experience of operating the flight. Her initial indication of the unfolding crisis was a deafening blast that reverberated in her ears, accompanied by a sudden rush of air. The severity of the situation was immediately apparent to her, although the presence of a breach in the aircraft's fuselage remained unknown until the plane touched down.""I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,"" Wiprud said. ""I knew something was catastrophically wrong."" Further complicating matters, her headset, along with the phones of two passengers and various airplane parts, had been forcibly ejected from the aircraft during the incident.","An Alaska Airlines jet was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff on the runway in Nashville to prevent a potential collision with a Southwest Airlines plane.

'Will be fighting directly with Russia if ...': Putin's stark warning to West,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/will-be-fighting-directly-with-russia-if-putins-stark-warning-to-west-ukraine-missile/articleshow/113307558.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday warned that if Ukrainian armed forces were permitted to attack Russian territory using Western-made long-range missiles , it would mean the West's direct involvement in the conflict, altering its nature and scope.For months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Kyiv's allies to allow Ukraine to use Western missiles, such as US ATACMS and British Storm Shadows, to strike deep into Russian territory, aiming to restrict Moscow's ability to launch attacks.In his most assertive remarks on the issue to date, Putin said that such a decision would inevitably draw the countries supplying long-range missiles to Kyiv into the war. He explained that Nato military personnel would need to provide satellite targeting data and program the missiles' flight paths, as Kyiv lacks the necessary capabilities.""So this is not a question of allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not. It is a question of deciding whether or not Nato countries are directly involved in a military conflict,"" Putin told Russian state TV.Putin added, ""If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing less than the direct involvement of Nato countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine. This will be their direct participation, and this, of course, will significantly change the very essence, the very nature of the conflict.""Putin said that Russia would be forced to make ""appropriate decisions"" based on the new threats, without specifying what those measures could entail. In the past, he has mentioned the possibility of arming the West's enemies with Russian weapons to strike Western targets abroad and, in June, discussed deploying conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies.Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 with tens of thousands of troops, triggering the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the peak of the Cold War.Putin portrays the conflict as part of an existential battle with a declining West, which he believes humiliated Russia after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine. The West and Ukraine, on the other hand, describe the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and have pledged to defeat Russia on the battlefield. Currently, Russia controls over 18% of Ukrainian territory.","Vladimir Putin: If Ukraine allowed to use Western-made missiles, it would mean the West's direct involvement in the conflict.

Throughout history, the map of the world has been in constant flux, with numerous countries vanishing or transforming into new entities.

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?” her team asked in a pointed post-debate statement.Trump, meanwhile, has wavered on whether he’s game for another debate, calling the push for a second round a sign of desperation from the Harris camp. However, he’s left the door open depending on the host network.As the dust settles, the next major clash will be between the vice presidential nominees—Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—who are scheduled to debate on October 1, setting the stage for yet another high-stakes political face-off.","A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump.

UK court finds Pakistani guilty of killing Tamil restaurant manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-finds-pakistani-guilty-of-killing-tamil-restaurant-manager/articleshow/113302859.cms,"LONDON: A Pakistan-born man, Shazeb Khalid , has been found guilty of murdering Vignesh Pattabiraman , a 36-year-old Tamil who worked as a restaurant manager in Reading, UK on Valentines Day this year.The jury at Reading crown court on Wednesday found Khalid, 25, guilty of the murder of Pattabiraman by deliberately running his car into him for a ‘contract fee’ of £2,000.Pattabiraman died at Royal Berkshire Hospital early on February 15. A postmortem examination found he died of head injury.Pattabiraman, who hailed from IOB Colony near Marudamalai in Coimbatore, moved to the UK with his wife, Ramya, in December 2022. After quitting his job at south Indian restaurant Vel, he was due to start a job at Hyatt Regency London – The Churchill two days later, but was mown down by a stolen red Range Rover.The crown case was that Vel restaurant 's operation manager Mohammed Sadiq Ishmail , an Indian national, had asked Soiheem Hussain, his friend, to find someone to threaten Pattabiraman, who he believed was snitching on the restaurant for employing illegal staff.

Houston shocker: Cats cut in half found in East End amid speculative pet-eating theories in Ohio,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/houston-shocker-cats-cut-in-half-found-in-east-end-amid-speculative-pet-eating-theories-in-ohio/articleshow/113337923.cms,"Bodies cut in half, paws missing, missing limbs

Community reactions and investigation

Over 50 animals found dead in San Leon

Trump vows ""large deportations""

Amid unfounded conspiracy theories alleging that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are involved in eating pet cats , Houston is grappling with a chilling case of animal cruelty after multiple severed cat bodies were discovered in the city's East End over the past two weeks.The first report emerged on August 26th, with subsequent findings on Sunday and Wednesday.The remains of the cats were disturbingly displayed in public areas, cut in half with missing limbs and paws, their internal organs left intact and no blood surrounding the bodies, as reported by Click2Houston.Witness Jackson Hime provided a harrowing account of the discoveries. “My mom was out walking her dog, and she passed by, saw that black cat was severed in half,” Hime said as quoted by Click2Houston. “It doesn’t look natural to me.”Hime’s unsettling observation was corroborated by others who found the mutilated animals. “It’s disgusting. It’s frightening,” Hime continued. “For this to happen three times in two weeks when we haven’t seen anything like this in 30 years, I find it hard to believe that that’s just a random animal attack.”The Houston Police Department's Animal Cruelty Unit has reportedly launched an investigation into these macabre incidents. Detectives are treating the cases with heightened urgency, given the brutal nature of the mutilations and the apparent pattern of the incidents.The discovery of the severed cat bodies has sparked fear and outrage among Houston residents. Reports indicate that the mutilated remains were deliberately left in areas frequented by the public, intensifying the sense of horror within the community.The cases have also drawn attention from animal rights advocates and local organizations, who are rallying for increased vigilance and preventive measures.“There’s a sense of dread and disbelief in the community,” said local resident Grizzy Castillo. “Finding severed and dismembered cats, especially with such precision and care to leave them exposed, is both disturbing and unprecedented in this area.”The investigation is ongoing, with animal cruelty detectives working to determine if the incidents are connected or if they point to a broader issue of animal abuse in the region. Authorities are also considering whether these acts might be part of a larger pattern of cruelty or if they reflect an isolated individual’s behavior.The discovery in Houston comes in the wake of another grim finding in San Leon, Texas, where about 50 dead animals, including cats, horses, cows, a raccoon, and dogs, were found on a property, reported Fox26. The investigation was triggered by the search for a missing cat, Cheesecake, which led to the shocking revelation of widespread animal cruelty.“This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Kaylee Humburger, whose cat led to the grim finding, was distraught over the condition of the property. Grizzy Castillo, founder of Grizzy Hood News, described the scene as a “holocaust for cats,” recounting stepping over dead carcasses and empty food cans. “We stepped on dead carcass after dead carcass, and kennel after kennel, with dead carcasses with empty cans of food,” Castillo reported.The property owner, who had been running a trap-and-release (TNR) program with local shelters, is now facing criminal charges. Investigations revealed the owner had a history of animal-related offenses. Neighbors had previously alerted officials about the dire conditions, but the full extent of the cruelty was only recently uncovered.Amid these local tragedies, former President Donald Trump has reignited controversy with his campaign promises. On Friday, Trump vowed to initiate “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio, citing unfounded claims that Haitian migrants there are involved in eating pets. “We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,”Trump declared, emphasizing his intention to begin with Springfield and Aurora, Colorado. Despite the debunked nature of his claims, Trump’s statements have intensified the national debate on immigration and animal cruelty.","Multiple severed cat bodies were discovered in the city's East End over the past two weeks.

'We need help, not hate'

Former President Donald Trump pledged on Friday to initiate massive deportations from Springfield , Ohio , if re-elected. He claimed, without evidence, that Haitian migrants in the city were eating cats and dogs. Speaking to reporters in California, Trump said, ""We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,"" at a press conference at his golf resort near Los Angeles targeting what he described as ""barbaric criminals"" causing harm in US communities.The majority of the 15,000 Haitians in Springfield are there legally. Trump's longstanding pledge to conduct mass deportations usually refers to those in the country illegally.Trump did not repeat the assertion he made during Tuesday's presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that immigrants were eating dogs and cats, remarks that have been widely mocked.Trump has cited the tensions in Springfield as another example of the need for hardline immigration polices. The influx of Haitians has boosted the economy but also has strained social services.During a recent debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump repeated the false allegation that migrants in Springfield were consuming household pets. ""They're eating the dogs — the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" he claimed, despite moderator David Muir pointing out that the city manager had refuted the claim. Trump insisted, ""I’ve seen people saying it on television.""Following the debate, Trump shared AI-generated social media posts showing pets supporting his candidacy.Springfield, a city of 58,000, has seen a significant rise in its Haitian migrant population in recent years, largely due to legal immigration programs. The influx has helped the city meet rising labor demand after decades of industrial decline, reported CBS. Most of these migrants are in the US legally through Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and humanitarian parole programs, which allow them to live and work while their home countries experience crisis.Despite Trump's claims, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, along with Springfield’s mayor and police chief, confirmed that there have been no credible reports of migrants stealing or eating pets.While acknowledging the strain on local healthcare systems, Governor DeWine announced a $2.5 million initiative to expand primary care access in Springfield, where many Haitian migrants have limited health services. ""We will continue to do everything we can to help the community deal with this surge of migrants,"" DeWine said, criticizing the federal government's lack of a clear plan.President Joe Biden denounced Trump’s remarks during a White House event celebrating Black excellence, calling the comments harmful to the Haitian community. ""This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop,"" Biden said, referring to the inflammatory claims Trump and his allies have made about Springfield’s migrants.Despite Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, painting Springfield as a community in crisis, local leaders and experts have consistently rejected their claims, pointing to the important contributions of migrants in the region.Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield. ""We need help, not hate,"" Springfield's mayor Rob Rue told ABC News.City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of ""crimes of opportunity,"" such as property theft.","Former President Donald Trump pledged on Friday to initiate massive deportations from Springfield, Ohio.

Why Laura Loomer is on Trump's plane

Former president Donald Trump finally reacted to the ongoing Laura Loomer controversy that became the national headline after MAGA veterans distanced from the far right-wing provocateur while Laura was seen hanging out with Donald Trump. Laura called Kamala Harris 'evil bimbo' and said the White House will smell of curry if Kamala Harris wins the election. The racist slur did not get endorsement from the GOP veterans but Laura Loomer fired back and said she will not apologize for thinking that Kamala Harris is an incompetent DEI hire.She said Republicans who are apologizing to Kamala Harris for what she said are weak.Amid the controversy, a photo of Laura with Donald Trump went viral and social media users questioned the relationship between 31-year-old Laura and 78-year-old Donald Trump.Trump finally put an end to all speculations and used two words to describe Laura Loomer. Free spirit -- Donald Trump described the rabble-rouser. “Laura’s been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign. I’m not sure why you asked that question, but Laura is a supporter. I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit,” Trump said at a news conference in Southern California.“Look, I can’t tell Laura what to do. Laura’s a supporter. I have a lot of supporters.”Laura Loomer was there with Donald Trump when he attended some events to mark the 9/11 anniversary. Her proximity with Donald Trump campaign rattled old-times as they said they have been trying to keep such conspiracy theorists away from Trump. It has been speculated that Trump referred to the Haitian conspiracy theory at the debate stage because he was influenced by Laura.Donald Trump said he heard about it for the first time and he thinks Laura is just a person with strong opinions. “She’s a strong person. She’s got strong opinions, and I don’t know what she said, but that’s not up to me. She’s a supporter,” Trump said.“I do know that she may have said something based on what you’re telling me, but I don’t know what she said, but I’ll go take a look and I’ll put out a statement later on.”Donald Trump was asked why he took along Laura Loomer on his plane to the Philadelphia debate while there were some only some close advisers and family members. Trump downplayed it and said, ""A lot of people do (travel with him). It's a very big plane.""",Laura Loomer called Kamala Harris 'evil bimbo' and said the White House will smell of curry if she wins the election.

Gambian Death Squad: US trial of alleged Gambian 'death squad' member postponed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-trial-of-alleged-gambian-death-squad-member-postponed/articleshow/113332876.cms,"LOS ANGELES: The US trial on torture charges of a Gambian man who was allegedly a member of a notorious death squad known as the "" Junglers "" has been postponed at the last minute.Michael Sang Correa , 45, a former captain in the Gambian military, was scheduled to go on trial in a federal court in Denver, Colorado, on Monday.But the presiding judge granted a defense motion on Wednesday to delay the trial to allow Correa's attorneys to travel to The Gambia to collect videotaped depositions from two witnesses.A new trial date has not been set. It is not expected to be held until next year.Correa was indicted in June 2020 and faces six counts of inflicting torture and one count of conspiracy to commit torture. Each count is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.He is being tried in the United States for crimes committed in his home country under what is known as universal jurisdiction , which allows for prosecution of torture, genocide and war crimes.According to Human Rights Watch and Trial International, Correa's torture trial is just the third of its kind to be held in the United States and the first involving a non-US citizen.Correa entered the United States in 2016 to work as a bodyguard for Gambia's vice president, who was visiting the United Nations.He stayed in the country and moved to Denver at some point after Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh , who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1994 to 2017, was voted out of office.Correa was arrested by US authorities in September 2019, initially for overstaying his visa.According to the indictment, Correa joined the Junglers in 2004.The paramilitary unit operated outside the Gambian army's chain of command, taking orders directly from Jammeh, and has been accused by watchdog groups of carrying out widespread human rights violations.In 2006, the indictment says, Jammeh's government learned of a plan to overthrow him and arrested a number of suspected coup plotters.The prisoners were taken to Mile 2 Prison and the National Intelligence Agency headquarters, where Correa and others allegedly tortured them to coerce confessions.Some of the prisoners had molten plastic or acid dripped on their bodies while others were brutally beaten and subjected to electric shocks.Another member of the Junglers, Bai Lowe, was sentenced to life in prison in Germany in November after being convicted of crimes against humanity, murder and attempted murder.A Swiss court in May sentenced Gambian ex-interior minister Ousman Sonko to 20 years in prison for crimes against humanity committed under the Jammeh regime.Victims of the Junglers included an AFP correspondent, Deyda Hydara, who was gunned down in his car on the outskirts of Gambia's capital Banjul on December 16, 2004.","Michael Sang Correa, 45, a former captain in the Gambian military, was scheduled to go on trial in a federal court in Denver, Colorado, on Monday.

'Kamala Harris did this'

The rumor that Haitians immigrants have been stealing and eating cats and dogs has been traced to the source as it has been found that 35-year-old Erika Lee posted an anecdote in a local Facebook group. But she could not believe that the story would find a place in Donald Trump's debate speech. ""Honestly, it blew me away,"" Lee told NewsGuard. ""I didn't think that any of this would explode to the presidency.""Lee said she heard it from a neighbor (Kimberley Newton) who heard it from a friend who heard it from their daughter.The rumor was a cat owner found her dead pet hanging from a tree ready to be skinned, butchered and eaten at a house said to be occupied by Haitian immigrants . But both Lee and Kimberly were not sure about the authenticity of the rumor as they don't know the person who lost the cat.NewsGuard tracked the rumor originating from an alleged cat owner, then travelling to the cat owner's acquaintance, then to Kimberley and Erika and from there to Conservative influencer and then to JD Vance and Donald Trump.So when Lee told the story, it was a fourth-hand fable. On September 5, a screenshot of the post was shared on X and then it went viral. “My neighbor [Newton] informed me that her daughters friend had lost her cat,” Lee wrote in her post without mentioning Newton.“One day she came home from work, as soon as she stepped out of her car, looked towards a neighbors house, where Haitians live, & saw her cat hanging from a branch, like you’d do a deer for butchering, & they were carving it up to eat.”""I 've been told they are doing this to dogs, they have been doing it at snyder park with the ducks and geese, as I was told that last bit by Rangers & Police,"" the post said.Even after being called out for spreading this rumor, JD Vance stayed put on his position and posted Friday that Kamala Harris is responsible for whatever happened to Ohio. ""In Springfield, Ohio, there has been a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime. This is what happens when you drop 20,000 people into a small community. Kamala Harris's immigration policy aims to do this to every town in our country,"" JD posted.","The rumor was a cat owner found her dead pet hanging from a tree ready to be skinned, butchered and eaten at a house said to be occupied by Haitian immigrants.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

In some cases, their houses and families have been targeted.This is the first instance in Pakistan of uniformed personnel on a sit-in and blocking an inter-provincial highway for four consecutive days. The protesters have so far turned down requests by their bosses to hold talks and end the agitation.Officer Rashid Khan said the army should leave the district and let the police department work freely.“We promise to restore peace in the area within three months if military officers stop their interference,"" he said in Lakki Marwat.""Their game of playing good and bad Taliban is not over. We (police force) arrest militants and they (the military) call us to release them,"" another official at the sit-in told TOI.The army has a large presence in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, where it has been battling the Taliban and other outfits for nearly two decades.Police officials in Bajaur tribal district, bordering Afghanistan, have announced they wouldn't work even with anti-polio teams until the administration identified and arrested the killers of a colleague who was shot dead while escorting once such group in Bajaur this week.“There will be a complete boycott of polio duty,” a video circulating on social media showed a man standing among a group of uniformed personnel as saying. ""They (the government and security officials) will give us the killers of Luqman (the police constable killed in the latest attack while performing polio duty) first.""Pakistan has seen a rise in militant attacks in recent weeks, with many of them taking place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where groups like the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, have stepped up attacks, targeting security forces convoys and checkpoints, and carrying out targeted killings and kidnappings of security personnel and govt officials.At least 75 police personnel have been killed in ambushes and targeted killings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year, according to official data.","Hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi.

Gunmen kill a policeman guarding polio workers in northwestern Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gunmen-kill-a-policeman-guarding-polio-workers-in-northwestern-pakistan/articleshow/113301216.cms,"PESHAWAR: A pair of gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on Thursday and killed a policeman guarding a group of polio workers going door-to-door in a vaccination campaign in northwestern Pakistan , police said, the second attack on the country's anti-polio campaign in as many days.The latest attack took place in Bannu, a district in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to police officer Nasrullah Khan.The policeman who was gunned down was standing on a street corner and the attackers fled the scene, Khan said.In a similar attack Wednesday in Bajur, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a group of gunmen on motorcycles killed two people, a polio worker and a police escort.No one has so far claimed responsibility for the two attacks, which have spread fears among the polio workers. Authorities on Monday launched a new, nationwide polio vaccination campaign amid stepped-up security to protect the polio workers.On Monday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying officers assigned to protect polio workers in the district of South Waziristan, also in the same province, wounding six officers and three civilians. The militant Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for Monday's attack.Anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Since January, Pakistan has reported 17 new cases of polio, jeopardizing decades of efforts to eliminate polio in the country.The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under age 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in which the spread of polio has never been stopped.","Gunmen on a motorcycle kill a policeman guarding a group of polio workers.

You should fight his legal battle on merit,"" Bilawal said.Bilawal also recalled the ""Charter of Democracy"" agreement between the PML-N and the PPP, suggesting that certain factions consistently oppose political consensus. He claimed that efforts were made to undermine this consensus ""via Iftikhar Chaudhry (then chief justice of Pakistan).""",Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned Shehbaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) about the consequences of targeting political rivals.

Pakistani policeman kills blasphemy suspect inside police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-policeman-kills-blasphemy-suspect-inside-police-station/articleshow/113288514.cms,"A police officer in Quetta , Pakistan, shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday. Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.
