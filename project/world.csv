Duo held similar breakfast meeting



NEW DELHI: Just as the Congress government in Karnataka crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, chief minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar are making a renewed show of unity amid an escalating leadership tussle.Siddaramaiah on Tuesday visited Shivakumar's residence for breakfast 2.0, a gesture seen as an attempt to ease tensions just days after the two leaders held a similar meeting at the chief minister's home.Shivakumar on Monday extended an invitation to the CM to join him for breakfast, and posted on X saying, ""Me and the CM continue to work together as a team. I have invited the Hon'ble CM for breakfast tomorrow to discuss and strengthen our collective efforts to deliver on our promises to Karnataka.""His comments came after Siddaramaiah told reporters ""that day (Saturday) he (Shivakumar) asked me to come to his house for breakfast on Tuesday. I have not received any call till now. If invited, I will go. He may call. I think he will invite me.""The outreach is part of efforts to break the leadership deadlock between the two.Just two days earlier on Saturday, Shivakumar had visited the CM's Cauvery residence for a similar breakfast meeting, called by Siddaramaiah on the high command’s instructions to ease tensions and present a united front ahead of the Belagavi legislature session beginning December 8.At a closely watched joint press briefing, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar dismissed reports of a rift as ""manufactured confusion"" and agreed to remain united until the high command takes up the issue.Following the meet, Siddaramaiah said the talks had gone well. ""Breakfast was very good. All three of us ( CM, deputy CM and advisor) enjoyed it. We want to put an end to the confusion. Our mission is very clear — local elections are very important, and for the 2028 elections we are ensuring that Congress comes back to power. There is no difference between me and DKS, not now, not before,"" he said.""The media has created this confusion. From tomorrow, let there be no confusion."" He reiterated that both leaders would abide by the direction of the Congress high command, saying, ""What the high command says, we will listen to and abide by,"" he added. Siddaramaiah further said that the Assembly session would be conducted smoothly and that the party would ""fight BJP and JD(S) together.""Shivakumar, echoed the same stating that, ""People have shown great trust and given a massive mandate to us. It is our duty to deliver to the people of Karnataka… Both of us have full trust in our leadership. One word from the high command, if they tell me to wait, I will wait. Both of us will follow whatever the high command says.""He added, ""Whatever the CM says, I agree with him. We will not allow outsiders to interfere.""Home minister G Parameshwara who is another name in fray for the CM post in the state acknowledged the stir, saying ""all we want is a peaceful settlement.""""It's a good thing that our leaders are getting together again for breakfast. All we want is a peaceful settlement of whatever has happened over the month or so. As suggested by the high command, they are meeting for the second time. All the issues are settled. It is just reciprocal, nothing else,"" he said.""Everything is going smoothly. Different people have different aspirations. I don't think it is wrong. Naturally, they express their aspirations when the time comes,"" he added.The show of unity comes amid intense speculation over a possible leadership change when the government completed half of its term.Rumours were fueled by talk of a 2023 ""power-sharing"" understanding under which Siddaramaiah would serve 2.5 years and Shivakumar would lead the remaining tenure, a deal neither leader has openly acknowledged, and which the party has never confirmed.While Siddaramaiah maintains he will complete the full five-year term, Shivakumar's camp has pushed for the alleged rotational formula. The high command is now working to keep both leaders aligned to avoid instability in the state.","Chief minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar are making a renewed show of unity amid an escalating leadership tussle.

BSF warns of 120 terrorists on LoC launch pads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bsf-warns-of-120-terrorists-on-loc-launch-pads/articleshow/125702016.cms,"BSF IG Warns Of Looming Threat As 120 Terrorists Wait In PoK Despite Dip In Infiltration Attempts

SRINAGAR: Around “120 terrorists” positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch and the next phase of Operation Sindoor will be activated without hesitation if Pakistan attempts any “misadventure”, BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav said Monday.Yadav said during the border force’s annual briefing that Pakistan shifted several launch pads deeper inside its territory after Indian air and artillery strikes between May 7 and May 10, when Op Sindoor hit terrorist sites in retaliation for the Pahalgam massacre that killed 26 civilians on April 22.“We caused heavy damage during Op Sindoor. Some launch pads were moved from forward areas so they remain out of firing range of Indian Army and BSF,” Yadav said, adding that despite relocation, these sites remain under surveillance. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply.”During the May offensive, Yadav said BSF units and Army formations executed “heavy and accurate” fire assaults on Pakistani posts and launch pads. “Our units, including artillery regiments, inflicted huge casualties on Pakistani troops, damaged forward posts and destroyed several terrorist pads along the LoC.”Asked why the 69 pads were not struck earlier, he said terrain and distance limited firing solutions.“We had them under radar. Location and depth from the LoC matter. From some points it is difficult to target all launch pads,” he said.Yadav reported a sharp drop in infiltration attempts. Four attempts were recorded this year in the Kashmir frontier — two before and two after Op Sindoor — involving 13 infiltrators. “Eight were eliminated by the Army, five retreated,” he said. While the broader infiltration pattern remains unchanged, he acknowledged emergence of new tracks. “We receive inputs on new routes and cover them with the Army,” he said.Inside Kashmir valley, BSF has 13 companies working with the Army and police. Yadav flagged “silent recruitment” of terrorists and said the force is focusing on institutions functioning as “radicalisation centres”. Alerts are passed to agencies responsible for the hinterland, he said, adding that “complete synergy” exists among security forces.Following the Pahalgam attack, specialised BSF teams were deployed in the Gulmarg bowl to reinforce tourist security. “Our teams are operating professionally and effectively,” Yadav said.Despite harsh terrain, snowbound stretches, threats of sneaky strikes by Pakistani Border Action Team (BAT), sniping, ceasefire violations and fidayeen strikes, BSF personnel continue LoC duties with “full zeal and devotion”, he said.","Around “120 terrorists’ positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply,” says BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125702047,imgsize-1169991,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

SRINAGAR: CBI announced on Monday the arrest of a suspect wanted for 35 years for his alleged role in the 1989 abduction of former home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's daughter Dr Rubaiya Sayeed by the banned JKLF, whose jailed chief Yasin Malik is standing trial in the case.The central agency, which took over the case in 1990, identified the arrested man as ""absconder"" Shafat Ahmed Shangloo. He had a Rs 10 lakh bounty on his head.""Shangloo conspired with Yasin Malik and others in committing the crime. He will be produced in the TADA court, Jammu, at the stipulated time per law,"" CBI said.Rubaiya, who was 23 at the time, identified Yasin as one of her captors during a court hearing on July 15, 2022. Another witness backed her testimony in Feb 2023 when Yasin appeared at that hearing through video-conferencing from Tihar Jail, where he is serving a life sentence in a terror funding case.Rubaiya, the third of Mufti Sayeed's daughters and sister of PDP president and ex-J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti, was a medical intern when JKLF terrorists abducted her on Dec 8, 1989, from near her home in J&K's Nowgam. She was returning by bus from Lal Ded Memorial Hospital.The terrorists demanded the release of five of their jailed associates in return for Rubaiya's release. After six days of negotiations, Union govt freed the terrorists despite then J&K CM Farooq Abdullah being opposed to it. Rubaiya, who now lives in Tamil Nadu, was freed hours later.Mufti Sayeed, India's first Muslim home minister, was part the VP Singh-led Janata Dal govt.""Even if they had taken my daughter hostage, I would not have released a single terrorist,"" Farooq publicly said in 2015.On Sept 19 this year, Mehbooba wrote to home minister Amit Shah, urging him to view separatist Yasin's case through a humanitarian lens. She said his decision to ""renounce violence and embrace political engagement and non-violent dissent"" required courage that should not be overlooked.""I write to you not merely as a witness but as someone who has lived through the turbulent times of J&K, bearing its grief, enduring its silences, and holding on to its fragile hopes,"" Mehbooba wrote.Just over a week ago, a second ""key eyewitness"" identified Yasin in a Jammu court as the ""main shooter"" in the 1990 terrorist attack in which four unarmed IAF personnel waiting for a staff bus in Srinagar were killed and 22 others wounded.The unnamed witness's testimony came 22 months after a retired IAF colleague of the victims first identified the JKLF chief as the main armed assailant.","Shafat Ahmed Shangloo had a Rs 10 lakh bounty on his head.

Can give life convict bail during pendency of appeal if he has a fair chance of acquittal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-give-life-convict-bail-during-pendency-of-appeal-if-he-has-a-fair-chance-of-acquittal-sc/articleshow/125706804.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a liberal approach in granting relief to convicts, Supreme Court has held that even a life convict can be released on bail during pendency of his appeal if he has a fair chance of getting acquitted in a higher court.Applying this principle, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan suspended the sentence of life imprisonment of a Tamil Nadu police officer who was convicted and sentenced in a custodial death case which allegedly took place in 1999 in Thoothukudi police station. The court granted relief after senior advocate MukulRohatgi and lawyer Anand Verma pointed out the contradiction in oral evidence of prosecution witnesses (PW).""When the court is called upon to consider the plea for suspension of a substantive order of life imprisonment, the considerations are different. In cases of fixed sentence, the appellate court may consider the plea liberally unless there are exceptional circumstances to deny suspension. When it comes to life imprisonment, the appellate court should consider whether there is anything palpable or anything on the face of the record on the basis of which it could be said that the appellant has fair chances of succeeding in his appeal and getting acquitted,"" the bench said.The court said prima facie, it is of the view that the oral evidence of the PW 4 and the PW 5 respectively is in direct conflict on material aspects with the evidence of the PW 2.""The law is well settled. Conviction can be based on the evidence of a solitary eye-witness provided it is found to be wholly reliable. If it is found to be wholly unreliable, then there is no problem in discarding the entire evidence. There could be a third category wherein the court may find the evidence of a solitary eye-witness is neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable and in such a situation, the court must insist for corroboration in material particulars. We tried exactly to do the same thing by cursorily looking into the evidence of the PW 4 and PW 5 respectively. Prima facie, the oral evidence does not inspire confidence. In such circumstances referred to above, we are persuaded to accept the plea of the appellant for suspension of the substantive order of sentence pending the final disposal of his criminal appeal before high court,"" the bench said.",Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan suspended the sentence of a Tamil Nadu police officer.

NEW DELHI: Vice President C P Radhakrishnan’s first day as chairman of Rajya Sabha was marked by a warm welcome by treasury benches led by PM Narendra Modi and clashes between them and opposition as the latter raised the issue of ex-VP Jagdeep Dhankhar.PM praised Radhakrishnan’s contributions and said his rise from an ordinary background to the office of vice president reflects the true strength of democracy. The PM assured him that the Upper House will always uphold the dignity of the “esteemed institution and will remain ever mindful of maintaining your dignity as well”.Welcoming the new chairman, PM Modi recalled his past association with Radhakrishnan and said that he has always set himself apart by rising above the constraints of protocol. “In public life, there is a special strength in living beyond protocol, and we have always seen that strength in you.”But a clash between BJP and Congress members erupted as leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge recalled the sudden resignation of former VP Jagdeep Dhankhar. Kharge said any democracy in which opposition is not allowed to criticise freely govt policies will degenerate into tyranny.Kharge assured the chairman of Congress’ support, but urged him to treat opposition and treasury equally.“Fair and impartial conduct of proceedings, providing just opportunity to members of each party, is essential for credibility of this office,” he said.He referred to Dhankhar, who had resigned from the post of VP on July 21 over “health” issues. “I am constrained to refer to your predecessor’s completely unexpected and sudden exit from the office of the chairman, RS. The chairman, being custodian of the entire House, belongs as much to opposition as to govt. I was disheartened that the House did not get an opportunity to bid him a farewell. Regardless, wish him, on behalf of the entire opposition, a very healthy life,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju slammed Kharge: “I just want to remind the House that you have forgotten the language you used to insult him... The removal motion you served, a copy of which we still have...just think how much you have tarnished the dignity of the chair. My appeal is, please do not refer to anything which is not necessary on this solemn occasion.”Leader of the House in RS J P Nadda also criticised Kharge. Nadda said Radhakrishnan’s public life was unblemished. He ended his speech by quoting former President S Radhakrishnan: “We should behave like responsible members in Parliament and not as professional agitators.”Earlier, members appealed to the chairman to ensure that opposition gets a voice in Parliament. “This is the only forum where opposition can put its point across,” said Congress MP Rajiv Shukla.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Renuka Chaudhary stirred a row after she brought a stray dog to Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, disregarding protests from fellow MPs, while asserting that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.However Chaudhary claimed that she discovered the puppy en route to Parliament that morning.

It staged a resurgence overnight, amassing moisture. Drifting slowly northward at 5km/h and edging closer to the coast, the weather system thickened cloud cover over city and suburbs, setting off steady prolonged showers from 5am. It dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts Low-lying areas were flooded, children walked to school drenched, and traffic came to a crawl in most parts of the city. Around 10am, when most people were dodging potholes in traffic bottlenecks, India Meteorological Department reinstated an orange (very heavy rain) alert for the city and a red (extremely heavy rain) alert for Tiruvallur.Between 8.30am and 7.30pm, the city recorded “moderate” rainfall of 10cm, though it was heavy in some parts of North Chennai. Nungambakkam recorded 9.45cm, and Meenambakkam recorded 6.2cm. Ennore topped GCC records with 13cm of rain from 8:30am to 2pm, while Parry’s Corner, Ice House, Madhavaram, Saligramam, and Vadapalani each surpassed 10cm.On Sunday evening, when the cyclone weakened and the city was relatively dry, IMD withdrew the alert for Chennai to yellow (heavy rain) and Tiruvallur to orange. On Monday, weathermen said the system was likely to linger 30km-40km offshore along the coast and forecast heavy rain on Tuesday in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpet.Cyclone Ditwah’s path, however, continued to be a topic of debate. While IMD said the system would fade into a depression and cross land near Nellore early on Tuesday, independent forecasters said there would be scattered bursts in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet, and Kancheepuram. Blogger Pradeep John said he expected the clouds to regain as long as it was close to city coast. “The depression is going to stay for the next 36 hours near Chennai itself,” he said. Ditwah is neither able to move west nor east, he said. If this westerly trough influence moves away on Wednesday, then the cyclone will move west into TN or south AP coast into the land as a weakened cyclone, he said.","Cyclone Ditwah dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts.

NAGPUR: Nishant Agarwal, a scientist at BrahMos Aerospace Limited, who was arrested in 2018 for allegedly passing sensitive defense secrets to Pakistan intelligence operatives, has been absolved of the major charges under the Information Technology Act and the Official Secrets Act.The lower court had earlier sentenced Agarwal to 14 years in prison for allegedly using IT systems to transmit classified information to adversaries of the country. However, in a significant development, the higher judiciary has now cleared him of these charges.The only conviction upheld pertains to the possession of official documents on his personal device, for which the lower court had sentenced him to three years in prison.As Agarwal has already served this term during his detention, he is now eligible for immediate release.This ruling effectively ends the legal battle for Agarwal in the high-profile case that had attracted widespread attention due to the sensitive nature of the alleged breach involving defense secrets.Arrested in October 2018 through a joint operation by Military Intelligence (MI) and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, Agrawal was employed in the technical research section of BAPL, an Indo-Russian joint venture that manufactures BrahMos missiles.Investigations revealed that crucial documents related to the BrahMos missile were found on his personal computers, violating BAPL’s security norms.The chats showed that 'Sejal' was part of a group that shared data and tips on deceiving Indian defence staffers. Awasthi told the court that on Sejal's directions, Agrawal had clicked on links sent by her and installed three apps on his personal laptop in 2017.These apps were: Qwhisper, Chat to Hire and X-trust.These three apps were actually malware that stole data from Nishant's laptop, which contained classified information. Investigations claim that crucial documents related to the BrahMos missile were found on his personal computers, violating BAPL’s security norms.Nishant is said to have chatted with Sejal on LinkedIn as well, where she reportedly showed interest in hiring him, posing as a recruiter in UK's Hays Aviation.","Nishant Agarwal, a scientist at BrahMos Aerospace Limited, was arrested in 2018 for allegedly passing sensitive defense secrets to Pakistan intelligence operatives.

Chandigarh gang war: Former Lawrence Bishnoi aide Inderpreet Singh gunned down; Facebook post hints Sippa-revenge hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/gang-war-in-chandigarh-lawrence-bishnoi-aide-gunned-down-on-street/articleshow/125703770.cms,"Close associate of Lawrence Bishnoi and Goldy Brar, Inderpreet Singh alias Parry, was shot dead in Chandigarh's Sector 26

CHANDIGARH: Inderpreet Singh alias Parry, a close aide of Lawrence Bishnoi and Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar, was chased and shot dead in Chandigarh's Sector 26 on Monday night in what police said could be ‘gang war' linked to the murder of Lawrence's close associate, Jora Sidhu alias Sippa in Dubai last month.Parry, 35, was found dead in his SUV, riddled with bullets. IG Pushpendra Kumar said police counted ""eight to nine shots, but there could be more"". He was married barely a fortnight ago.A Facebook post under the handle ‘Hari Boxer Aarzoo Bishnoi' claimed it was revenge for Sippa's killing. ""A new war began today.Inderpreet Parry was murdered in Sector 26, Chandigarh. We (Aarzoo Bishnoi, Hari Boxer, Shubham Lonker and Harman Sandhu) take responsibility for this. Parry used to collect money from all the clubs by making calls to a traitor from our group, Goldy or Rohit. That's why we killed him.They started it. First, they tried to attack our Hari Bhai and later got Sippa Bhai killed,"" the FB post said, adding: From today, we have a warning for everyone: we will kill anyone who helps them… No matter which country they are in, we will reach everyone! No matter how much time it takes us.""Asked about this claim, a senior police officer told TOI: ""Yes, it looks like the handiwork of the Lawrence gang. We are tracking the social media handle.""This is the first gangland shooting in the City Beautiful after the Oct 10, 2020, killing of Goldy Brar's cousin Gurlal Brar in Industrial Area Phase-1, less than 3km from where Parry was gunned down.Parry and Lawrence Bishnoi go back to their student days at Chandigarh's DAV College in Sector 10. Parry was ""all colleges chairman"" of Student Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU) — Lawrence was a leader of the same outfit.Parry did student politics with him, and then walked with him into the world of crime, say police. Once, they were jailed together.He quickly racked up a long rap sheet and was arrested for murder two years ago. The trial was on when he met his end in a hail of bullets near Chandigarh's Timber Market.IG Kumar said, ""We received a phone call at the police control room (PCR) that someone in a car had been shot. A police team responded swiftly and took Parry to hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. We found signs of multiple gunshots at the spot, prima facie eight to nine shots have been established, there could be more.""Kumar added that the victim's car was being followed, and it ""could be gang war"". Police were trying to establish how many people were in the chase car and how many shooters, he said.According to initial police assessment, the shooters were likely acquainted with Parry, who was embroiled in multiple criminal cases over the years. Police are examining CCTV footage from the vicinity to trace the attackers' movements and reconstruct Parry's route.Parry faced several cases in Chandigarh and Punjab, one of which dates back 14 years. According to the FIR, on June 28, 2011, Lawrence and five others — armed with a pistol and swords — stormed into a house in Sector 40 around 8:45pm, assaulted the residents and threatened to kill them. Parry was among those arrested in the case. Lawrence too was nabbed on July 30, 2011, and police filed the chargesheet in April 2012 in Chandigarh district court. The trial remains pending.Parry's name surfaced repeatedly in police records over the past decade. He and several members of the Lawrence Bishnoi network were once charged by UT Police for making extortion calls — an operation that led to his arrest. On March 16, 2022, police picked him up from his Sector 33 residence and seized a pistol and 10 bullets from him. His interrogation led to the recovery of more weapons, including a Glock pistol with ammunition and a US-made rifle. He was later released on bail.His brushes with the law predate that incident. In July 2017, Parry was arrested alongside gangster Bharat Bhushan, commonly known as Bhola Shooter, in Sector 63. Bhola —who carried a Rs 50,000 reward then — allegedly murdered Lavi Deora of the Vicky Gounder gang in Kotkapura just two weeks earlier.Parry was arrested in 2023 by Punjab Police from a hotel in Himachal Pradesh for his alleged role in the murder of a Dera Sacha Sauda follower.","Inderpreet Singh alias Parry was shot dead in Chandigarh's Sector 26 on Monday night.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Police said caste differences between the two families were at the heart of the crime, according to news agency PTI.Aanchal Mamidwar’s brothers, Himesh and Sahil (25), along with their father Gajanan Mamidwar (45), have been arrested for murder, according to officials. The family allegedly opposed Aanchal’s three-year relationship with Saksham on caste grounds, a claim she reiterated in her statement.Superintendent of Police Abinash Kumar said an Additional SP-level officer would probe Aanchal’s allegations that two policemen had provoked her brother before the murder. Videos of her symbolic wedding at Saksham’s home and her demand for justice have since gone viral.Aanchal, in a detailed account, claimed the chain of events began on the morning of the murder when her brother took her to the Itwara police station and urged her to file a complaint against Saksham.“Two police officials told him he should kill the man I love rather than fight with others,” she alleged. “My brother, in anger, told them he would come back to the station after killing Saksham.”She said she only learnt of Saksham’s murder later that day — while reading a newspaper inside the same police station.The incident took place on Thursday evening when Saksham was standing with friends in the old Ganj area. A fight broke out between him and Himesh, who allegedly shot Saksham in the ribs and then struck him on the head with a tile, killing him on the spot.Aanchal said her family had long threatened Saksham over their inter-caste relationship. “My father and brothers have finally done what they always warned. I want justice. I want the accused to be hanged,” she said. She also alleged that her father and brothers had a history of violent behaviour and had “managed” previous cases with the police.Police said both Saksham and Himesh had criminal records and were once close friends.Six people have been booked under sections related to murder, unlawful assembly, rioting, and relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Arms Act. The arrested accused have been remanded to three days’ police custody.SP Kumar said Aanchal had not mentioned police involvement in her initial statement, but her allegations have now been recorded for further investigation.Police confirmed that the Mamidwar family’s strong opposition to the relationship — and the couple’s refusal to end it — ultimately triggered the killing, followed by Aanchal’s symbolic wedding as a public stand for justice.","Aanchal Mamidwar’s brothers, Himesh and Sahil (25), along with their father Gajanan Mamidwar (45), have been arrested for murder.

MEERUT: A headmaster working as an assistant booth-level officer for the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls died of a heart attack in Sambhal district on Monday, becoming the eighth person to die during SIR duty in Uttar Pradesh in 10 days, with three of them taking their own lives.The family of Arvind Kumar, 40, a resident of Chaukuuni village in Nakhasa police station limits of Sambhal, claimed he had been under immense stress due to the mounting pressure of the revision work assigned to him. He is survived by his wife, Pratibha, and two children—13-year-old daughter Garima and 10-year-old son Lavish—who study at a school in Amroha district.Kumar was posted as headmaster at the govt primary school in Faiyaznagar village under Hasanpur block of Amroha district. A family member said, ""His wife, Pratibha, tried to wake him early on Monday morning, but he remained unresponsive. We called villagers for help, but he had died by the time they arrived.""Lal Singh, Kumar's brother-in-law and also his working partner during the SIR exercise, confirmed that he was actively on duty as an assistant for the revision of voter lists. Singh said there was significant pressure on BLOs to meet targets and that the urgency around the work had deeply affected Kumar.He added, ""If Election Commissioner Gyanesh Prakash had extended the deadline earlier—like it has now been extended till Dec 11 — this incident would not have occurred. If more time had been given earlier, there would not have been this much pressure.""Though headmasters mainly handle school administration, they are often put on BLO duty as per Election Commission rules that allow govt teachers in Group C and above to be deployed. While Allahabad high court in Feb 2025 said teachers should be used only if no other staff are available, elections-related work continues to be assigned to them in UP due to limited manpower.Before Kumar's death, seven BLOs had died during SIR work in UP. Of these, three died by suicide. In Moradabad, 40-year-old Sarvesh Singh, an assistant teacher, left a suicide note describing his distress over digital form uploads, sleeplessness, and fear of job loss. In Fatehpur, 27-year-old lekhpal Sudhir Kumar Kuril allegedly took his life a day before his wedding after being threatened with dismissal.On the same day, Vipin Yadav, 35, an assistant teacher from Gonda, allegedly consumed poison; a video recorded by his wife mentioned pressure from officials. Four others died of medical causes. Shobha Rani, 56, a BLO in Bijnor, collapsed after days of illness and extended working hours. Sarvesh Kumar Gangwar, 47, from Bareilly, died of cardiac arrest; Vijay Kumar Verma, 40, a shiksha mitra in Lucknow, died of a brain haemorrhage; and Ranju Dubey, 44, a shiksha mitra in Deoria, also died of a heart attack.

Three people, including a labourer working beneath the structure, were injured, while a scooter rider was killed.Traffic on the highway was completely halted, and the damaged bridge was closed to all vehicles. The injured were taken to Bareilly Civil Hospital and later referred to AIIMS Bhopal in critical condition.The administration suspended MPRDC manager A A Khan, citing negligence in maintenance. Show-cause notices were also issued to the current and former divisional managers and assistant general managers.A three-member inquiry panel headed by the chief engineer was constituted and asked to submit its report within seven days. Senior officials, including the SDOP, tehsildar, and station in-charge, reached the spot soon after the accident.Repair and strengthening work were underway under the bridge at the time of the collapse. Six labourers were present below the structure; most managed to run to safety, though one was injured by falling debris.Of the five total injured, one sustained minor injury. Four with major injuries were identified as Devendra Dhakad, Devendra Lodhi, Jagdish Kewat, and Mahesh Kewat. Jagdish and Mahesh were on a motorcycle, while Devendra Dhakad was on a scooter—both vehicles fell into the gap as the bridge collapsed. Devendra Lodhi was among the labourers working near the bridge.Devendra Dhakad, 29, died during treatment at AIIMS Bhopal on Monday evening.SP Raisen, Ashutosh Gupta, said, ""Our teams rushed to the spot as soon as we received information. The injured were taken to the hospital, and traffic on the route was diverted as a long bottleneck formed.""The incident triggered an uproar in the state Assembly, with Congress MLAs alleging that despite ongoing repair work, traffic was not stopped or diverted, reflecting serious negligence.Congress MLA Vikrant Bhuria said repeated bridge collapses expose ""large-scale corruption"" in the govt. He also pointed out that the incident occurred in the constituency of the Union agriculture minister.PWD minister Rakesh Singh responded that the bridge was already under repair and collapsed during ongoing work. He added that he spoke to the MPRDC MD and instructed action against responsible engineers. On corruption allegations, Singh said the bridges were originally built during the Congress regime.Heavy police presence has been deployed. The highway remains closed, causing significant inconvenience to commuters. The collector later visited AIIMS Bhopal to meet the injured and assured families that the administration is providing all possible assistance.With the bridge shut, traffic is being routed via the old culvert in Nayagaon village. A temporary diversion is also being created by laying Hume pipes near the collapsed portion.","A portion of the bridge on the Bareilly–Pipariya state highway in Madhya Pradesh collapsed suddenly on Monday.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Monday, sharply criticised federal immigration raids, calling them “cruel and inhumane” and arguing they fail to advance public safety. The remarks came after more than a dozen protesters were arrested during a violent confrontation with federal agents in lower Manhattan over the weekend.Speaking to reporters Monday, Mamdani referred to his meeting with the President Donald Trump, and said he had conveyed to him that these raids are doing no good.“When I met the President I made it very clear that these kinds of raids are cruel and inhumane, that they are raids that do nothing to public safety. And that my responsibility is to be the mayor to each and every person that calls this city their home and that includes millions of immigrants of which I'm one,” he said.Mamdani’s comment reflects his campaign promise to defend New York’s immigrant communities against aggressive federal immigration actions. The self-described democratic socialist - born in Uganda and naturalised as a US citizen - is poised to become the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor when he takes oath next month.Mamdani’s remarks came two days after a tense standoff in lower Manhattan where protesters attempted to block federal agents from exiting a garage during an ICE enforcement action, according to law enforcement officials. Demonstrators chanted “ICE out of New York,” locked arms to form a human barrier, and some hurled roadside planters at government vehicles. Officers responded with what appeared to be pepper spray to disperse the crowd, the officials said, reported CNNMore than a dozen people were arrested. Saturday’s confrontation follows a series of protests nationwide over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and came just weeks after a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street.A department of homeland security spokesperson said individuals “dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles” obstructed officers after social media posts “called agitators to ICE’s location.” Publicising federal officers’ movements “puts a target on their backs,” the spokesperson added, warning that “anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted.”","New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani sharply criticised federal immigration raids, calling them ‘cruel and inhumane’ The remarks came after more than a dozen protesters were arrested during a violent confrontation with federal agents in lower Manhattan over the weekend.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125708902,imgsize-1077224,width-400,resizemode-4/zohran-mamdani-and-donalfd-trump-ap.jpg"
‘Looks like the CEO shooter’: 911 call by McDonald's worker played during Luigi Mangione hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/looks-like-the-ceo-shooter-911-call-by-mcdonalds-worker-played-during-luigi-mangione-hearing/articleshow/125707292.cms,"



A Manhattan judge on Monday reviewed key evidence in the murder case against Luigi Mangione , including a 911 call from the Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested last year after a dayslong manhunt after he killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.According to Gothamist, prosecutors played the 911 recording in which the McDonald’s manager told a dispatcher the man in the restaurant “looks like the CEO shooter,” adding that customers were “really upset.” Mangione was arrested there on December 9, 2024, five days after Thompson was killed outside the Midtown Hilton in Manhattan.At Monday’s hearing, prosecutors also showed widely circulated surveillance footage of a masked gunman firing at Thompson at close range. Mangione, appearing in court in a grey suit and checkered shirt, watched the footage without visible reaction and took notes, Gothamist reported.His defence team is seeking to toss evidence recovered during his arrest, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a handwritten notebook found in his backpack.His attorneys argue police conducted an unlawful, warrantless search. Prosecutors say the arrest and search were lawful and that the backpack’s contents tie the 27-year-old to the killing. Much of the same evidence is also being challenged in the federal case.Testimony from a Pennsylvania corrections officer who said Mangione was placed on “constant watch” at SCI-Huntington before extradition because the prison “did not want an ‘Epstein-style’ situation.”The hearing drew unusually large crowds as Mangione’s supporters — some dressed as Nintendo’s Super Mario characters — gathered outside the court holding “Free Luigi” signs and calling for “no death penalty.” A new photo of Mangione from court went viral on social media, echoing the attention he has received since his arrest.The judge in the state case is expected to rule on the suppression issues and could set a trial date in the coming days.","Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.

Tim Walz accused in $1bn ‘massive fraud’: Minnesota tax used for terrorism? Probe launched,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tim-walz-accused-in-1bn-massive-fraud-minnesota-tax-used-for-terrorism-probe-launched/articleshow/125706998.cms,"



A powerful US House committee and the treasury department have opened parallel investigations into allegations that more than $1 billion was siphoned from Minnesota’s pandemic-era food aid and other state programs - with some of the money allegedly ending up with Al-Shabaab.House oversight committee chairman James Comer told The New York Post that his panel “will conduct a thorough investigation into Governor Walz’s failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars,” adding: “Minnesota governor Tim Walz was warned about massive fraud… yet he failed to act.” He also alleged that “criminals - including Somali terrorists - stole nearly $1 billion from the program while children suffered.”Treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced a separate federal probe on Monday, writing on X that investigators were examining claims that “under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden administration and governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans’ tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.”The investigations follow federal prosecutions linked to the Feeding Our Future scandal, which US authorities say involved 78 people - many of Somali origin - accused of diverting federal and state food programme funds into personal spending on cars, travel and real estate between 2020 and 2022. The DOJ has convicted 59 defendants so far.A whistleblower group claiming to represent Minnesota department of human services employees alleged on X that Walz was “100 per cent responsible” for ignoring early warnings and that whistleblowers faced “monitoring, threats, repression.”The account was suspended on Monday.A June 2024 audit by Minnesota’s office of the legislative auditor found that the state department of education had “created opportunities for fraud” and maintained “inadequate oversight” during its payments to Feeding Our Future.A recent Manhattan Institute report cited by Fox News claimed federal counterterrorism sources had confirmed that “millions of dollars in stolen funds were sent back to Somalia,” where Al-Shabaab allegedly received a portion. Those details form a key focus of the Treasury probe.Walz’s office told Fox News Digital the governor welcomed an investigation “should a connection be found between Minnesota tax dollars and Al-Shabaab.”Walz, who is seeking a third term, has said he tried to halt payments to Feeding Our Future as early as November 2020 but was constrained by litigation. He later told media outlets he attempted to stop the fraud in 2021 but blamed a Minnesota district judge for allowing payments to continue. Judge John Guthmann rejected that account, saying payments were “made voluntarily” by the state.Walz has insisted he took “responsibility for putting people in jail,” while criticising Donald Trump, saying on NBC’s Meet the Press: “My God, there’s a big difference between fraud and corruption. And corruption is something he knows about.”Trump, meanwhile, called Minnesota “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” after recent disclosures.",Minnesota governor Tim Walz 'was warned about massive fraud... yet he failed to act' House committee 'will conduct a thorough investigation into Governor Walz’s failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars' Treasury department 'investigating claims that hardworking Minnesotans’ tax dollars may have been diverted to Al-Shabaab',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125707261,imgsize-622181,width-400,resizemode-4/tim-walz-ap.jpg"

Congress seeks clarification on legality









The White House on Monday defended a follow-up US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean Sea last September, saying the Navy commander involved acted lawfully, even as the episode triggered bipartisan calls in Washington for investigations and a parallel inquiry in Caracas into the deaths of Venezuelans.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Vice Admiral Frank Bradley, then commander of Joint Special Operations Command, operated “within his authority and the law” when he ordered a second strike on September 2 after an initial hit left survivors on the disabled boat. She added that defence secretary Pete Hegseth had authorised Bradley “to conduct these kinetic strikes.”President Donald Trump distanced himself from the follow-up strike, saying on Sunday he “wouldn’t have wanted that - not a second strike,” though he later defended Hegseth, telling reporters, “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men… And I believe him.”The Washington Post first reported that Hegseth had verbally authorised the second strike, prompting lawmakers across parties to demand clarity on the legality of hitting survivors no longer capable of fighting.Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said, “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”Republican Representative Mike Turner said Congress lacked confirmation that survivors were targeted but acknowledged, “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act.”Leaders of the House and Senate armed services committees have opened reviews into the September incident. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said oversight was essential but urged against “draw[ing] any conclusions… until you have all the facts.”Hegseth, responding to the Post report, wrote on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting,” insisting that current operations are lawful and “approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.”US signals continued operations as Venezuela protestsThe Pentagon says the maritime strikes are part of efforts to disrupt drug-trafficking networks in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. More than 80 people have been killed in these operations, including at least 17 in the first three attacks acknowledged by Trump.Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told congressional leaders over the weekend that he supports commanders “at every echelon,” and discussed the “intent and legality” of ongoing missions.On Monday, Trump met his national security team to consider “next steps,” including potential strikes on Venezuelan territory.

Walton County Sheriff says Ethan Ladner’s online threat was “not a joke”





Ethan Ladner, a 20-year-old man from Santa Rosa Beach in Florida, was arrested after he posted a scary TikTok video where he talked about a school shooting. Police said this was not a real plan, but it was still very serious. The FBI saw the video first and told the Walton County Sheriff’s Office about it. The video was removed from TikTok soon after.Police said Ethan Ladner admitted that he posted the threat. He told officers he only wanted people online to react to him. He wanted attention on the internet and thought this video would make people talk. But police said there is no joke when it comes to school threats. Even one small message can lead to big trouble. They said these threats can bring criminal charges, school punishments, and long-term problems for the person who makes them.Right now, police have not shared which school he talked about in the video. They only said they moved fast because the safety of students always comes first. This is why they acted very quickly when the video was reported. The sheriff’s office said they will always treat any school threat as real until they know it is not.The Walton County Sheriff’s Office said Ethan Ladner knew what he was doing when he posted the video. Officers said he told them he wanted to “provoke reactions online.”Police said even if someone thinks they are “just kidding,” posting any threat about hurting a school is never funny. It scares families, teachers, and students. It also forces officers to stop everything and investigate right away. They said this takes a lot of time and puts stress on the whole community.The sheriff’s office also shared a strong message for everyone who uses social media. They said people must think before they post. Words online can spread fast, and dangerous words can bring the police to your door in minutes. In this case, the video was taken down quickly by TikTok, but the damage was already done.Police have not shared more details about the video, but they said the investigation is still active. For now, Ethan Ladner is charged with making electronic threats of a mass shooting, and the case will move forward in court.Also Read: Candace Owens Net Worth In 2025: Podcast Earnings, Career, Charlie Kirk Controversy And More","Ethan Ladner, a 20-year-old man from Santa Rosa Beach in Florida, was arrested after he posted a scary TikTok video where he talked about a school shooting.

Candace Owens Fires Back With Shocking Challenge to TPUSA Pastor | WATCH

French officials say Candace Owens’ Emmanuel Macron claim is false





Candace Owens shocked everyone on 22 November when she said that Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron paid people to kill her. She posted this on X, and it spread very fast. Millions of people saw it, and many got scared because the claim sounded very serious. But as the days pass, her story looks weaker because there is still no proof. She has not shared any document, any recording, or any real detail that shows the claim is true.Candace Owens said she got an “urgent warning” from someone she called a high-level French worker. She also said she told the White House and U.S. security groups about it. But even after saying all this, she did not show anything real that supports her words. Her entire claim stands only on what she says, and nothing more. Soon after her post went viral, France responded, and their answer was very clear.A top French police group called GIGN quickly said the story was not true. They explained that they never do secret attacks on people and that their job is to stop terror, handle crime cases, and rescue people. French news outlets also reported that GIGN called the whole claim “fake,” which made many people question Owens even more.Then experts who study online rumors shared their views. One well-known expert said that Candace Owens had already repeated old false stories about Brigitte Macron in the past. Those stories were proved wrong long ago, which makes this new claim look like another rumor with no real base.As per reporters like Euronews and fact-checking teams looked into Owens’ words, they found nothing that supports her. There was no police report, no official note, no agency statement, and no outside witness. Nothing matched the idea that the Macrons tried to harm her. Investigators said the story looks just like other conspiracy claims that sound dramatic but fall apart when checked closely.Candace Owens still says she believes the warning she got. She says she has no reason to lie. But without any real evidence, the public now sees the claim as very weak.Today, the claim has no proof, strong denials from France, and many questions that Candace Owens has not answered. With each passing day, the story looks more like a false rumor that cannot stand on its own.Also Read: Candace Owens And Charlie Kirk Controversy Explained: Inside Her Statements On Erika Kirk, Emmanuel Macron And Mystery Around His Death","Candace Owens said she got an “urgent warning” from someone she called a high- level French worker.

‘Not Good Or Bad’: Trump Admits Maduro Call, Unpacks The Mystery Behind His Airspace Warning

US President Donald Trump delivered a blunt ultimatum to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during a recent phone call, telling him, “You can save yourself and those closest to you, but you must leave the country now,” according to the Miami Herald.The United States reportedly offered safe passage for Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and their son if he agreed to depart immediately. The offer was also said to extend to several top allies. However, Caracas refused to accept the conditions, prompting the talks to collapse.US President Donald Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro but refused to give details. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly.” His guarded comments came after he publicly warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered “closed in its entirety,” a declaration made hours after the failed exchange amid rising tensions and after the US sent major military assets to the Caribbean, adding to its tense standoff with Caracas.According to the Miami Herald, the call, held late in the week of November 16, stalled when Maduro sought two guarantees — global amnesty for himself and senior members of his circle, and the right to retain command of Venezuela’s armed forces even if he allowed free elections.The paper quoted a source familiar with the call saying, “First, Maduro asked for global amnesty for any crimes he and his group had committed, and that was rejected. Second, they asked to retain control of the armed forces … In return, they would allow free elections.” Washington reportedly dismissed both proposals and instead demanded that Maduro step down at once. Maduro government attempted to arrange another call with Washington but received no response. A defense expert familiar with Venezuela’s military and state-linked cartel networks warned that Maduro and key figures in his regime could now be facing their most serious threat yet.Following the breakdown, Trump sharply escalated pressure on Venezuela. He warned that US military operations “by land” could begin “very soon” and ordered aircraft to avoid Venezuelan airspace. A FlightRadar24 map later showed no international aircraft flying over the country. Flights to Aruba and Curaçao took longer alternative routes, and major airlines halted services after a Federal Aviation Administration warning about “heightened military activity. ” Venezuela retaliated by revoking the operating rights of several foreign carriers and accused Washington of “colonial aggression.”US politicians have defended the administration’s stance. Senator Dave McCormick told Fox News Sunday, “We have a war that’s coming through fentanyl, through opioids, through cocaine,” blaming Venezuela for fuelling a drug crisis that “killed 100,000 Americans last year.” The administration has intensified maritime strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, actions critics have described as extrajudicial. Congressional inquiries are under way into an alleged “double tap” strike near Trinidad, which US secretary of war Pete Hegseth has denied ordering.","The United States reportedly offered safe passage for Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and their son if he agreed to depart immediately.

Trump Slams Somali Immigrants With Asylum Freeze Announcement DC Shooting; Calls Walz ‘Retarded’





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday his administration intends to maintain a pause on asylum decisions for “a long time” after an Afghan national allegedly shot two National Guard members near the White House, killing one of them.When asked to specify how long it would last, President Trump said he had “no time limit” in mind for the measure, which the Department of Homeland Security says is linked to a list of 19 countries already facing US travel restrictions. “We don’t want those people,” Trump continued. “You know why we don’t want them? Because many have been no good, and they shouldn’t be in our country.”The Trump administration issued the pause in the aftermath of the shooting in Washington on November 26, that left 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom dead and another guardsman critically wounded.A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident. Lakanwal had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban, and entered the US as part of a resettlement program following the US’ withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday his administration intends to maintain a pause on asylum decisions for “a long time” A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125707508,imgsize-1038130,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Trump’s ultimatum and mounting military pressure





Caracas accuses Washington of seeking regime change









Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro responsed to escalating US pressure, telling thousands of supporters in Caracas that the country “does not want a slave’s peace” as tensions with Washington deepen.Addressing marchers after weeks of rising military activity by the United States, Maduro accused Washington of “testing” Venezuela with a naval deployment that has now entered its 22nd week and warned that the country would resist any attempt to impose political change by force.“We want peace, but peace with sovereignty, equality, freedom! We do not want a slave’s peace, nor the peace of colonies!” he told the crowd, before swearing “absolute loyalty” to the Venezuelan people. His comments came amid reports that Donald Trump had issued a blunt ultimatum during a rare phone call last month, demanding that Maduro step down immediately in exchange for safe passage out of the country.Sources told the Miami Hearld that during the call Trump had pressed Maduro to leave “right away”, offering guarantees for his family only if he resigned on the spot. Maduro reportedly refused and instead put forward counter-demands, including global amnesty and the ability to retain control of the armed forces even if he ceded political power. According to the Miami Herald, there has been no further communication since, despite Maduro’s attempt to secure a second call after Trump declared Venezuelan airspace “closed in its entirety”.The White House has neither confirmed nor denied the ultimatum reports, but Trump has intensified military pressure. A vast US naval build-up in the Caribbean is ongoing, airspace warnings have been issued, and suspected drug-carrying boats have been struck in a series of lethal operations that have drawn bipartisan scrutiny in Washington. More than 80 people have been killed in these strikes, which the US claims target narcotics networks linked to Maduro’s government.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump would meet national security officials to discuss Venezuela but did not rule out ground options, saying only that “there's options at the president's disposal that are on the table”.Maduro’s government insists the US deployment is part of a broader campaign to remove him from power and seize control of Venezuela’s oil reserves. In a letter to OPEC, he accused Washington of attempting to “appropriate Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – the largest on the planet – through the lethal use of military force”.Venezuela’s National Assembly has now announced its own investigation into the US strikes after acknowledging, for the first time, that Venezuelan citizens have been killed. Meanwhile, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro has offered Cartagena as a venue for new political talks, though neither Caracas nor Washington has responded.",Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro responds to escalating US pressure.

Presidential physician Dr Sean Barbabella released a memo describing the October exam as standard and its findings as “perfectly normal.”“As part of President Donald J.

Maga 'Civil War': Nikki Haley's Son Nalin BLASTS Ramaswamy's 'Third World Parenting' Style

Why he is in the spotlight: A pattern of hard-line statements

called for an end to legal immigration, including the H-1B visa programme, arguing it harms opportunities for American youth

suggested naturalised citizens should be barred from holding public office

described dual citizenship as “the stupidest idea,” questioning its loyalty implications

warned that some foreign students could be “spies,” urging tighter safeguards

distanced himself from his Indian heritage, saying his loyalty “lies solely with America.”

A narrative he insists is inaccurate

Gen Z politics and the Haley connection





Nalin Haley, the son of former South Carolina governor and Republican figure Nikki Haley , has publicly rejected claims that he is emerging as a political voice for Gen Z after reports portrayed him as holding views further to the right of his mother. Responding to suggestions that he represents a growing wave of disillusioned young conservatives, the 20-year-old posted a strongly worded statement insisting he neither seeks influence nor intends to speak for his generation. Instead, he said he was speaking out only because he felt “sickened” by what he sees happening in the country.In a viral social media post, Nalin said he has no desire to become a public figure or youth leader. “I never said I was the voice of Gen Z,” he wrote. “It was never my intention to get any platform and it still isn’t.” He added that he has no interest in podcasts, YouTube channels or monetising his opinions, claiming he turns down “95 percent of media requests.”Despite this, his recent remarks on immigration, citizenship and American identity have attracted significant attention. Some outlets framed these comments as signs that he is becoming an unofficial spokesman for a harder-edged Gen Z conservatism — a portrayal Nalin firmly rejects, stating, “I don’t care about that stuff.I have a life.”Much of the focus on Nalin Haley stems from the strong positions he has shared publicly. He has:These stances have led some analysts and media outlets to place him within a cohort of young conservatives who take more uncompromising positions than older Republican figures.The idea that Nalin represents a broader generational shift has been shaped partly by today’s political climate. Polling from the Pew Research Center and Harvard’s Institute of Politics shows Gen Z voters are increasingly distrustful of institutions and uncertain about political identity. Some commentators have viewed Nalin’s tone as reflective of this frustration.He rejects that interpretation. “I am only speaking out because I am sickened by the destruction of my country and the disrespect towards my fellow Americans, particularly those in my generation,” he wrote. His denial underscores a tension between his personal intentions and the wider impact of his public statements.Attention on Nalin has also grown because of Nikki Haley’s rising national profile. In a political era where candidates’ families are closely scrutinised, the younger Haley’s sharp remarks on immigration and national identity have raised questions about whether he mirrors broader Gen Z sentiment or is simply expressing his individual views.Analysts say his comments resonate with some conservative young people who feel alienated by economic pressures, cultural change and political stagnation. This has contributed to the perception that he is part of a wider generational mood, whether he seeks that role or not.Nalin Haley maintains that he does not aspire to be a spokesperson, leader or commentator. His posts convey anger rather than ambition, and he insists the media attention around him is misplaced.Even so, the intensity of his remarks and the reactions they trigger have already placed him within the political conversation. Whether he remains a private citizen expressing frustration or becomes a recurring reference point in debates about Gen Z conservatism may depend more on public interpretation than on his own intentions.","Nalin Haley, 20, is the son of former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.

When FBI director Kash Patel flew to Utah soon after his friend Charlie Kirk was assassinated, he was not ready to get down from the FBi jet. He did not his own FBI raid jacket with him on the plane and he refused to step down frpm the plane without wearing one, a new damning report has now claimed. The report is a 6-month report card on Patel's leadership by ex-FBI agents and while Patel was already embroiled in several controversies, the report added more to that.FBI special agents at the Salt Lake City had to pause their work on the Kirk case and ask around to find a spare medium-sized jacket that would fit Patel. A female agent's jacket was delivered to Patel on the plane but he complained that two areas on the upper sleeved tdid not velcro patches attached.Patel would not leave the plane “until he had two patches to cover those areas” so members of an FBI SWAT Team took patches off their uniforms and ran those patches over to Patel at the airport. The patches were then attached to the loaner FBI raid jacket and Patel disembarked from the plane.Patel was not happy with the investigation and yelled at Special Agent-in-Charge Robert Bohls for which Patel's deputy Dan Bongino had to later apologize, the report said.The report will be presented to the House and Senate Judiciary Committee this week. The writers of the report said that thet never intended it to be a hit piece but the anecdotes from FBI personnel turned it negative.The report concluded that Patel is ""in over his head"" and his deputy Bongino is something of a clown. The 115-page report described FBI as a rudderless ship and ""all f**ked up"".President Trump rubbished all the rumors that Patel would be fired and asserted that Patel had been working great.

An undated video of a speaker at a meeting of IT union workers in Seattle urging to kick President Donald Trump's bu** on the issue of immigration was doing the rounds as MAGA complained that the Indian tech cartel was ""openly bullying and cornering the President of the United States"". The video is not verified and it's not known when the meeting took place.""Kick the bu** of Donald Trump, kick his a**. Really,"" the speaker said to a huge round of applause. Then the speaker said she is always surprised when Donald Trump takes any anti-immigrant stance because two of his three wives were immigrants.

The rant came as Donald Trump paused immigration from third-world countries after Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal was identified as the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members.Wajahat Ali in his rant said that America has lost the battle and their mistake was to let brown people enter in the first place. ""I am saying this as a brown person. There's a lot of us -- 1.2 billion in India, more than 200 million in Pakistan, 170 million in Bangladesh. And I am not speaking about the expats or immigrants. And brown people breed. The problem is you let us in in 1965...you know what happens with brown folk? Our grandmother comes, our grandfather comes, our uncle comes, our aunt comes. Then our first cousin comes, second cousin comes. And then we have a bunch of kids,"" Ali said, adding that then there are some white women who like brown people.""So we have invaded. We are everywhere. There will be a Patel motel or a desi restaurant everywhere.I want you to realize this. You have lost. Your story is a sh**ty story filled with misery, your music s**ks, that's why your kids listen to black music,"" Ali said.MAGA added H-1B angle to the video and said that's how tech companies do not realize how they are importing Indian families after families while they are offering jobs to an H-1B.On November 28, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he will halt all immigration from ""third-world"" countries till the time he removes ""anyone who is not an asset to the countries, including those permitted by former president Joe Biden's administration. This is a Cold War era classification and is not used in modern times. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna criticized the usage and said his parents would not have been welcome if the embargo had remained in place.""Trump's threat to ban migration from ""third world countries,"" an outdated term, is returning to a pre 1965 America where immigration from nations like India was several restricted.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Kasim Khan claims his father has been kept in a 'death cell with zero transparency' Islamabad refutes rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was 'brutally' assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother.
