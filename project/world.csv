RANCHI: A disc jockey (DJ) of a sports bar in Ranchi was shot dead by an assailant after business hours following a clash between customers and bouncers, police said on Monday.On the run after the killing, police nabbed the man in Gaya and was identified as Abhishek Singh, a soft drink distributor of Ranchi.At around 1.19 am, close circuit television showed a shirtless man, wearing only shorts and his face covered with a cloth walking up to the bar and shooting Sandip Pramanik , a 30-year-old DJ from close range.As Sandip, who was preparing to go home, took a few steps back and slumped to the ground, the killer is seen taking the stairs in search of other members of the bar, who had mostly left.Police said Pramanik alias Sandy, was a resident of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal and was re-hired by the sports bar owner 20 days back. Police said the victim's relatives were informed about the incident.Officials said earlier in the evening Abhishek Singh and his friends were having a few drinks and got into an altercation with bouncers over dancing indecently in front of women patrons.“Following offensive behaviour by the customers I asked the bouncers to expel them and closed the bar at midnight. Police also arrived at the spot after getting information and took away one of the customers, who created a ruckus for questioning. At around 1: 20 am, I received information that Sandeep had been shot dead,” said Vishal Singh, who runs the sports bar.After the assault, Abhishek, who told police that he procured the licence from Assam, used the staircase and fired several rounds at the glass facade of the bar. He then fled from the spot in his car even as a second police patrol van arrived at the spot.Police rushed Sandy to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, where treating doctors failed to revive him.“He was one of the best DJs in town and had nothing to do with what happened in the bar earlier. He was an innocent man,” a bar staff member said.Ranchi SSP Chandan Kumar Sinha said a special investigation team under city SP Raj Kumar Mehta was formed to track the criminal. Seven sub-teams also assisted them with technical inputs. The Hazaribagh police in Jharkhand and the Gaya police in Bihar were also provided information about the killer and were told to surround him from different directions.The SSP said that Abhishek changed his vehicle in Hazaribag after he met with an accident, and he sent the car to a local garage. A case has been registered in this connection under section 302, 120B and 34 of Indian Penal Code.Abhishek told police that he had two licences and was living in a rented house in SAIL city.The police are trying to recover the weapon used in the crime.

""It is a magistrate-triable case. How can a person be kept in custody,"" it said.A vacation bench of Justices A S Oka and Satish C Sharma said, ""This is shocking that such matters are now coming to the SC. It is a magistrate-triable case. How can a person be kept in custody? See the counter filed by the state (of West Bengal)... should the accused continue to remain in custody for 10 years? It is very surprising that even in a magistrate-triable case, people are not granted bail, more so when the chargesheet has already been filed. As if these are some crimes against the nation.""The bench referred to the Birla-Lodha group fight and observed, “Only because two powerful private parties are fighting, such a situation has arisen. Sorry state of affairs.”The bench asked Bengal police to produce SPES trustee Krishna Damani before the trial court within a week for enlargement on bail after imposing appropriate conditions.When the Bengal counsel pleaded that instead of bail, SC could expedite trial, bench said, “In a magistrate-triable case, non-grant of bail is unheard of. We are on first principles, in magistrate-triable case, what is purpose of keeping a man in custody?”The significance of the case can be gauged from the appearance of heavyweight advocates — senior lawyers A M Singhvi, Mukul Rohatgi and Mahesh Jethmalani — for Damani, an associate of Birla group.Interestingly, an HC bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Sugato Majumdar on May 3 had denied bail to Damani and said there was “danger of the accused absconding if released on bail and the means, position and standing of the accused vis-a-vis the prospective witnesses in the case as well as likelihood of the offence being repeated, and evidence being tampered with”.",Calcutta high court denied bail to a trustee of South Point Education Society.

In addition to the engine fire at O’Hare, travelers at JFK International Airport faced a temporary ground stop on Monday as officials monitored powerful thunderstorms moving through the area. These combined issues underscored the challenges faced by travelers during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.The emergency response at O’Hare highlights the rigorous safety protocols in place to handle such incidents effectively, ensuring passenger safety remains paramount. While the incident was undoubtedly alarming for those onboard, the swift actions of the flight crew and emergency responders averted what could have been a far more serious situation.","A United Airlines flight was forced to abort takeoff at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon. One of its engines caught fire, sending thick plumes of smoke gushing from one of the wings. A total of 148 passengers and five crew members were onboard at the time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110480964,imgsize-954233,width-400,resizemode-4/110480964.jpg"

In 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously stated, ""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" Last year, he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering significant conservative backlash.Nevertheless, he delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals.In a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years.The document said practicing homosexuals and those with ""deep-seated"" gay tendencies and those who ""support the so-called gay culture"" should be barred.(With agency inputs)","Pope Francis reportedly used a derogatory term for the LGBT community during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops.

Argentina's 300% inflation spawns 'ghost' border town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/argentinas-300-inflation-spawns-ghost-border-town/articleshow/110478056.cms,"Paraguayan shoppers used to flock in their droves to the border town of Nanawa to buy cheap imports from Argentina, where the weak peso currency for years kept relative prices low for fuel, medicine and groceries smuggled in across the frontier.

Now Nanawa is a ghost town, with prices of the contraband pushed up steeply by Argentina's rare mix of near 300% inflation and a propped-up peso that has even rallied against the dollar in widely-used parallel markets under libertarian Prez Javier Milei.

""Before, things worked very well, we sold everything,"" said Marta, 57, a pharmacy employee in Nanawa. ""Now there is nothing left."" Shopkeepers in Nanawa estimated that sales had plunged between 60-80% since Milei took office in Dec when he sharply devalued the official peso currency and ushered in austerity. Since then the peso has been allowed to depreciate just 2% per month on a controlled 'crawling-peg', and monthly inflation - while slowing - has been some 10-20% each month. That's meant prices in dollar terms have soared.

In Argentina, products like olive oil and toothpaste are becoming small luxuries. Colgate toothpaste is priced at 4,976 pesos or $5 for a single 90g tube, twice what retailers charge in Paraguay and Uruguay.

This is all under the guidance of Iran's supreme leader and likely won't change after the helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister.The report, seen by AP, said Iran now has 142.1 kg of uranium enriched up to 60% - an increase of 20.6 kg since the last report by the watchdog in Feb. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kg, which represents an increase of 675.8 kg since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency.According to the IAEA's definition, around 42 kg of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible - if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%.Iran has maintained its nuclear programme is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make ""several"" nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran's centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment.The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its Sept 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear programme. The report also said that the death of Iran's Prez Raisi have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation.

NEW DELHI: The national disaster center of Papua New Guinea on Monday said that a deadly landslide that occurred on Friday in a secluded village located in the country's northern region caused major destruction and more than 2,000 people were buried alive.An official from the national disaster centre said in a letter to the United Nations , ""The landslide buried more than 2,000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,"" an official from the national disaster centre said in a letter to the United Nations.Search and rescue operations faced significant challenges in rural Papua New Guinea on Saturday, following a massive landslide that buried villages and claimed several lives.The affected area, encompassing three villages, is home to nearly 4,000 residents. Sandis Tsaka, the provincial administrator for Enga, where the disaster occurred, highlighted the likelihood of a substantial death toll due to the landslide striking a densely populated region and a key transportation route.Local officials initially estimated the death toll to be 100 or more on Friday. By Sunday, only five bodies and a leg of a sixth victim had been recovered.Emergency responders in Papua New Guinea were relocating survivors to safer areas on Sunday. This action was necessary due to the threat posed by tons of unstable earth and tribal warfare, which is prevalent in the country's Highlands.Longtime tribal warfare has raised questions about the accuracy of the official population estimate of nearly 4,000 residents in the village. This doubt emerged when a portion of Mount Mungalo collapsed.Justine McMahon, country director of the humanitarian agency CARE International, said moving survivors to ""more stable ground' was an immediate priority along with providing them with food, water and shelter. The military is taking the lead in these efforts.Medical facilities, along with houses, several small businesses, a guest house, school, and a gas station, were buried, according to officials.McMahon mentioned that there are other health facilities in the region. Additionally, the provincial government is dispatching health workers, and the World Health Organization is mobilizing staff.""There will be some support, but it's such a spread-out area that I think it will be quite a challenging situation,"" McMahon said. ""The scale of this disaster is quite immense.""Papua New Guinea is located in the tropics, but the village is situated at an elevation of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) above sea level, resulting in substantially cooler temperatures.","The national disaster center of Papua New Guinea on Monday said that a deadly landslide that occurred on Friday in a secluded village located in the country's northern region caused major destruction.

Tel Aviv Rocket Attack: Hamas' armed wing launches 'big missile' attack on Tel Aviv,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-claims-it-launched-a-large-scale-missile-attack-on-tel-aviv/articleshow/110440087.cms,"(with inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: For the first time in months, rocket sirens sounded in Tel Aviv after Hamas ' armed wing launched a 'big missile' attack on the Israeli city on Sunday.Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the missile strike, in a statement released on its Telegram channel. The group said the attack was carried out as retaliation for what it described as ""Zionist massacres against civilians"".The statement did not provide further details about the extent of the missile attack or any resulting damage or casualties. The escalation in violence between Hamas and Israel has been ongoing leading to a growing number of civilian casualties on both sides.Hamas Al-Aqsa TV reported that rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering rocket sirens in Tel Aviv for the first time in several months. The Israeli military did not immediately provide an explanation for the sirens.According to Israeli emergency medical services, no casualties were reported in connection with the incident.The rocket attack demonstrated that the Islamist group maintained the capability to launch long-range projectiles, despite enduring more than seven months of relentless Israeli military assaults from both aerial and ground forces.Earlier on Sunday, aid trucks entered Gaza from southern Israel through a new agreement to bypass the Rafah crossing with Egypt, following the seizure of the Palestinian side by Israeli forces earlier this month. However, it remains uncertain whether humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid due to the ongoing fighting in the area.Egypt has refused to reopen its side of the Rafah crossing until control of the Gaza side is returned to the Palestinians. As a temporary measure, Egypt agreed to divert traffic through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, Gaza's primary cargo terminal, following a call between US President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.However, the Kerem Shalom crossing has been largely inaccessible due to the fighting associated with Israel's offensive in the nearby city of Rafah. While Israel claims to have allowed hundreds of trucks to enter, United Nations agencies report that retrieving the aid on the other side is often too dangerous.According to Gaza's health ministry, close to 36,000 Palestinians have lost their lives during Israel's military campaign. The operation was initiated by Israel after militants led by Hamas launched attacks on communities in southern Israel starting on Oct. 7. Israeli figures indicate that approximately 1,200 individuals were killed and over 250 hostages were taken during these attacks.","Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the missile strike.

Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties.The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas.Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding.The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers).""It's a big mess,"" said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021.

Russia steps up covert sabotage campaign aimed at Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-steps-up-covert-sabotage-campaign-aimed-at-europe/articleshow/110477151.cms,"WASHINGTON: US and allied intelligence officials are tracking an increase in low-level sabotage operations in Europe that they say are part of a Russian campaign to undermine support for Ukraine's war effort. The covert operations have mostly been arsons or attempted arsons targeting a wide range of sites, including a warehouse in England, a paint factory in Poland, homes in Latvia and, most oddly, an Ikea store in Lithuania. But people accused of being Russian operatives have also been arrested on charges of plotting attacks on US military bases. While the acts might appear random, US and European security officials say they are part of a concerted effort by Russia to slow arms transfers to Ukraine and create the appearance of growing European opposition to support for Ukraine. The officials say Russia's military intelligence arm, the GRU, is leading the campaign.

The attacks, at least so far, have not interrupted weapons flow to Ukraine, and indeed many of the targets are not directly related to the war. But some security officials say Russia is trying to sow fear and force European nations to add security throughout the weapons supply chain, adding costs and slowing the pace of transfers.

Nato and European leaders have been warning of the growing threat. PM Kaja Kallas of Estonia said last week that Russia was conducting a ""shadow war"" against Europe. PM Donald Tusk of Poland announced the arrest of 12 people accused of carrying out ""beatings, arson and attempted arson"" for Russian intelligence. And PM Jonas Gahr Store of Norway said Russia posed ""a serious threat"" after his country warned about possible attacks on energy producers and arms factories.

One of the first of the recent sabotage acts attributed to Russia was a March fire at a warehouse in London. Authorities say the warehouse was connected with the effort to supply Ukraine but have provided few details. Security officials briefed on the incident said GRU operatives used a Russian diplomatic building in Sussex, England, to recruit locals to carry out the arson. Four British men have been charged with arson in the attack, and one of them has been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. In response, Britain expelled a Russian military officer working for intelligence services and closed several Russian diplomatic buildings, including GRU operations centre in Sussex. The use of local recruits, officials said, has been a hallmark of the sabotage campaign. They said it is to make them appear to be result of domestic opposition to supporting Ukraine.

'US fears 'October Surprise' from Russia and North Korea',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-fears-october-surprise-from-russia-and-north-korea/articleshow/110467766.cms,"NEW DELHI: White House officials are reportedly anxious about the possibility that Russia and North Korea might escalate geopolitical tensions just before the upcoming US presidential election . This potential maneuver is seen as an effort to assist Republican candidate Donald Trump in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden .According to NBC News, the Biden administration is ""increasingly concerned"" about the growing relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Six senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the White House is preparing for the possibility of provocative military actions by North Korea, allegedly at Putin's behest, as a strategic move to influence the November election.A US intelligence official said, “We have no doubt that North Korea will be provocative this year. It’s just a matter of how escalatory it is.” The concept of an ""October surprise"" refers to an unexpected event occurring shortly before the election, potentially swaying voter opinion. The theory suggests that increased turmoil in global hotspots, alongside the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, could drive American voters to seek a change in leadership.Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee, has been polling ahead of Biden in several key swing states. He has attributed the current conflicts to Biden's leadership, arguing that his perceived weakness has led to these international crises.In the 2016 US election, Democrats accused Russia of interference, though Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation concluded there was no collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign. Despite this, U.S. media reports have continued to allege Russian meddling in the 2024 race. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied any interference in past or future U.S. elections.North Korea has intensified its missile tests since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February 2022, heightening tensions with both South Korea and Washington. The Biden administration anticipates a possible nuclear warhead test from Pyongyang, which would be its first since 2017. A US official asserted that Washington is ""ready and prepared"" to respond to any such test.US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin noted last month that increasing strategic cooperation with Putin was emboldening Kim. He highlighted the ""growing nexus"" between Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, saying, “This is something that we are watching very closely.”","The Biden administration is ""increasingly concerned"" about the growing relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

VALLEY VIEW: Powerful storms killed at least 18 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter in a restroom during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US.The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City.Kentucky governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing ""multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.""Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff.Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, eight people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region.In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said.""The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,"" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month.Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April.Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot.""A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'"" Parra said. ""The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.""Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas.No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, Abbott said, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case.Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity.The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said.In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said.In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said.

The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday.

He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed.As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said.""They were conscious but severely injured,"" Dorantes said.The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms.By late Sunday, more than 80,000 customers in Arkansas were without power.

NEW DELHI: A high school English teacher at the esteemed Dalton School in America has resigned following allegations of sexual abuse involving a former student , according to sources reported by The Post.The accusations against Mara Naaman came to light in a letter dated May 2, authored on behalf of a student who had previously attended the Upper East Side institution, known for its $61,000-a-year tuition.Head of school José De Jesús and board of trustees president Aly Jeddy addressed the school community via email on May 9, acknowledging the ""serious matter"" and indicating that the alleged misconduct had occurred between 2020 and 2022.Naaman, 50, was promptly placed on leave upon receipt of the student's letter and subsequently tendered her resignation on May 6, as per De Jesús' email.The school administration took swift action, filing a police report and enlisting the services of a firm specializing in investigating harassment and sexual abuse.While the NYPD did not comment on the specific incident, they emphasized their commitment to taking sexual assault cases seriously and encouraged victims to come forward and file reports.The sudden revelation has reverberated throughout the Dalton community, with former parents expressing shock and confusion over the allegations.Naaman, who taught English literature to ninth through 12th graders and served as a house advisor, providing academic and emotional support, abruptly leaving her students without an anticipated source of guidance for college recommendation letters.Prior to her tenure at Dalton, Naaman held positions at Columbia University, Hofstra University, and Williams College, where she was granted tenure in 2013. Her academic background includes a PhD from Columbia, where she conducted research in Egypt.Despite Naaman's notable professional accomplishments, her reputation now faces scrutiny amidst the unfolding allegations.The Dalton School, known for its prestigious alumni and rigorous academic standards, declined to comment on the matter.This incident echoes past controversies involving the institution, including the association with late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who taught at the school in 1973, as well as allegations of sexual abuse against former headmaster Gardner Dunnan in 2018.As investigations continue, the Dalton community grapples with the fallout of yet another scandal tarnishing the reputation of the renowned institution.","Mara Naaman, a high school English teacher at the esteemed Dalton School in America, has resigned following allegations of sexual abuse involving a former student.

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.Taiwan has for the last two years complained of delays to deliveries of US weapons, such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as manufacturers supply Ukraine to support its defence against Russia.Michael McCaul , the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who promised those weapons would be delivered when he visited Taiwan last year, said the Chinese military's ""armada"" last week had sent a very strong message to the United States.""We are moving forward on those weapons systems. I'd like to see it faster, but they are forthcoming,"" McCaul told reporters after meeting Taiwan President Lai Ching-te.Taiwan needs to have sufficient weapons to show Chinese President Xi Jinping that the risk outweighs the rewards of invading the island, he added.""President Lai and I, as always, had a very sobering and yet very direct conversation about the threat that this island faces from its neighbour to the north, and it's a real one,"" McCaul said. ""Without deterrence, Chairman Xi has bold and aggressive ambitions.""The focus for Taiwan should be on maritime weapons like Harpoon anti-ship missiles, to stymie an invasion, he added.McCaul also offered reassurance that no matter who won the US presidential election in November, US support for Taiwan would remain.Lai, meeting McCaul earlier in the presidential office, said he would ""enhance national defence capabilities, and show the world the determination of the Taiwanese people to defend their homeland"".China has yet to comment on McCaul's visit. Last year, Beijing placed sanctions on him after his visit to Taiwan and meeting with then-President Tsai Ing-wen.China has increased its pressure against Taiwan over the past four years, including staging almost daily military activities near the island.On Monday morning in its daily update on China's movements in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected 21 Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships operating nearby.Later Monday, China announced military exercises to the west of Nanji island, off China's Wenzhou city in Zhejiang province and to the north of Taiwan.Taiwanese forces evacuated Nanji and the surrounding islands in 1955 under sustained Chinese attack.Taiwan still controls Kinmen and Matsu islands further down the Chinese coast.The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's Communists, who set up the People's Republic of China.","Taiwan has for the last two years complained of delays to deliveries of US weapons, such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.

The Chinese were working on Dasu hydropower project, which is about 300km north of Islamabad. The 4,320MW project is being constructed by China Gezhouba with funding from World Bank.“China attaches great importance to the important progress made by the Pakistani side on the investigation of the terrorist attack,” PTI quoted Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. “China calls on countries in the region to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, root out all terrorist organisations, remove their breeding ground, and protect the common security and development interests of all countries.”Earlier, Pakistani military authorities claimed the suicide bomber was an Afghan national. At a press conference in Lahore Sunday, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said: “The attack was completely operated from Afghanistan and planned to specifically target Chinese personnel in Pakistan.” He blamed the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and “hostile foreign intelligence agencies”.Pakistan’s allegation further strains bilateral ties as Islamabad continues to urge Kabul to take action against Pakistani Taliban based in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Afghan Taliban of allowing TTP terrorists to operate on its soil, a charge Kabul denies.Pakistan is under pressure from China as it has urged Islamabad to punish those involved in the attack on its citizens. Recently, Pakistan’s top economic body ECC approved a $2.58 million compensation package for the families of Chinese workers killed on March 26.Thousands of Chinese nationals are working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multibillion-dollar energy and infrastructure project under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese workers have frequently been targeted, mostly by Baloch separatist groups in Baluchistan, who view CPEC as a Pakistani govt ploy to exploit the province’s natural resources.",Beijing backs Pakistan’s investigation into the recent suicide attack that killed five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Islamabad accused Taliban authorities in Afghanistan of sheltering the “plotters” and demanded that they be handed over.
