‘No Internal Democracy’: Ex‑Congress Leader Shakeel Ahmad’s Bombshell Claims On Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Days after calling Rahul Gandhi “darpok” (coward) and “insecure”, former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad on Tuesday claimed that his residence faces a threat of attack. He shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp message which he alleged was circulated by party members, calling on district and assembly-level leaders to burn his effigy in protest over his “inappropriate statements” about Rahul Gandhi.Sharing the chats on X, Ahmad wrote: “Now my information has turned out to be absolutely spot on. Many thanks to the old mates from Congress. There's a saying in our Bihar that old friends are the ones who come in handy. Is this happening without Rahul ji's orders?”The message he posted read: “Former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad has been continuously making inappropriate statements about our respected leader Shri Rahul Gandhi. The top leadership has directed that all District Presidents and Assembly Presidents should, in their respective areas, burn an effigy of Shakeel Ahmad on 27/12/2026 to register strong protest.”Escalating the spat further, in a post late Monday, Ahmad further alleged that the Congress leadership in Bihar has ""ordered"" party workers to attack his residence.“Just now, some colleagues from the Congress have secretly informed me that the Congress national leadership has ordered the Bihar Congress/Youth Congress to attack my residences in Patna and Madhubani tomorrow, January 27, under the pretext of burning an effigy,” he wrote on X.The controversy follows Ahmad’s scathing remarks about Gandhi. “Rahul Gandhi is a coward and an insecure person. He does not get that 'boss feeling' before anyone who is senior to him or has a big public support. He is uncomfortable with any such person and is thus dictatorial and not democratic,” he told PTI.Congress leader Manickam Tagore hit back, calling Ahmad a “betrayer” and “Jaichand”. “I am not shocked. Just saddened, yet again,? by how betrayal becomes loud when courage walks the longest road,” Tagore wrote on X, adding that such attacks were about “TV time, relevance and pleasing new masters”.Ahmad, a former Union minister and ex-Congress general secretary who quit the party after the 2025 Bihar elections, has also accused Gandhi of sidelining senior leaders and influencing the 2022 party presidential poll in favour of Mallikarjun Kharge.",Former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad claims that his residence faces a threat of attack. He shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp message calling on district and assembly-level leaders to burn his effigy.

'I was held hostage'

Politics erupts over the incident

NEW DELHI: Calling the new University Grants Commission (UGC) rules a ""black law,"" Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri resigned on Monday, saying the new rules meant for higher educational institutions could foment caste-based discontent.Agnihotri alleged that the new UCC law would vitiate the academic environment in colleges and should be withdrawn immediately.Agnihotri, a 2019-batch Provincial Civil Service officer, sent his resignation by e-mail to Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Bareilly District Magistrate Avinash Singh, the officials told news agency PTI.The new rules notified by the UGC on January 13 -- the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026 -- have sparked widespread criticism from general category students who argue that the framework could lead to discrimination against them.The new regulations, introduced to stop caste-based discrimination in colleges and universities, ask institutions to set up special committees, helplines and monitoring teams to handle complaints, especially from SC, ST and OBC students.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government ordered disciplinary action against Agnihotri and attached him to the Shamli District Magistrate.In his resignation letter, Agnihotri said it becomes necessary to ""awaken"" the government when it adopts policies that ""divide society and the nation"".Talking to reporters after attending the Republic Day function Monday morning, Agnihotri said that the new UGC rules would lead to atrocities against Brahmins.The provisions were discriminatory and could lead to social unrest and internal discontent, he said.Levelling a serious charge against the Bareilly district magistrate Avinash Singh, Agnihotri, an alumnus of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) where he studied B.Tech and LLB, said he was held hostage and verbally abused, with people at the DM's residence saying: """" (Pandit has gone mad).""I was held hostage at the DM's residence for 45 minutes. A call came to the DM from Lucknow. I was verbally abused, and they said, 'pandit has gone mad (pandit paagal ho gayaa hai). Keep him hostage all night.' I had already informed the media about my situation. I was released at the behest of the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP),"" Agnihotri was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Avinash Singh, however, dismissed the allegations, saying that when Agnihotri came to see him, all the Additional District Magistrates (ADMs), Sub-Divisional Magistrates (SDMs), Circle Officers, Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) officials, and the Senior Superintendent of Police of Bareilly were present at the DM's residence.Political leaders, particularly the ruling BJP's rivals, reacted to the development, saying that the resignation was a serious indicator of administrative pressure.Reacting to the development, state Congress president Ajay Rai called Agnihotri's resignation a serious issue.In an X post in Hindi, Rai wrote, ""The lathi charge on Shankaracharya (Avimukteshwaranand) and his disciples, and the administrative pressure -- all this shows that under the BJP rule, the Constitution, faith and freedom of expression are all under threat. The truth must come out. The state will be governed by the Constitution, not by fear,"" he wrote.Senior Samajwadi Party leader and former Bareilly MP Praveen Singh Aron also responded to the development.""The true strength of governance lies in upholding the principles of righteous rule (Raj Dharma) and constitutional values. This is not a question of politics, but of the very soul of democracy,"" he added.Meanwhile, Brahmin leaders have been gathering at the state guest house in Bareilly since Monday afternoon.A resident of Kanpur Nagar, Agnihotri previously served as a sub-divisional magistrate in key districts, including Unnao, Balrampur, and Lucknow.

Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan but the party's criticism of govt for not offering them front row seats in the parade triggered a row, with BJP accusing it of carrying a sense of entitlement. Congress, however, accused BJP of ""petty politicking"".Party MP Vivek Tankha said, ""I was shocked. Opposition used to be treated with respect. BJP leaders of opposition were never treated in this manner. By seating Kharge and Rahul in the back, you are insulting the Constitution. But it is too much to expect grace and respect for opposition from BJP govt. It would be part of a party's behaviour only if it has fought for freedom of the country and for the Constitution.""This is not the first time that seating arrangement at the parade has triggered a controversy. In 2018, Congress objected to seating of Rahul claiming he was given a seat in one of the fourth to sixth row instead of the front row as he was chief of a party. In 2024 I-Day celebrations at Red Fort, controversy again erupted after Rahul was seated in the second-last row with Olympic medalists.Hitting back at Tankha, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Congress and Rahul suffer from a sense of entitlement and they believe VVIP treatment for them is more important than the country.Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal was sitting behind Rahul, he added.""Seating arrangement is decided by a set format, which goes by order of precedence,"" he said. He noted Rahul often skipped important official events, I-Day and swearing-in ceremonies of vice president and CJI.BJP recalled their own LoPs Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley used to be given back row seats when Congress-led UPA was in office. At R-Day function in 2009, a veteran politician like L K Advani was seated in the back row, one of them recalled. Poonawalla accused Rahul of insulting North-East by allegedly refusing to wear a 'patka' offered by President Murmu to guests at the 'At Home' reception.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""From the President and the PM to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the 'patka' with respect and pride. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards North-East..."" Sarma demanded an apology from Rahul.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

GURGAON: A food vendor abducted a 23-year-old woman from Leopard Trail, a popular picnic spot in the Aravalis, shoved her into a borrowed Scorpio and drove around the city with police in pursuit in the early hours of Sunday.The food seller, Gaurav Bhati (25), abandoned the Scorpio and fled when one of its tyres got stuck in mud at Pandala village, around an hour after he had abducted her. Bhati has been arrested and charged with kidnapping and snatching. Police are waiting for the woman's magisterial statement before adding sexual assault charges, sources said.Late on Saturday, the woman and a colleague had driven to Leopard Trail. They reached around 1.30am and spent an hour and a half there. Bhati allegedly harassed the two when they were sitting in their car.When the duo confronted him, an argument started. Amid a heated exchange, Bhati allegedly snatched her phone and began running towards the Scorpio he was driving. When she chased him, he grabbed her and pushed her into the SUV, locked the door and drove off, sources said. Her colleague tried to intervene, but Bhati pushed him away.As Bhati sped away with her, the colleague informed police and shared details of Bhati's vehicle.Police tracked down the SUV using the woman's phone location. Sources said Bhati drove in random directions, going to Southern Peripheral Road, Subhash Chowk and Sector 74, before taking the woman to a secluded, hilly forested area.However, the Scorpio, which Bhati had borrowed from another food vendor, stalled as he drove through mud paths. When she screamed for help, he got off and fled. Police reached the spot and rescued the woman. The Scorpio's registration details took them to its owner, who told them Bhati had taken his car to buy liquor. Three police teams that were formed to trace Bhati arrested him within a few hours, police said.A forensic team visited the area and collected evidence. Location data is being analysed to reconstruct the sequence of events, police said.""A medical examination confirmed that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the crime. When Bhati was taken back to the hills for a recreation of the crime scene, he attempted to escape. During the bid to flee, he tripped and fell in the rugged terrain, resulting in a fracture to his right leg and injuries to the face. He was hospitalised under custody,"" a police officer said.After being discharged, Bhati was produced before a local court and remanded in judicial custody. An FIR was initially registered against him under BNS sections 137(2) (kidnapping) and 304(2) (snatching).Police later added sections related to custodial escape and obstructing a public servant in the discharge of official duties.","Gaurav Bhati, 25, abducted a 23-year-old woman from Leopard Trail, a popular picnic spot in the Aravalis.

PIO civil servant gets flak on X for negotiating Chagos deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pio-civil-servant-gets-flak-on-x-for-negotiating-chagos-deal/articleshow/127568529.cms,"Image: X@/BasilTheGreat

LONDON: An Indian-born British civil servant has found himself unwittingly under fire on social media over the controversial Chagos deal.Dr Francis Vijay Narasimhan Rangarajan was born in Delhi and educated at Cambridge University where he obtained a master’s in maths and PhD in astrophysics.Since March 2024 he has been chief executive of the Electoral Commission. Before that he led the negotiations over the Chagos deal in his role as a director-general at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). The Chagos deal, agreed in May 2025, is opposed by the Conservatives and Reform UK, and a large number of the British public.On Sunday night Rangarajan’s name was trending alongside “Chagos Deal” on X after it was revealed he negotiated the deal to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which Britain owns, to Mauritius, and then pay Mauritius millions of pounds a year to lease back the strategic Diego Garcia military base, used by US and UK forces.At the time of going to press, the FCDO had not responded to a request for comment.Journalist and former Tory MEP Daniel Hannan wrote on X: “Every former minister I have spoken to blames the Chagos fiasco on Vijay Rangarajan, the relevant FCDO official. But, in Britain, civil servants are never blamed for anything and, indeed, he is now running the Electoral Commission, which makes MPs reluctant to criticise him.”Former Tory MP Douglas Carswell wrote on X: “Vijay Rangarajan should be summoned to the bar of the House to explain his asinine deal.” British political commentator Nick Dixon commented: “So we let an Indian give away our territory to a majority Indian country? Did we lose a war or something?”An account called “Basil the Great”, with 265k followers, wrote: “INDIAN CIVIL SERVANT BEHIND CHAGOS DEAL. Vijay Rangarajan born in New Delhi has been revealed as the man behind the whole Chagos islands fiasco. An Indian giving away British territory to Mauritius, a majority Indian state. WHY ARE FOREIGNERS RULING OVER US?”The Chagos negotiating team, led by Rangarajan, “overstepped its brief and offered Mauritius too much”.“Officials were freewheeling,” said one political source, according to the UK Times.Last week US president Donald Trump had said giving away the land was “an act of great stupidity”.Although the treaty handing over sovereignty was signed in May 2025, the bill has not been ratified in UK’s parliament. The Tories on Friday tabled a motion in the House of Lords requiring the govt to confirm that the Chagos deal did not breach the existing 1966 UK-US treaty governing the use of Diego Garcia. Later that day the bill was removed from Monday’s order paper.India supports the deal. Last Sept PM Modi had called the Chagos deal “a historic milestone for Mauritius’s sovereignty”.","Dr Francis Vijay Narasimhan Rangarajan was born in Delhi and educated at Cambridge University.

‘Insensitive and insulting’: BJP says Rahul Gandhi declined to wear Assamese Gamosa; Congress counters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insensitive-and-insulting-bjp-says-rahul-gandhi-declined-to-wear-assamese-gamosa-congress-counters/articleshow/127567076.cms,"Congress hits back

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for allegedly refusing to wear an Assamese 'Gamosa' during the reception hosted by President Draupadi Murmu after Republic Day parade.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma accused the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha of “insulting” the people of the entire Northeast and demanded an unconditional apology from him.Taking to X, Sarma said, “Times may change, but the attitude of the de facto supremo of the Congress party , Mr. Rahul Gandhi, regrettably appears unchanged. In an act that was deeply insensitive and insulting to the people of the entire North East, Mr. Gandhi chose not to wear the traditional Patka, a symbol of the region’s rich cultural heritage, at the reception hosted by the Hon’ble President of India this evening.”“From the President and the Prime Minister to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the Patka with respect and pride. Mr. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards the North East. Such conduct explains why his party has lost the trust of the region and much of the country. Yet, this repeated insensitivity continues. Rahul Gandhi must issue an unconditional apology to the people of the North East for this affront,” he added.This comes after some media reports claimed that all guests except Rahul wore the Gamosa presented to them at the event.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said in a post on X, ""Shameful! Rahul Gandhi has insulted the north east and also disrespected our very hon'ble President.""Meanwhile, Congress leaders shared a picture of defence minister Rajnath Singh and asked Assam chief minister if he will demand an apology from Singh also for not wearing the patka.""Hey Himanta Biswa Sarma, will you seek an apology from Rajnath ji too? Or your entire strategy to fight anti incumbency is to pick up such non issues?"" Khera asked,Congress MP Manickam also slammed the BJP over the issue and termed Biswa “2016 batch of betrayer.”""The 2016 batch of betrayer must stop this nonsense. Why is @rajnathsingh ji not wearing the North east patka then?

KOLKATA: At least seven people were killed and 21 others reported missing after a massive fire tore through a warehouse complex in eastern Kolkata early Monday, trapping workers who had been sleeping inside units packed with flammable materials. The complex housed a decorators' unit and a factory supplying a popular momo chain.Police initially confirmed three deaths, but fire department sources later said seven badly burnt bodies had been retrieved. Identification was not immediately possible. Officials said numbers could change as search continued through smouldering debris.The blaze broke out around 2.30 am at a warehouse in Nazirabad of Anandapur - a densely populated neighbourhood off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, a major arterial road linking south and east Kolkata.According to missing-person complaints, 25 people had stayed overnight inside the decorators' unit, while three others were in the momo factory. Most of those missing are migrant workers from East and West Midnapore districts.Fire officials said the decorators' unit stored large quantities of thermocol and other highly combustible materials. Large stocks of soft drinks and packaged food kept in the warehouse may have further fuelled the flames, allowing the fire to spread rapidly across the structure.Ten fire engines were rushed to the spot, followed by 12 more in phases. Firefighters battled the blaze for hours, but pockets of fire were still burning well into the morning, hampering rescue. A bulldozer was brought in to clear debris. A nearby workers' mess and a residential house were evacuated as a precaution.Relatives of the missing gathered outside the blackened shell of the building, searching for signs of loved ones. Sonarpur resident Pankaj Haldar managed a frantic call to his family after the fire began, but the line went dead soon after, a relative said.""My father has been working here for the past seven years. There is still no news of him. We have found his cycle,"" said Nayan Haldar, standing beside a nearly burnt bicycle believed to belong to his father Basudeb Haldar, store-in-charge of the momo unit. Cops said efforts were under way to trace the warehouse owners and a probe was underway.",Blaze broke out around 2.30 am at a warehouse in Nazirabad of Anandapur.

Stage harassment allegation: Former TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty files police complaint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stage-harassment-allegation-former-tmc-mp-mimi-chakraborty-files-police-complaint/articleshow/127567223.cms,"Former TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty (PTI image)

NEW DELHI: Actress and former Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty has lodged a police complaint on Monday alleging harassment during a live stage performance at a cultural programme in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district.The incident reportedly occurred late Sunday night during an event organised in the Nayagram area of Bongaon town. According to the complaint, one of the organisers allegedly climbed onto the stage mid-performance, stopped the programme abruptly and asked the actress to leave without prior communication.In her complaint to the Bongaon police station, submitted via email, Chakraborty named an organiser, Tanmay Shastri, accusing him of forcibly interrupting her performance and asking her to step down around midnight. She later said the episode left her feeling “deeply humiliated”.The actor also took to the social media platform X to share her account of the incident, linking it to broader concerns around the dignity and safety of women and artists.Referring to the timing of the incident on Republic Day, Chakraborty wrote that while the country speaks of freedom and equality, “the independence and dignity of women and artists are still too easily violated”.Explaining the sequence of events, she said she had been invited by the Naya Gopal Gunj Yubak Sango Club to perform at the event and was asked to leave the stage mid-performance, in full view of the audience.She claimed that derogatory remarks were made on the microphone, which she said not only humiliated her but also damaged her public image. “I left quietly to maintain decorum,” she said, adding that she has now approached legal authorities and believes in due process.“If I keep quiet today, this behaviour will be repeated tomorrow. Dignity on stage is non-negotiable,” Chakraborty said in her post.However, the organisers denied the allegations, saying the programme was stopped due to time restrictions. Shastri claimed the actress arrived nearly an hour late and that police permission for the event was valid only until midnight.He said that the decision to halt the programme was taken keeping in mind upcoming board examinations of students in the area.“Mimi Chakraborty was neither insulted nor harassed, and the allegations made by her are completely baseless,” Shastri said, alleging instead that her security personnel misbehaved with him. He further claimed that the actress’s bodyguards forcibly removed women members of the club who had come on stage to felicitate her.Stating that the organisers had no intention to disrespect the actor, Shastri added that if she felt insulted due to any miscommunication, the club regretted the incident.Police said that the complaint has been taken on record and further investigation into the matter is underway.","Actress Mimi Chakraborty has lodged a police complaint alleging harassment during a live stage performance.

Six Sarpanches Booked in Kamareddy for Mass Killing of Stray Dogs Ahead of Elections

NEW DELHI: In yet another case of alleged mass killings of stray dogs in Telangana, about 200 canines were reportedly killed in Hanamkonda district. This takes the total number of stray dogs found dead in the state since December 2025 to around 1,100, according to animal rights activists.Animal welfare activist A Goutham, associated with the Stray Animal Foundation of India, lodged a complaint with police on Monday, claiming that the 200 stray dogs were brutally killed about a month ago in Pathipaka village of Shayampet mandal by administering poisonous injections.He alleged the act was carried out on the orders of the Gram Panchayat Secretary, news agency PTI reported.Goutham, who works as Cruelty Prevention Manager, said that he visited the village with other activists and spoke to locals, who reportedly confirmed the Panchayat Secretary's involvement.“The carcasses of the dogs were then buried in a graveyard,” he stated, seeking the registration of an FIR.A police official from Shayampet Police Station said the latest complaint has been added to an existing FIR connected to the alleged killing of around 300 stray dogs in Shayampet and Arepally villages.Earlier, nine people, including two women sarpanches and their husbands, were booked in relation to the killings.“Further investigation is ongoing,” the officer added.Several incidents of stray dog killings have been reported across Telangana in January alone. In Pegadapally village of Jagtial district, around 300 dogs were allegedly killed by poisonous injections on January 22.Animal rights activists blamed the village sarpanch and Gram Panchayat Secretary, prompting police to register an FIR under the relevant sections of the BNS and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act.Similarly, in Yacharam village, about 100 stray dogs were allegedly killed on January 19, leading to FIRs against the sarpanch, secretary and ward member of the gram panchayat.Another 200 dogs were reportedly killed in Kamareddy district, with six people, including five village sarpanches, booked for their alleged involvement.Activists have alleged that some elected representatives ordered these killings to fulfil promises made to villagers ahead of the December 2025 gram panchayat elections, aiming to address the stray dog menace.According to background reports, in recent weeks, mass killings of stray dogs have also been reported from Ranga Reddy and other districts, with carcasses often buried in pits. Activists have documented these incidents and continue to demand strict action against those responsible.","About 200 stray dogs reportedly killed in Hanamkonda district of Telangana.

Protocol and seating norms

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday accused the Centre of violating established protocol and undermining democratic decorum after Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge were seated in the third row during the Republic Day celebrations. The incident has triggered sharp reactions from senior party leaders.Leading the criticism, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned whether the seating arrangement met constitutional and institutional norms. In a post on X, Surjewala said the treatment reflected the government’s mindset rather than protocol.“Does such treatment of the Leader of the Opposition in the country meet the standards of any decorum, tradition, and protocol? This only reveals the frustration of a government plagued by an inferiority complex. In a democracy, differences will persist, but this treatment meted out to Shri Rahul Gandhi is unacceptable,” he wrote.Other Congress leaders echoed similar concerns, arguing that the decision diminished the dignity of constitutional offices. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the issue went beyond seating and reflected the government’s political approach.“Until 2014, opposition leaders like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and L K Advani always sat there.This is a very low level of politics by the government. Opposition leaders being insulted on Republic Day is unacceptable. Republic Day is the day when we all should be united and celebrate India's achievements that year,” he said.Tagore also shared an old photograph from the 2014 Republic Day celebrations to question the seating arrangement of opposition leaders this year.In a post on X, he wrote, ""This was in 2014—look at where LK Advani ji was seated then. Why this protocol mess-up now? Is it because Modi and Shah want to insult Kharge ji and Rahul ji? Leaders of the Opposition cannot be insulted like this, especially on Republic Day.""Senior Congress leader Rashid Alvi said both Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge held key constitutional positions and deserved front-row seating.“Rahul Gandhi is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and Mallikarjun Kharge is not only the Congress president but also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. They should have been given seats in the front row. The BJP is constantly playing with the dignity of Congress leaders,” he said.Congress leader Kumari Selja linked the controversy to a broader disregard for constitutional norms.“Protocols hold great significance. The country takes pride in the Republic Day parade, where we celebrate our democracy and the republic,” she said, alleging that the government repeatedly sought to belittle the office of the Leader of Opposition.The Leaders of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are placed alongside union cabinet ministers in the official Table of Precedence, which governs protocol at national functions such as Republic Day.According to the Warrant of Precedence issued by the President’s Secretariat, seating arrangements at state and ceremonial occasions are decided based on constitutional rank and office and not political affiliation.The Order of Precedence is a protocol list that applies to state and ceremonial occasions, including national events such as the Republic Day celebrations and has no application in the day-to-day functioning of the government.Under Article 7 of the Table of Precedence, the Leaders of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are placed alongside Union Cabinet ministers, after the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of India and former Prime Ministers.Rejecting the Congress’s allegations, the BJP said the seating arrangement at the Republic Day celebrations was decided strictly according to established protocol.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, in a post on X, launched a sharp attack on the Congress, accusing it of placing entitlement and family-centric politics above constitutional norms.“Once again Congress puts entitlement & ego, parivar and position above people. They feel parivar tantra is above sanvidhan tantra. Seating is decided by a set format – Warrant or Table of Precedence. One can see even senior Cabinet ministers around or even behind Rahul Gandhi but none of them made it an issue,” Poonawalla wrote.He also questioned Rahul Gandhi’s attendance at major constitutional events in the past.“Rahul thinks he is the owner of India? By the way why does he bunk important programs. Where was he during VP oath? CJI oath? I-Day program?” BJP's national spokesperson further wrote.The BJP has previously criticised Gandhi for skipping the oath-taking of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Vice President CP Radhakrishnan, alleging that such absences showed disregard for constitutional occasions.The party has also flagged Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge’s absence from the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort last year, though both leaders had issued Independence Day messages on social media.",Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge were seated in the third row during the Republic Day celebrations. The incident has triggered sharp reactions from senior party leaders. Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned whether the seating arrangement met constitutional and institutional norms. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the issue went beyond seating and reflected the government's political approach.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127554158,imgsize-1320412,width-400,resizemode-4/127554158.jpg"

Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: From leading contingents to showcasing India’s missile arsenal to presenting daredevil skills on motorcycles, women military personnel stole the show during the 90-minute 77th Republic Day parade on Kartavya Path on Monday.Akshita Dhankar, a flight lieutenant with IAF, was part of one of India's highest ceremonial events — unfurling the national flag alongside President Droupadi Murmu. “It is a matter of great pride for me... Operation Sindoor was not just an Indian Air Force effort but a joint endeavour of all the armed forces,” she said before the majestic parade.Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of an IAF officer, led an animal contingent that made its debut on Kartavya Path. The contingent included Bactrian camels from Ladakh, raptors (black kites), Zanskar ponies and indigenously bred hounds that are used by Indian Army in security, surveillance and logistical operations in border areas.Capt Samira Z Buttar, a fourth-generation Army officer, was the contingent commander of the Integrated Operations Centre tableau that showcased the success of Op Sindoor. A fourth-generation officer, Capt Samira had her moment of pride even as she was mourning the recent loss of her father, Col Sarabjeet Singh Buttar (retd).“Being a contingent commander during this Republic Day parade is a tribute to my father,” she said, putting up a brave front.The IAF marching contingent was led by Squadron Leader Jagdesh Kumar along with Squadron Leader Nikita Choudhary. The IAF band, led by Sergeant Charles Antony Daniel, supported the marching contingent and comprised 72 elite musicians, including 57 Agniveervayu and nine Agniveervayu women.Simran Bala, assistant commandant of CRPF, scripted history by leading an all-male contingent of India’s largest central armed police force. The 26-year-old officer, who hails from J&K’s Rajouri district, led the squad of 147 male personnel. Bala, who joined the force less than a year ago, is the first woman from the district to join CRPF in officer rank.CRPF and SSB all-women contingents also marched down Kartavya Path during the parade, led by assistant commandants Seema Nag and Naveen Kumari, displaying discipline and confidence. The high-octane display by women motorcycle daredevils emerged as one of the key highlights of the parade, drawing applause for its precision, balance and coordination.

NEW DELHI: India’s military offensive, courage and valour displayed during Operation Sindoor were showcased in front of European chief guests and thousands of spectators on Kartavya Path during the 77th Republic Day parade on Monday when the country made a grand display of lethal weapon systems, missiles, anti-missile shield and fighter jets used during the conflict against Pakistan last year.A glass-cased integrated operational centre, depicting the conduct of Op Sindoor with the use of weapons systems such as BrahMos and S-400 missiles rolled down Kartavya Path. Two key pillars of India's air defence architecture, Akash weapon system and ABHRA Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System (MRSAM) that formed a robust layered shield for the Indian Army during the conflict last May were also displayed.For the first time, the parade showcased a phased ‘Battle Array Format’ of the Indian Army that included an aerial component. A tri-services tableau led by Captain Samira Buttar depicted replicas of major weapon systems deployed during Op Sindoor against Pakistan. Even helicopters carrying Operation Sindoor flags flew over the Kartavya Path before the start of the parade.Besides Op Sindoor weapon systems, the military also flaunted the rocket launcher ‘Suryastra’, Shaktibaan, followed by Divyastra, equipped with cutting-edge surveillance and targeting technologies.Mechanised columns on display included BMP-II Infantry Combat Vehicle, along with Nag missile system (Tracked) Mk-2.In a first, DRDO showcased its hypersonic glide missile LR-AShM, which is capable of engaging static and moving targets and designed to carry various payloads.The parade was led by Parade Commander Lt General Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding, Delhi Area, a second-generation army officer. Among the 18 marching contingents and 13 bands, debut appearances were of newly-raised Bhairav Light Commando Battalion, Scouts contingent and a specially-curated animal contingent from the Remount & Veterinary Corps (RVC). Artillery systems on display included the Dhanush 155 mm, 45-calibre towed artillery gun and AMOGH Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), demonstrating India's long-range precision strike capability. For the first time, the Army displayed several drone systems, robotic mules carrying assault rifles, all-terrain vehicles and sharpshooters in the parade.A military contingent from the European Union, carrying the military staff flag and flags of Operations Atalanta and Aspides, naval operations of the grouping, also featured at the parade as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa were the R-Day chief guests. It was the EU's first participation in such an event outside Europe.In the parade, a high mobility reconnaissance vehicle and India's first indigenously-designed armoured light specialist vehicle also participated for the first time. The combat elements then followed with T-90 Bhisma and Main Battle Tank Arjun rolling past the saluting dais with aerial support from US-made Apache AH-64E and Prachand light combat helicopters.Before the starting of the parade, IAF Group Captain and astronaut Subhanshu Shukla was honoured with the Ashok Chakra by President Droupadi Murmu for his historic ISS space mission.A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighter jets like Rafale and Sukhois — that were used in Op Sindoor— four transport aircraft and nine helicopters, participated in the flypast.The IAF deployed around 20 fighter jets along with Netra AEW&C aircraft, to create an aerial shield against any possible threat to the R-day celebrations in New Delhi.","India's military offensive, courage and valour displayed during Operation Sindoor were showcased in front of European chief guests.

DEHRADUN: Close on the heels of a proposal to restrict the entry of non-Hindus at 105 ghats in the Kumbh area at Haridwar, Badrinath Kedarnath Temple Committee (BKTC), which administers the Char Dham shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath and 47 other temples, is considering a similar move at the shrines under it. The proposal is expected to be placed before BKTC board soon, and has the support of most stakeholders, as per sources.BKTC chairman Hemant Dwivedi told TOI the proposed restriction was rooted in ""long-standing tradition"".""This has been followed since the time of Adi Shankaracharya. We see nothing wrong in preserving religious traditions,"" he said, adding that the ""entry for non-Hindus has historically been restricted at the shrines"".Citing Article 26 of Constitution, which grants religious denominations the right to manage their own affairs, Dwivedi said the committee was well within its rights to take such a decision. Dwivedi also sought to clarify that the term ""non-Hindus"" should not be misconstrued. ""Those who respect our faith are welcome. The dhams are centres of faith, not tourism.""Meanwhile, Uttarakhand govt is weighing a ban on the entry of non-Hindus at 105 ghats across Haridwar and considering declaring Haridwar and Rishikesh as 'sanatan pavitra shehar' (holy cities).

Watch: Padma Shri 2026 Awardees Beam With Joy as Lifelong Work Gets Honoured

NEW DELHI: RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve, was instrumental in blowing the lid off the two contradictory affidavits filed by the UPA govt in 2009, under his signature, in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case.While the first affidavit had cited pinpointed inputs by central intelligence agencies establishing Jahan as part of an LeT module tasked to assassinate high-level political functionaries in India, the subsequent affidavit went on to dismiss the evidentiary value of these intelligence inputs and distanced the Centre from Gujarat govt's action based on the inputs.It was several years later that Mani went public, indirectly claiming ""political interference"" to revise the affidavit. Mani owned up to having drafted the first affidavit filed on Aug 6, 2009, based on intelligence reports he had seen and found to be ""precise, accurate and exact"". He said the reports had clear details regarding terror antecedents of the four-member module, comprising Jahan, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Jishan Johar and Amjad Ali, and laid down the sequence of events leading up to the encounter in Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004, in which all four were neutralised.The original affidavit cited Indian newspaper reports based on the claim made in LeT mouthpiece 'Ghazwa Times' that ""the veil of Ishrat Jahan, a woman activist of LeT, was removed by Indian police and her body kept with other 'mujahideens (terrorists)'"", as a confirmation of her terror links. However, in a subsequent affidavit filed on Sept 29, 2009, MHA said all intel inputs do not constitute conclusive proof and it is for state govt and state police to act on such inputs. It was submitted Centre was in no way concerned with such action and does not condone or endorse any unjustified or excessive action. While the first affidavit said the case was not fit for investigation by CBI, the second said the Centre would not object to an independent inquiry or CBIprobe.Mani had later said the second affidavit was not drafted by him and that he had signed and filed it as he was under orders. According to a statement made in 2016 by then home minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament, the second affidavit (in 2009) was vetted by the then attorney general and approved by the then home minister (P Chidambaram). Notings on the file did not mention any reason for revising the affidavit. Rajnath's statement also cited testimony of 26/11 accused and American LeT operative David Coleman Headley, confirming Jahan as ""a female terrorist"" killed by the Indian police in a botched-up LeT operation.Mani had also said he was ""tortured"" by the chief of SIT when summoned in 2013. Mani has penned several books based on the central theme of political interference in terror investigations, including 'The Myth of Hindu Terror: Insider Account of Ministry of Home Affairs' and 'Deception: A Family that Deceived the Whole Nation'.","RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve.

Everything Fine, Says Shashi Tharoor After Skipping Congress Rally Amid Growing Speculation of Rift

NEW DELHI: The Congress leadership is likely to meet senior party member Shashi Tharoor after his absence from a brainstorming session on Kerala elections last week triggered a row, suggesting he was unhappy with the party.Sources said the party brass is thinking of inviting Tharoor for a discussion to address his grievances.Tharoor set tongues wagging after he stayed away from a meeting to which select senior Kerala functionaries were invited by AICC to discuss strategy for the upcoming state elections. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi chaired the meeting, which was attended by all key party members from the poll-bound state.While Tharoor, who was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival, said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the session, the Thiruvananthapuram MP also underlined that he has some issues with the party which he wants to discuss with the leadership. He even corroborated press reports about his unhappiness, saying some of them were correct.Sources said the thinking in the party is that the Kerala MP should be invited for a discussion to address his grievances.According to a party manager, the brass wants to ensure that the party is united going into the Kerala elections in which it believes the opposition alliance, United Democratic Front (UDF), has a good chance of dislodging the governing Left Democratic Front (LDF) alliance, its hopes raised by Opposition's strong performance in the local body elections last month.It is felt that Tharoor has his own pull with the electorate and should actively participate in the run-up to the polls to boost the party's prospects. However, the Lok Sabha MP has his detractors in the organisation who blame him for repeatedly taking a stance at variance with Congress and even being soft on BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The sudden emergence of wrinkles in the Kerala party organisation last week left many disturbed as developments of the last couple of months had indicated a new-found unity in the otherwise fractious unit. Tharoor not only attended party events like Lakshya but also clarified that he had never diverged from the party stance on key issues. But the supposed thaw was shattered by his absence from the AICC meeting last week.","Tharoor set tongues wagging after he stayed away from a meeting to which select senior Kerala functionaries were invited by AICC.

A century in uniform: Chandigarh girl carries 4 generations of Army service to Kartavya Path,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-century-in-uniform-chandigarh-girl-carries-4-generations-of-army-service-to-kartavya-path/articleshow/127567608.cms,"CHANDIGARH: A fourth-generation Army officer from Chandigarh, carrying a family legacy that stretches from the cavalry of the British Indian Army to post-Independence gallantry and modern-day integrated warfare, was among the commanding faces of this year’s Republic Day parade. Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path.

SRINAGAR:

After this season’s first major widespread snowfall last week, Jammu and Kashmir is once again bracing for heavy snowfall as another western disturbance was set to hit the region Monday evening.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a major advisory, warning that the fresh spell of snowfall could disrupt air traffic and key highways, including the Jammu-Srinagar national highway.In its forecast, the IMD said snowfall was likely to start on the night of Jan 26, preceded by strong winds for a brief period at some places. It said that on Jan 27, moderate to heavy snowfall is expected at most places across Kashmir and the higher reaches of Jammu.The IMD, however, said there is no likelihood of heavy snowfall in the plains of Jammu. On Jan 28, the IMD said, there are chances of light rain at some places and snowfall in the higher reaches of Kashmir.Sonam Lotus, head of the meteorological centre in Leh, said Srinagar is likely to receive moderate to heavy snowfall. Lotus, who earlier headed the meteorological centre in J&K state, is widely known across Kashmir for his weather forecasts.He said that on Tuesday morning, Srinagar will receive snowfall but the accumulation will not be much. He said there is a possibility of three to four inch of snow accumulation. Last week’s snowfall in the Valley didn’t touch Srinagar city, leading to disappointment among residents.After a prolonged dry spell this winter, the Kashmir Valley and Pir Panjal and Chenab Valley regions of Jammu witnessed heavy snowfall and severe winds reaching speeds of up to 155 kmph on Friday, which blocked highways, led to flight cancellations, shut down schools, disrupted power supply and left several homes roofless.Despite the disruption, the snowfall brought cheer among people. Youngsters in the areas, including south Kashmir districts which witnessed heavy snowfall, were seen playing in the snow and celebrating the change in weather. Social media in Kashmir was full with snowfall reels. Heavy snowfall has attracted tourists and social media influencers from within and outside the country to Gulmarg, which has come alive once again, with long queues at the gondola as hundreds of tourists thronged the resort to enjoy skiing and gondola rides.CM Omar Abdullah on Sunday also rushed to Gulmarg, took a snow scooter ride and also enjoyed skiing.","The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a major advisory, warning that the fresh spell of snowfall could disrupt air traffic and key highways.

SRINAGAR:

A proposed railway line from Bijbehara to the tourist resort of Pahalgam is facing growing opposition in Jammu and Kashmir, where political figures have joined local residents in protest, arguing that the project would divest them of vast agriculture, apple orchard lands and severely impact their livelihood.Bijbehara is a historic town in Anantnag district in south Kashmir and is located some 45 km from Srinagar.MP from Anantnag-Poonch, Mian Altaf, on Sunday met residents of Wulherhama village, whose apple orchards and agricultural land fall along the proposed railway alignment, and said the railway line would not benefit anyone. “It does not benefit the central govt, J&K govt or the people of J&K. We have to convey to the central government that this railway line will serve no purpose,” Altaf said while interacting with the residents.He appealed to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha and CM Omar Abdullah to intervene and write to the Centre on the issue.Several villages in south Kashmir have been opposing the project, seeking government intervention since Dec 2025, after surveys for the proposed rail alignment were conducted in several villages.National Conference MLA from Bijbehara, Bashir Ahmad Veeri, has described the project as ill-conceived and against public interest.Echoing similar concerns, NC MLA from Pahalgam, Altaf Ahmad Kaloo, questioned the need for the project. Kaloo, who joined Mian Altaf on Monday when the latter visited the area, said that National Highway-501 has already been sanctioned and land for it demarcated. “There is already a road to Pahalgam, and the parallel road has been declared NH-501. When land is scarce and a significant portion has already been acquired for the NH-501, what is the need for another 40-km zig zag railway line that will not help in any way,” Kaloo said. He said large tracts of land had already been taken up by the highway project, which is to be constructed soon.On Jan 22, PDP functionary Iltija Mufti visited the area and said establishing a railway line spanning hundreds of kanals of fertile agricultural and horticultural land and residential homes was ill-conceived, detrimental and, most importantly, environmentally unviable. She appealed to Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to scrap the plan entirely.Iltija said the government should consult the people before proposing such projects. “If a railway line is taken through agricultural and horticultural land, it will leave people jobless and homeless in a large number of cases,” she said.","MP from Anantnag-Poonch, Mian Altaf, on Sunday met residents of Wulherhama village, whose apple orchards and agricultural land fall along the proposed railway alignment.

The injured soldier was immediately evacuated to a hospital and is undergoing treatment.According to officials, forward areas along the LoC are part of an anti-infiltration obstacle system and are surrounded by landmines. During heavy rainfall, some of these mines can get washed away from their original positions, occasionally leading to such accidents.","An Indian Army soldier was injured in a landmine explosion near the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district.

Nice,” the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader wrote on X.Speaking to reporters, Raut also said that the Mahayuti government — including chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief ministers Ajit Pawar and Eknath Shinde — should condemn the decision to award the Padma Bhushan to Koshiyari, who had insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and social reformers Mahatma Phule and Savitribai Phule.He further claimed that Koshiyari wanted to topple the majority government of Uddhav Thackeray and install a BJP dispensation in the state.Congress leader Varsha Gaikwad also weighed in on the issue, claiming that the BJP has a long history of insulting Maharashtra’s great leaders and constitutional icons.“Honouring such a person with a Padma award is an insult to Maharashtra,” she said.Meanwhile, Koshiyari asserted that he does not work for “someone’s appreciation or criticism”.Speaking to news agency ANI, the former Uttarakhand chief minister said that he remains committed to working for “Bharat Mata” and the RSS .“I don’t work for someone’s appreciation or criticism. I am a worker of the RSS, and for me Bharat Mata is everything. I will continue to work for Bharat Mata,” Koshiyari said.However, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis backed the former Maharashtra governor, saying that he has contributed to society and worked for development.Hitting back at Raut, Fadnavis said that “small-minded people are opposing” the Padma Bhushan for Koshiyari.“Bhagat Singh Koshiyari has contributed to society and worked for development. The committee on ‘One Rank, One Pension’ was also chaired by him, and based on its report, the Indian government agreed to the demand,” Fadnavis said.“He has been conferred with the Padma Bhushan for strengthening India’s relations with Nepal. Some small-minded people are opposing it. Who received Padma awards during whose tenure is not something that should be commented on,” he added.Koshiyari served as Maharashtra governor from 2019 to 2023, a tenure marked by several controversies.When Uddhav Thackeray was chief minister, he accused Koshiyari of being overactive and pointed out that the governor had not filled 12 vacant seats in the state Legislative Council despite the state government’s recommendation.The former governor also faced criticism over his remark describing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as “an icon of the olden times”.","Bhagat Singh Koshiyari served as Maharashtra governor from 2019 to 2023.

Xi Jinping, Rubio, Ursula Hail India On Republic Day As Delhi Becomes Centre Of World Attention

NEW DELHI: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday extended greetings to President Droupadi Murmu on the occasion of India’s 77th Republic Day, describing New Delhi and Beijing as “good neighbours, friends and partners. ” He also said that achieving the vision of the “dragon and the elephant dancing together” is the right choice for both countries.In his message, Xi said India-China relations have continued to improve and develop, aligning with the fundamental interests of both countries and their people. He added that the relationship also carried significant implications for global peace and prosperity.According to China’s state-run Xinhua news agency, he stressed that Beijing has consistently believed that being good neighbours, friends and partners who help each other succeed is the correct path for the two Asian giants.Xi also expressed hope that both sides would adhere to the consensus that China and India are “partners for cooperation and opportunities for development,” strengthen strategic communication, expand exchanges and cooperation, address each other’s concerns and promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral ties.Highlighting Xi’s message, Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong shared a post on X, reiterating Beijing’s position on ties with New Delhi.Chinese Premier Li Qiang also sent a congratulatory message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The message comes amid a gradual improvement in ties between the two countries, which had stalled following the eastern Ladakh military standoff in 2020.Relations began to revive after PM Modi and President Xi held two meetings first in Kazan in 2024, and later in Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in August last year.During their August meeting, the two leaders agreed to deepen bilateral ties, tackle pressing challenges and work towards a “fair” solution to the long-standing border issue.In recent months, India and China have taken a series of steps to normalise relations after ending the more than four-year military face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.These include resumption of direct flights in October, agreement to restart the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, commemoration of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and visa facilitation. India also resumed granting tourist visas to Chinese nationals in July, reversing a suspension imposed after the 2020 standoff.Earlier this month, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met Sun Haiyan, vice minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China, to review the positive momentum in bilateral relations.The ministry of external affairs said that the discussions focused on advancing ties through enhanced people-to-people exchanges while addressing sensitive issues. Separately, a Chinese Communist Party delegation also held courtesy meetings with leaders of the RSS and the BJP as part of routine exchanges, news agency ANI reported.","Chinese President Xi Jinping extended greetings to President Droupadi Murmu on the occasion of India’s 77th Republic Day.

Political reaction beyond Kamala Harris

‘This Is America?’ Kamala Harris Reacts to Viral Video of Nurse Killed by Federal Officers

Framing the incident: Kamala Harris and public sentiment

Use of force and civilian casualties during federal operations.

Transparency concerns, with state officials reportedly denied access to investigate the scene.

Messaging disputes between official agency accounts and independent video evidence suggesting different sequences of events.

What’s next





In a forceful social media outburst that quickly gained national attention, Kamala Harris , former US vice president and senior Democratic political figure, took to X (formerly Twitter ) to condemn the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse shot dead by federal law enforcement officers in Minneapolis on January 24, 2026. Harris’s tweet crystallised widespread political and public outrage over the incident and intensified debate over federal law enforcement practices in US cities.Harris tweeted, “Alex Jeffrey Pretti was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. His life, through his profession, was dedicated to serving his community and our country. As so many have now seen on video, his final act before he was killed by federal agents was doing everything in his power to protect his community.”She went on to write, “Alex and tens of thousands of Minnesotans have boldly defended their neighbours against the murderous occupation of an American city by the federal government.” The message concluded with a forceful expression of personal and national grief: “I am enraged and heartbroken for Alex, his family, Minneapolis, and America.”The tweet came amid chaos in Minneapolis after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, who worked at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, during an operation that law enforcement described as immigration enforcement.Local and national reporting shows that federal agencies said Pretti approached officers with a handgun during the encounter, prompting a Border Patrol agent to fire.However, independent footage and eyewitness accounts have raised serious questions about that account. Videos shared widely on social media show Pretti holding a phone and attempting to assist a woman who had been pushed by an agent before he was pepper-sprayed, wrestled to the ground and then shot multiple times, raising confusion about what actually transpired in the moments before the fatal shot.Harris’s statement is significant not just for its emotional weight but for how it frames the narrative of the incident. It humanises Pretti, emphasising his professional life as a caregiver and his dedication to community service, a stark contrast to official statements painting the episode as a violent confrontation.It taps into broader political discontent with federal enforcement approaches under the current US administration, particularly regarding immigration operations in cities such as Minneapolis. It amplifies public criticism, encouraging more scrutiny from media, activists and lawmakers who have already criticised federal tactics as overly aggressive or lacking transparency.The bluntness of Harris’s language, including phrases like “murderous occupation of an American city by the federal government”, highlights how polarised the political reaction has become. Critics of federal enforcement see the shooting as part of a pattern of excessive force against civilians, while supporters of the agents’ actions argue they were acting to protect themselves and enforce law.Harris’s remarks align with similar condemnations from Democratic officials across the US Following the shooting, lawmakers such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and national Democrats called for accountability and even structural changes to immigration enforcement practices. Some demanded congressional action to defund or restrict Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol operations amid public protests.The incident also prompted organised protests in Minneapolis, where demonstrators clashed with law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard was activated to maintain order, a sign of how volatile the situation became in the immediate aftermath of Pretti’s death.Harris’s tweet serves not only as a political denunciation but also as a lens through which many Americans view the Pretti shooting, not just as a law-enforcement encounter but as a broader symptom of systemic governance issues. Many critics see federal enforcement actions in Minneapolis as emblematic of deeper problems:This narrative conflict, official justification vs public video and political critique, has made the incident a flashpoint in national discussions on law enforcement, civil liberties and executive authority. The dialogue sparked by Harris’s tweet has implications beyond Minneapolis. It feeds into larger national conversations about how US cities interact with federal law enforcement, especially when it comes to controversial policies like aggressive immigration enforcementSupporters of stronger immigration control argue federal agents are necessary to enforce law, while opponents see these actions as overreach that jeopardises community safety and civil rights. The polarised reactions highlight how a single high-profile incident can galvanise national political discourse, shaping narratives about government power, accountability and community protection.Through her tweet, Kamala Harris has ensured that Alex Pretti’s death remains not only a local tragedy but a symbol in national political debate, raising questions about citizen safety, federal power and how Americans expect government agents to interact with the people they are meant to protect.Several developments are unfolding. Investigations and legal scrutiny, Minnesota officials have pursued legal action to prevent federal authorities from destroying evidence related to the incident. Public protests and civic responses, Minneapolis has seen sustained public demonstrations calling for transparency and justice. Political mobilisation, Democrats and civil liberties advocates continue to use the case to argue for policy changes in federal law enforcement practices.","Kamala Harris condemned the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse shot dead by federal law enforcement officers in Minneapolis on January 24, 2026.

At least 11 people were killed and 12 others injured after gunmen opened fire at a soccer field in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato on Sunday, local authorities said.The attack took place in a neighbourhood in the town of Salamanca, prompting security forces to launch a search operation for those responsible, according to a statement from the mayor’s office, reported AFP.“The deaths of 11 people have been confirmed, 10 of whom died at the scene and one more while receiving medical attention at a hospital,” the statement said. “Additionally, 12 people were injured by gunfire and are receiving medical attention,” it added.Authorities said that four bags containing human remains were also discovered in Salamanca late Saturday night, hours before the shooting.Guanajuato, a major industrial hub that is home to several popular tourist destinations, remains Mexico’s deadliest state due to ongoing turf wars between criminal groups, according to official homicide data.Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum said earlier this year that the country’s homicide rate in 2025 had fallen to its lowest level in a decade, attributing the decline to her administration’s national security strategy.","Gunmen opened fire at a soccer field in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato on Sunday, local authorities said.

INDORE : A 75-year-old retired teacher who led protests against filthy drinking water in Indore’s Bhagiratrhpura died on Sunday, the third such death in four days coinciding with an apparent mismatch between official casualty counts of the tragedy in the past month and govt compensation cheques.While Rajaram Bourasi’s family and residents attributed his death to contaminated water, officials cited “co-morbidities” such as high blood pressure and diabetes as the cause. His death fuelled fresh panic and a fierce political row in BJP-governed MP, with opposition Congress accusing the govt of “poisoning citizens”. “The negligence, corruption, and arrogance of the BJP govt claimed the lives of 28 innocent people by serving them poisonous water. @drmohanyadav51 (Dr Mohan Yadav), what was the crime of these 28 people that your govt gave them poison in their water?” state Congress president Jitu Patwari wrote on X, referring to chief minister Mohan Yadav.",Rajaram Bourasi’s family and residents attributed his death to contaminated water.

NEW DELHI: Celebrations marking the 77th Republic Day at Kartavya Path on Monday will centre on the theme of the 150th anniversary of the national song Vande Mataram , a timeless mantra that awakened the spirit of Swadeshi, self-reliance and freedom in India’s national consciousness. This year, Kartavya Path, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, has been elaborately decorated for the occasion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a year-long commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the national song, culminating on November 7, 2025, according to news agency ANI.According to a release from the Ministry of Defence, the celebrations will present an extraordinary blend of the 150-year legacy of Vande Mataram, the country’s unprecedented developmental progress, robust military strength, vibrant cultural diversity and active participation from citizens across all walks of life.A distinguished series of paintings created by Tejendra Kumar Mitra in 1923, illustrating the verses of Vande Mataram and published in the Bande Mataram Album (1923), is being displayed as view-cutters along Kartavya Path.As many as 30 tableaux—17 from States and Union Territories and 13 from Ministries, Departments and Services—will roll down Kartavya Path under the broad themes of ‘Swatantrata ka Mantra: Vande Mataram’ and ‘Samriddhi ka Mantra: Aatmanirbhar Bharat’.The tableaux will showcase a unique blend of the 150-year journey of the national song and the nation’s rapid progress driven by growing self-reliance across sectors, infused with rich and vibrant cultural diversity.Adopted as India’s National Song by the Constituent Assembly in 1950, Vande Mataram was initially composed independently and later included in Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s novel Anandamath, published in 1882. It was first sung by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 Congress session in Calcutta and was set to music by him.Vande Mataram, which translates to “Mother, I Bow to Thee,” has inspired generations of freedom fighters and nation builders and remains a lasting emblem of India’s national identity and collective spirit. It has become an integral part of the nation’s civilisational, political and cultural consciousness.Popularised during the Swadeshi and anti-partition movements, the song soon transcended regional boundaries to emerge as an anthem of national awakening. From Bengal to Bombay and the plains of Punjab, its refrain echoed as a symbol of resistance against colonial rule. British efforts to suppress its rendition only heightened its patriotic significance, transforming it into a moral force that united people across caste, creed and language. Leaders, students and revolutionaries drew strength from its verses, reciting it at political gatherings, demonstrations and even before imprisonment.“Vande Mataram” emerged as the rallying cry of Indian nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the turbulent days of 1905, amid the anti-partition and Swadeshi movement in Bengal, the appeal of the song and slogan became especially powerful. At the Varanasi session of the Indian National Congress that year, Vande Mataram was adopted for all-India occasions.Parliament marked 150 years of the national song in December 2025 with special discussions in both Houses, initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The debates traced the song’s history and included references to the 1937 Congress decision to adopt only its first two stanzas. The government has also launched initiatives nationwide to connect the youth with the song’s original spirit.At the conclusion of the Republic Day parade, a banner bearing ‘Vandemataram’ will be unveiled, accompanied by the release of rubber balloons, marking a fitting tribute to the enduring spirit of the nation.","Kartavya Path, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, has been elaborately decorated for the occasion.

JHANSI: A 13-year-old boy, who had been kidnapped, was found dead in Uttar Pradesh’s Chitrakoot district Friday, his body stuffed inside a suitcase. Police shot his two kidnappers when they allegedly tried to escape during the recovery of the crime weapon; one of them died on the way to hospital.Ayush Kesarwani, a Class 7 student and resident of Bangar area, went missing Thursday evening. Around 8.30pm, his father Ashok, a cloth merchant, received a call from an unknown number demanding Rs 40 lakh ransom.Police said the accused, Irfan (28) and Kallu (22), had called Ashok using a cellphone stolen from a relative. Both were natives of Prayagraj who had relocated a year ago; they ran a shop making tin boxes and trunks.They had been Ashok’s tenants until he kicked them out in Sept last year for alleged shady behaviour. Apparently nursing agrudge, the duo moved into a nearby house and lured Ayush to their accommodation.A distraught Ashok alerted cops, and police personnel from around 10 police stations, along with SOG and SWAT teams, carried out a frantic search. Technical surveillance teams traced the cellphone used to make the ransom call and zeroed in on the accused before they could switch the device off, destroy evidence, or flee.After an overnight search, the kidnappers were caught early Friday. They confessed to having murdered Ayush, stuffing his body in a suitcase and burying it near his residence.“The accused were taken to a nearby jungle where the stolen cellphone was recovered. They constantly tried to mislead us about the body’s location. In between, they snatched the gun from police and opened fire. In retaliatory firing, both were injured. When they were taken to the hospital, Kallu was declared dead, while Irfan was referred to a higher centre in Prayagraj,” Chitrakoot SP Arun Kumar Singh said.Kallu had a murder case and two other cases registered in the past in Prayagraj Commissionerate.The crime sparked protests in the area, with thousands of angry residents staging a dharna, blocking the national highway for hours and raising slogans demanding harsh punishment for the accused, including ‘bulldozer justice’. The protesters demanded compensation and a govt job for the kin of the deceased, along with an assurance that they would not be booked for blocking the NH.Senior police and administrative officials reached the spot and appealed to the agitators to vacate the area, assuring them of proper action.","Ayush Kesarwani, a Class 7 student and resident of Bangar area, went missing Thursday evening.

Periodic table meets Shakespeare: Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) appoints chemistry professor as HOD of English,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/periodic-table-meets-shakespeare-univ-appoints-chemistry-prof-hod-of-eng/articleshow/127322089.cms,"File Photo Used For Representative Purpose Only







AHMEDABAD: The decision of Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) to appoint a chemistry professor as the in-charge head of its English department ended up in combustion triggering multiple litigations and a fuming court questioning the university--how a science teacher would address academic concerns of English literature students?The HNGU was forced to reverse the decision even as the court allowed aggrieved party to knock on appropriate doors for further justice.The issue arose after the retirement of former HOD of English, Adesh Pal, in June last year, when the university appointed Kokilaben Parmar, a faculty member in the chemistry department, as in-charge HOD of English. The appointment was challenged by Hetal Patel, a faculty member in the English department, who approached the Education Tribunal.HNGU's advocate, Meet Shah, defended the university's decision, submitting that the seniority of faculty members in the English department was yet to be ascertained. He said Parmar was tasked to look after only administrative affairs of the department. He also questioned Patel's application in the tribunal, arguing it was not a service matter but only the university's administrative decision for a temporary arrangement.On Oct 10, 2025, the tribunal stayed HNGU's decision to appoint a chemistry faculty member as English HOD. Parmar then approached the high court, challenging the stay on the grounds that she was not heard by the tribunal before it stayed her appointment as HOD of English.A week later, the high court stayed the tribunal's order.The university also challenged the tribunal's decision, citing the tribunal's jurisdiction to entertain Patel's application, which it said was not a service matter. Patel's counsel submitted that the university ignored the rules and neglected her in appointing the chemistry faculty member as in-charge HOD.During a hearing on Tuesday, Justice Nirzar Desai questioned the university on how chemistry could address academic concerns of a student of English literature. The university could not reply to the court's query, but said Parmar's role was restricted to administrative decisions only. However, the court continued to question how an HOD not well versed in the subject could help a student.On Friday, the university produced a draft order to replace the chemistry teacher with a faculty member of the English department, Tapal Chakrabarty. The university clarified that it could not replace Parmar as in-charge HOD with somebody else due to the high court's stay order. Patel objected to the proposal as well, citing the rules of appointment and seniority.Following HNGU's new decision, Parmar and the university withdrew their petitions. On Patel's grievance regarding Chakrabarty as the new choice, the High Court said, ""…it shall be open for respondent No. 3, Ms. Patel, to challenge the same before the appropriate authority in accordance with law.""","Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) appointed a chemistry professor as the in-charge head of its English department. The appointment was challenged by Hetal Patel, a faculty member in the English department, who approached the Education Tribunal. The tribunal stayed HNGU's decision to appoint a chemistry faculty member as English HOD. Parmar then approached the high court, challenging the stay on the grounds that she was not heard by the tribunal before it stayed her appointment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127368766,imgsize-73170,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

MUMBAI: Nearly a week after two bullets were fired at two separate flats of an Andheri-based housing society, Oshiwara Police arrested actor Kamaal R Khan in the case on Saturday. Police recovered a German-made pistol and 21 rounds from the actor's bungalow in Versova.The motive is still being probed-- police said Khan was checking the pistol believing that one round was left behind in it. However, Khan's lawyer, Nagesh Mishra, told mediapersons that the actor has not made any admission before the police.The bullets were found inside the apartments of writer Neeraj Mishra and model Prateek Baid on the second and fourth floor of Nalanda society in Lokhandwala on Jan 18. Impact marks were found on a plywood cabinet and walls. Nobody was injured.After the police were informed, they studied CCTV footage but nobody was found entering or leaving the society. The guard said he hadn't sounds of gunfire. Police then took the help of forensic experts to find out what type of firearm did the bullets belong to. They then found out the firing range of such a weapon and checked which of the residents from the area had registered similar weapons.The police team, supervised by additional commissioner Paramjeet Dahiya and DCP Dikshitkumar Gedam, and comprising senior inspector Sanjay Chavan and inspector Sachin Patil took Khan into custody after confirming that the bullets came from his 7.65 mm Mauser. Police said Khan has a prior crime record.Around 1 pm on Saturday, Khan was produced before a magistrate court at Bandra and remanded to police custody till Jan 27. Adv Mishra argued that Khan had no intention for firing. ""The actor is not acquainted with either of the people (in whose houses the bullets were found). He has a licensed pistol that he has kept at home for self-defence,"" Adv Mishra said. The lawyer added that the range of a pistol is 20 metres but the bullets were found 400 metres away.Between Khan's bungalow and Nalanda society, there are mangroves, roads and an under-construction structure.Adv Mishra has also claimed that the actor was not served a notice, as required under Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, nor were the grounds of arrest disclosed to him.",Police recovered a German-made pistol and 21 rounds from the actor's bungalow in Versova.

'Deeply insulting to two million Hindus': North American body calls out Kanye West for calling Swastika 'destructive symbol',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deeply-insulting-to-two-million-hindus-north-american-body-calls-out-kanye-west-for-calling-swastika-destructive-symbol/articleshow/127595259.cms,"Kanye West apologises for antisemitic remarks, reveals ""psychotic, impulsive behaviour"" after bipolar diagnosis

Outrage Erupts As Kanye West’s Hitler-Praising Song Plays During Miami Influencer Party | WATCH.

Why there is so much misinformation around the swastika





A North American Hindu advocacy group has criticised US rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, for equating the swastika with Nazi symbolism, calling the remark “deeply insulting” and historically inaccurate.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) said Ye’s statement had offended nearly two billion people worldwide for whom the swastika is a sacred religious symbol. The organisation said such conflations reinforce long-standing misconceptions about Hindu, Buddhist and Jain traditions.The controversy follows Ye’s apology for earlier antisemitic remarks, in which he said he had “gravitated towards the most destructive symbol” he could find, referring to the swastika. CoHNA said this framing ignores historical fact, noting that Adolf Hitler did not describe the Nazi emblem as a swastika, but as the Hakenkreuz, or “hooked cross”.“For thousands of years, the swastika has symbolised auspiciousness, good fortune and well-being in Dharmic traditions,” CoHNA president Nikunj Trivedi said. “Equating it with a symbol of hate is deeply offensive and undermines the religious freedom of millions who use this sacred symbol in their daily lives.”The group also called on The Wall Street Journal, where Ye’s remarks appeared in a paid advertisement, to issue a correction clarifying the distinction between the Nazi symbol and the swastika used in Eastern religions. CoHNA pointed out that this distinction has been formally recognised by lawmakers in parts of the US and Canada.Ye’s latest remarks come amid a prolonged period of erratic and controversial public behaviour that has seen the artist repeatedly embroiled in outrage. Over the past few years, he has drawn global condemnation for antisemitic statements, praise for extremist figures, and the use of Nazi imagery in music, fashion and public appearances. Major brands and business partners have cut ties with him, while his public statements have often been followed by clarifications or apologies citing mental health struggles, including bipolar disorder.For Hindu and other Dharmic communities, the issue goes beyond Ye himself. The swastika has long been a focal point of global efforts to reclaim and contextualise the symbol as one of peace, prosperity and spiritual meaning, distinct from its 20th-century appropriation by Nazi Germany. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain groups across countries have campaigned for public awareness, educational reform and legal clarity to prevent the sacred symbol from being automatically associated with hate ideologies.These efforts, community leaders say, are about protecting religious freedom and cultural heritage, not minimising the atrocities committed under Nazi symbolism. “Both historical truth and moral clarity are possible,” CoHNA has argued, stressing that acknowledging the horrors of Nazism should not come at the cost of stigmatising ancient religious traditions.This is not the first time Ye has faced criticism from Hindu groups. In 2025, CoHNA objected to the sale of merchandise bearing Nazi imagery, again warning against the mislabelling of the Hakenkreuz as a swastika.The confusion between the swastika and Nazi symbolism has deep historical roots. In the early 20th century, English-language media began translating Hakenkreuz as “swastika” while reporting on the rise of Nazi Germany. What began as a linguistic shortcut hardened into convention, especially during and after World War II.Over time, the Western understanding of the word “swastika” became almost entirely defined by Nazism, erasing its thousands-of-years-old religious and cultural history. In Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, the swastika predates Nazism by millennia and continues to symbolise good fortune, continuity and the cyclical nature of life.In recent years, Hindu and interfaith groups have intensified efforts to reclaim the symbol’s original meaning through public education, academic engagement and legal clarification. Several legislatures in North America have formally recognised the distinction between the Nazi Hakenkreuz and the religious swastika, reflecting growing awareness that precision matters when dealing with symbols tied to both genocide and living faiths.","The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) said Ye’s statement had offended nearly two billion people worldwide for whom the swastika is a sacred religious symbol.

HYDERABAD: A group of gig workers allegedly attacked the security guards of a prominent gated community at Moosapet in Kukatpally for stopping one of them as part of security protocol.The incident of the guards being brutally beaten up by the group of delivery boys was caught on CCTV cameras. According to the Kukatpally police, one of the guards had stopped Wasim, a delivery boy, at the gate as part of security protocol. This led to an argument between the two. Later, the guard allowed him to deliver the parcel, after which Wasim left the premises. A few hours later, he returned with a group of other gig workers, and attacked the security guards.The group thrashed the guards ruthlessly, despite onlookers trying to intervene and diffuse the situation. One of the guards, who suffered bleeding injuries, was shifted to hospital.Based on a complaint by the gated community's security manager, the Kukatpally police registered a criminal case against Wasim and others, and are yet to arrest him.

AHMEDABAD: One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025, a stark measure of how the American dream continues to pull immigrants through illegal and increasingly dangerous routes despite an aggressive crackdown by Trump govt.US Customs and Border Protection caught 23,830 Indians between Jan and Dec 2025, far below the staggering 85,119 caught in 2024, yet still enough to keep India among the top source countries. Most of those caught were single adults chasing work and wages. Yet enforcement agencies flagged a darker trend: a small but troubling flow of unaccompanied children. Nearly four years after the Jan 2022 Dingucha tragedy, when four members of a family from Gandhinagar froze to death while crossing from Canada into the US, children continue to be found abandoned near borders. The 2025 figures underscore a central paradox: enforcement has reduced numbers, but not the urge to try. For thousands, the promise of America still outweighs walls, patrols and peril.US border officials link the drop to stepped-up surveillance, policy shifts under President Donald Trump and a sweeping enforcement drive by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Smuggling corridors have narrowed, patrols intensified and penalties sharpened.Still, attempts continue.""The data shows deterrence, not elimination,"" said experts tracking migration flows. They point to the enduring economic and social pull of the US, paired with smuggling networks that quickly rewire routes when pressure mounts.Indian agencies monitoring illegal immigration, particularly from Gujarat, echo that assessment. ""There is a massive decrease due to stricter US policies and a massive crackdown by agencies including ICE,"" said a senior officer. ""But the numbers are still there because the aspiration of settling in the US, especially among Gujaratis, continues.""Mexico remains a key pathway, but 2025 marked a visible shift north. More Indians were intercepted along the Canada-US border, reflecting how smugglers are abandoning heavily policed Latin American corridors for riskier alternatives.""Routes via Mexico and Canada through hubs like Dubai and Istanbul were the main illegal channels. These routes are now heavily hampered,"" the officer said. ""People who want to illegally enter the US are still trying through newer, riskier paths.""","One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025.

What Meta said





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has said that an individual has to be “braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure”. The Russian billionaire’s comments come amid a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp in San Francisco, accusing it of accessing users' messages, contradicting end-to-end encryption (E2EE) promises. “You’d have to be braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure in 2026. When we analyzed how WhatsApp implemented its “encryption”, we found multiple attack vectors,” Pavel Durov wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).In the post, Durov cited Telegram's internal analysis revealing unspecified ""attack vectors"" in WhatsApp's encryption implementation, though no public details have emerged, while WhatsApp's Signal Protocol has undergone independent audits confirming default E2EE.As reported by Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for Northern California. It challenges Meta’s marketing of E2EE feature, a security standard which the company claims protects the messages on the app and ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message.The lawsuit claims that Meta’s privacy claims are false as the company WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.The plaintiffs represented users from India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa. It also alleges that the company retains the ability to decrypt and review the substance of messages for data analysis and internal monitoring.Calling the allegations “frivolous” and “absurd,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs’ counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false. WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction,"" Stone said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has said that an individual has to be “braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure” The Russian billionaire’s comments come amid a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp in San Francisco, accusing it of accessing users' messages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127595568,imgsize-17840,width-400,resizemode-4/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-says-have-to-be-braindead-to-believe-whatsapp-is-secure.jpg"

The woman and her employer had gone for a late-night stroll along a narrow, winding road in the forested area around 3 am on Sunday. They were near their parked car when a youth approached them.



The man snatched the woman’s mobile phone and ran towards the hills, preventing her from calling for help.



When she tried to chase him, the accused allegedly overpowered her, dragged her into a Scorpio he was driving, and locked the doors, despite her colleague’s attempts to intervene.



Her employer immediately alerted the police and provided detailed information about the Scorpio, including its registration and description.



Bhati drove the woman through the forested area and the city, moving in random directions. However, the Scorpio got stuck in a pit in a village as its tyres sank into mud, giving the victim a brief chance to scream for help, prompting the accused to flee on foot.



Police teams tracked the SUV using the woman’s phone location, and the victim was rescued unharmed near the spot where the vehicle stalled.



The Scorpio’s registration details led authorities to the owner, who confirmed that Bhati had borrowed the car under the pretext of buying liquor.



Three separate police teams were mobilized to trace Bhati, and he was arrested within a few hours.



Investigations revealed that Bhati was intoxicated during the crime. During a crime scene recreation, he attempted to escape, fell in rugged terrain, and sustained a fractured right leg and facial injuries. He was hospitalised under custody before being produced in court.
