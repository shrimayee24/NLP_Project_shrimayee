TOI

A month prior to the arrest of two shooters for firing outside actor Salman Khan ’s house, another plan had been hatched by the Lawrence Bishnoi gang to eliminate Khan at his Panvel farmhouse , say Navi Mumbai police .has managed to access the details of the investigation. A copy of the FIR filed at Panvel police station in Navi Mumbai shows that the jailed gangster Bishnoi, his Canada-based cousin Anmol Bishnoi, and accomplice Goldy Brar had plotted to kill the actor by sourcing sophisticated weapons including an AK-47 , M-16 and AK-92 from a Pakistan-based weapon supplier. The objective was presumably to waylay his vehicle or storm the farmhouse, said police sources. It is not yet clear to investigators why a second plan was set into motion to fire at the actor’s Bandra residence.Navi Mumbai police last week arrested four persons linked to the earlier plot and are looking for at least 15-20 other members of the Bishnoi gang who stayed in the vicinity of Khan’s farmhouse since Feb this year. The gang has been targeting him over his involvement in the killing of a black buck in 1998 in Rajasthan during the making of a film.The arrested accused have been identified as Dhananjay Tapesingh alias Ajay Kashyap, Gaurav Bhatia alias Nahvi, Vaspi Khan alias Waseem Chikna and Rizwan Khan alias Javed Khan. The conspiracy came to light last month when senior inspector Nitin Thackeray received a tip-off that a few people were planning to carry out an attack on Khan’s farmhouse.“We got to know recently after the Bandra shooting that Bishnoi had sent a few men to Navi Mumbai, namely Ajay Kashyap and others who went by the nicknames of Rocky Shooter, Satish Kaur and Sukha Shooter,” said an officer.Bishnoi himself is an undertrial in Sabarmati jail in Gujarat. Police last week arrested four suspects who, in the course of investigations, said that Ajay Kashyap was communicating with a man identified only as Dogar, a contact based in Pakistan, through video conferencing.","Lawrence Bishnoi, his Canada-based cousin Anmol Bish noi, and accomplice Goldy Brar had plotted to kill the actor by sourcing sophisticated weapons.

OpenAI says stalled attempts by Israel-based company to interfere in Indian elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/openai-says-stalled-attempts-by-israel-based-company-to-interfere-in-indian-elections/articleshow/110604771.cms,"OpenAI , the creator of ChatGPT , has said it acted within 24 hours to disrupt deceptive uses of AI in covert operations focused on the Indian elections , leading to no significant audience increase.In a report on its website, OpenAI said STOIC, a political campaign management firm in Israel, generated some content on Indian elections alongside about the Gaza conflict.“In May, the network began generating comments that focused on India, criticised the ruling BJP party and praised the opposition Congress party,” it said. “In May, we disrupted some activity focused on the Indian elections less than 24 hours after it began.”OpenAI said it banned a cluster of accounts operated from Israel that were being used to generate and edit content for an influence operation that spanned X, Facebook, Instagram, websites and YouTube. “This operation targeted audiences in Canada, the United States and Israel with content in English and Hebrew. In early May, it began targeting audiences in India with English-language content.”It did not elaborate.Commenting on the report, minister of state for electronics & IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said, “It is absolutely clear and obvious that @BJP4India was and is the target of influence operations, misinformation and foreign interference, being done by and/or on behalf of some Indian political parties.”“This is a very dangerous threat to our democracy. It is clear vested interests in India and outside are clearly driving this and needs to be deeply scrutinised/investigated and exposed. My view at this point is that these platforms could have released this much earlier, and not so late when elections are ending,” he added.OpenAI said it is committed to developing safe and broadly beneficial AI. “Our investigations into suspected covert influence operations (IO) are part of a broader strategy to meet our goal of safe AI deployment.”It also said it is committed to enforcing policies that prevent abuse and to improving transparency around AI-generated content. That is especially true with respect to detecting and disrupting covert influence operations (IO), which attempt to manipulate public opinion or influence political outcomes without revealing the true identity or intentions of the actors behind them.“In the last three months, we have disrupted five covert IO that sought to use our models in support of deceptive activity across the internet. As of May 2024, these campaigns do not appear to have meaningfully increased their audience engagement or reach as a result of our services,” it said.“We nicknamed this operation Zero Zeno, for the founder of the stoic school of philosophy. The people behind Zero Zeno used our models to generate articles and comments that were then posted across multiple platforms…” it said.The content posted by these various operations focused on a wide range of issues, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza, the Lok Sabha elections, politics in Europe and the United States, and criticisms of the Chinese govt by dissidents and foreign governments.","ChatGPT creator OpenAI says it disrupted deceptive uses of AI in covert operations focused on the Indian elections.

""The most important factor is that there is proximity in filing those complaints and the date of murder of deceased Jaya Shetty. The last complaint is of April 14, 2001, and date of murder is May 4, 2001,"" special judge A M Patil said.On Thursday, the judge found Rajan guilty of criminal conspiracy to commit murder under IPC and three counts under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) Act. The detailed judgment copy was made available on Friday.Shetty's two sons were among the 32 witnesses examined by special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat. ""They specifically deposed that their father used to run hotels... where the deceased was shot. They both deposed that the person namely Hemant Pujari belonging to the gang of Chhota Rajan used to call their manager for the extortion of the amount,"" the judge said.It was also observed that even though the prosecution produced true copies of letters and not the original, their contents corroborated the oral testimony of Shetty's son as to the threat. ""Mere lapses of the investigating officer can not throw away the important piece of evidence when the witness himself identified those letters, signatures thereon, contents of the letters and endorsement of the police as to receipt of those letters,"" the judge said.The judge relied on the confession statements of previously convicted accused too. The judge, though, said transcripts of alleged extortion conversations between Shetty's son and absconding accused Hemant Pujari and deposition of Santosh Shetty, an alleged gangster deported from Bangkok, were weak pieces of evidence. Santosh was cleared in some of the cases.Shetty was shot dead at his Gamdevi restaurant by Rajan's henchmen.

Corrupt officials and harassed citizens are now a part of every-day life,"" he said in his letter to the MHRC chairman.""Since we have ignored this, the corruption is now pervasive, unsparing and institutionalized. It is not just one official who is evil; the entire officialdom is so. When this union of officials happens and departments combine they become impregnable.

Upside-down flags become symbol for Republicans protesting Trump's verdict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/upside-down-flags-become-symbol-for-republicans-protesting-trumps-verdict/articleshow/110607500.cms,"A Trump supporter in Florida after the guilty verdict was announced (Reuters photo)

After a New York jury returned a historic guilty verdict against former prez Donald Trump on Thursday, many Americans chose to rally around the flag. The upside-down flag. Social media overflowed on Thursday with images of Old Glory hung with the stars on the bottom, posted by elected Republicans , right-wing activists and regular Americans upset by the news that a former prez was now a felon.

The upside-down flag traditionally indicates distress and, on occasion, has been used as a sign of protest. But after NYT revealed two weeks ago that an inverted flag flew outside Justice Samuel Alito Jr.'s home in the weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the symbol has gained traction on the right - and Thursday's verdict seemingly pushed it into the centre of the conservative mainstream. Just six minutes after the jury in Manhattan found the former prez guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene posted an image of the upside-down flag on social media. The post had been viewed over 1.8 million times in a matter of hours.

That same picture was soon posted on Telegram by Ali Alexander, one of the key organisers of the campaign to convince voters that the 2020 polls had been rigged, along with the caption ""No one is coming to save us."" Guy Benson, a Fox News contributor, posted one too. The response was not limited to public figures, and many lower-profile Americans were posting photos of actual flipped flags suspended from poles outside their homes. The accompanying text generally pointed to the flag serving as an act of protest against the verdict, the US justice system, Biden and the so-called Deep State.

MOSCOW: The Kremlin said on Friday that it was already aware of attempts by Ukraine to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons provided by the United States.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was commenting after four US officials told Reuters on Thursday that US President Joe Biden had quietly authorised Kyiv to launch US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

""No, nothing is known to us about this particular decision,"" Peskov told a news briefing when asked about it.

""What we know is that generally, there are already attempts to strike Russian territory with weapons produced by the United States. This is enough for us and it speaks volumes about the degree to which the United States is involved in the conflict.""

Peskov did not elaborate on his assertion about such strikes or reference evidence detailing them.

He said a pro-war mood was also being whipped up in Europe to the point of ""pre-war hysteria"".

Detectives interviewed Ali on Wednesday night.Ali faces more than a dozen charges, including attempted murder , attempted assault, and hate crimes charges. Police do not believe the attack is terror-related and have not found evidence linking him to radical groups online.The attack began as Ali, driving a 2011 white Crown Victoria, turned onto East 55th Street in front of the Mesivta Nachlas Yakov School and suddenly veered toward students in Orthodox attire. He then circled the block and returned, targeting two more students and a rabbi.“I’m gonna kill all the Jews,” Ali allegedly shouted, according to police. The victims managed to run into the building before being struck. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Authorities have listed five victims in the case: three 18-year-olds, a 41-year-old man, and a 44-year-old man.Rabbi Twersky, who works at the Yeshiva, described the chaos as the driver attempted to strike one of the boys at the corner of Glenwood Road and East 55th Street. Ali then drove up the wrong side of East 56th Street and barreled toward a group of 30 to 40 students.“I’m much more scared than they are — their adrenaline is up,” Twersky said.Tire marks on the sidewalk near the Yeshiva remained visible Wednesday night, with a police car stationed outside. Ali initially got away but was quickly located by the Shomrim Safety Patrol, who swarmed the area and found the attacker at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, the NY Post report said.“We were able to retrieve the video footage. We got the guy’s plate number,” said Bob Moskowitz, executive coordinator of the patrol. “Obviously it was a very distinct car, a Crown Vic, an old model. You don’t see too many of those around.”Ali, who has lived in the US for over two decades, was taken into custody and transferred to Coney Island Hospital. He is considered an “emotionally disturbed” person with a prior arrest in 1998 for false personation. He has four prior arrests, including one for criminal impersonation, though details of the other arrests were not immediately clear.“We were very pleased to be able to apprehend this individual,” Moskowitz stated. “This is not somebody that we want driving around the streets, especially with this anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish climate that’s out there. So we were glad to be able to put this to rest. The community was kind of uptight about this. Now everybody can be a little more relaxed.”","Asghar Ali, 58, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz calls some judges 'black sheep'; accuses them of giving relief to Imran Khan



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from former US president Donald Trump , former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that the February national election was rigged , calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate.""Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is being held in solitary confinement, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations and were being ""victimised.""Despite Khan's party winning the most seats in the February election, they fell short of a majority, allowing his opponent Shehbaz Sharif to form a government with the support of allied parties. The top court granted Khan permission to appear and plead petitions he had filed against amendments to the country's anti-graft laws.The Pakistan Muslim League (N) secured 75 seats, the Pakistan People's Party came third with 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has agreed to support them with 17 seats.Imran Khan's defense was similar to that of former US President Donald Trump who on several occasions has also claimed that the 2020 US elections were 'rigged' and 'stolen' by the democrats.Earlier today, a Pakistan court acquitted Imran Khan in two cases related to violence that occurred on May 9. The court cited a lack of sufficient evidence against the 71-year-old founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The verdict was delivered by judicial magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad, who approved the petition challenging the two cases filed at Shehzad Town police station.The court stated in its verdict: ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Last year, following Khan's arrest in an alleged corruption case, his supporters engaged in vandalism targeting public property, including sensitive army installations. This is not the first time Khan has been acquitted in cases connected to the May 9 violence; on May 15, he was also cleared in two other related cases.Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday had accused some serving judges, whom he referred to as ""black sheep,"" of allegedly providing relief to Imran Khan in various cases.""Some black sheep in (the) judiciary are there to save Imran Niazi from 190 billion pounds and other cases. Every day, it is planned how to give him bail in certain cases,"" he said.Shehbaz made these allegations during a general council meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), where his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president.","Imran Khan claims that the February national election was rigged, calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate"" Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations.

White House officials insisted, however, that the authorisation extended only to what they characterised as acts of self-defence, so that Ukraine could protect Kharkiv , its second-largest city, and the surrounding areas from missiles, glide bombs and artillery shells from just over the border.""The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,"" a US official said in a statement issued by the administration. ""Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,"" the statement continued, referring to an artillery system, provided to Ukraine, that has the capability to reach deep inside Russian territory.The decision by Biden was reported earlier Thursday by Politico. American officials said that the change in policy went into effect Thursday.Though the White House cast the decision as a narrow one, the implications are clearly much broader. Until now, Biden has flatly refused to let Ukraine use American-made weapons outside of Ukrainian borders, no matter what the provocation, saying that any attack on Russian territory risked violating his mandate to ""avoid World War III"". But having reversed his position, even in limited circumstances, Biden has clearly crossed a red line that he himself drew. And administration officials conceded that if Russia mounted other attacks from inside its territory beyond Kharkiv, the president's restrictions could be subject to further loosening. ""This is a new reality,"" one senior official said, declining to speak on the record, ""and perhaps a new era"" in the Ukraine conflict.Ukraine President Zelenskyy hailed the US decision Friday, calling it ""a step forward toward (the) goal ... of making it possible to defend our people...""","Biden's decision appears to mark the first time that an American president has allowed limited military responses on artillery, missile bases and command centres inside the borders of a nuclear-armed adversary.

NEW YORK: History happened just as everyone was about to leave for the day. Judge Juan M. Merchan had already summoned Donald Trump , his legal team and prosecutors into the courtroom where the former prez has been on trial since mid-April. The judge said he planned to send the jury home in a few minutes - at 4.30pm (local time) - with deliberations to resume the next morning.

Trump looked upbeat, having animated chats with his lawyers. Then, unexpectedly, the judge was back on the bench. There was a note from the jury, signed at 4.20pm. Merchan read it aloud. ""We the jury have reached a verdict,"" it said, and asked for an extra 30 minutes.

As the minutes ticked by, defence lawyer Todd Blanche whispered to Trump , who was stone-faced, arms crossed across his chest. The courtroom was packed with people, among them reporters, members of the public and Trump's son Eric.

Just before 5pm, the judge returned to the bench. Then, the moment came. The courtroom was silent. ""How say you to the first count of the indictment, charging Donald J. Trump with falsifying business records in the first degree?"" a court staffer asked. ""Guilty,"" the foreperson said. The same answer, ""guilty"", came again and again. The recitation took less than two minutes. Trump, convicted of all 34 felony counts , was seen sitting with an expressionless stare. He stood as jurors filtered out of the courtroom, appearing to be looking at them one by one as they passed in front of him. As the ex-president walked out, Eric put a hand on his back. Then, Trump turned to the cameras awaiting him in the hallway and said, ""I'm a very innocent man"". ""We'll fight to the end, and we'll win.""

In the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate the terms of a permanent end to hostilities. ""The ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue,"" the president said.

The third phase would involve a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden on Friday said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, and urged Hamas to accept the new offer, stating that it was the most effective way to end the ongoing conflict.""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is facing pressure during an election year to bring the eight-month-long Gaza conflict to a close.Despite mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar, and others, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with both sides accusing each other of hindering progress. Neither the Israeli prime minister's office nor Hamas immediately responded to Biden's comments.The new proposal outlined by Biden on Friday consists of three phases.According to Biden, the proposal has been relayed to Hamas by Qatar.The president appealed to those in Israel who are advocating for an ""indefinite"" war ""indefinite"" to change their minds.""I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition. They've made it clear. They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" Biden said.""As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost. We can't lose this moment,"" he added.Several Israeli media outlets described Biden's speech as dramatic and interpreted it as an attempt to directly appeal to the Israeli public. Channel 12, a leading news channel, interrupted its evening news show to broadcast Biden's speech live. According to anchor Danny Kushmaro, Israel's censor had previously prohibited the publication of the offer's details.An earlier hostage proposal put forward this year called for the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in Gaza in exchange for a six-week ceasefire that could be extended to allow for more aid to be delivered into the enclave. However, the proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Israel refused to agree to Hamas' demand for a permanent end to the war as part of the negotiations and intensified its assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.Hamas on Thursday said that it had informed mediators that it would not participate in further negotiations during ongoing aggression but was prepared for a ""complete agreement,"" including an exchange of hostages and prisoners, if Israel ended the war.According to a US official speaking on condition of anonymity, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet on Friday with diplomats from 17 countries whose citizens are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.A senior Israeli security official stated on Friday that Israel will not agree to any halt in fighting that is not part of a deal that includes the return of surviving hostages.The week has been dominated by the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.","US President Joe Biden said that Israel had proposed a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages.

The case, which has drawn significant public attention, centered around allegations of hush money payments made to Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, had previously claimed that Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 to keep silent about an alleged affair with Trump. The payments were reportedly made just before the 2016 election to prevent the story from influencing the vote.“I feel a sense of vindication,” Daniels said in response to the verdict. She has consistently maintained that the payment was intended to buy her silence about the affair, an allegation Trump has denied.The verdict found Trump liable for defamation and fraudulent business practices related to the payments. The court's decision marks a significant moment in the ongoing legal battles faced by the former president.Daniels added, “I hope that this will serve as a reminder that no one is above the law, and that the truth matters.”Michael Cohen, who has since turned against Trump and cooperated with investigators, also welcomed the verdict. “This is a significant step towards accountability,” Cohen remarked. He had pleaded guilty to several charges, including campaign finance violations, and testified that Trump directed him to make the payments.The ruling has been seen by many as a victory for those who have sought to hold Trump accountable for his actions both during and after his presidency. However, Trump and his legal team have vowed to appeal the decision, maintaining his innocence and calling the trial politically motivated.As the legal processes continue, the case remains a focal point in the broader discussion about legal accountability and the political implications of the verdict.

Targets included the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the ISI building in Faisalabad. For the first time, the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob.Despite these acquittals, Khan, who is held in the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, faces multiple allegations connected to the violence that erupted after his arrest.","Imran Khan was acquitted in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.

The US has also been conducting almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons prepared for launch.The US F/A-18 fighter jets were launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, with other US warships in the region also participating.The Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages.The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel, and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration. As a result, shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined due to the threat.President Joe Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the US will not tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping.
