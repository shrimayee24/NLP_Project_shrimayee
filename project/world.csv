NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday slammed Pakistan for its comments on the flag-hoisting event in Ayodhya, saying that instead of delivering hypocritical homilies, Pakistan would do better to turn its gaze inwards and focus on its own abysmal human rights record.Pakistan had earlier expressed deep concern over the event and called it a ""deliberate attempt to erode Muslim cultural and religious heritage under the influence of majoritarian Hindutva ideology"".""We have seen the reported remarks and reject them with the contempt they deserve,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.

Students claimed the university ignored repeated complaints about deteriorating hygiene and food quality.Many students said they had been forced to purchase bottled mineral water at their own expense for several days because of poor water quality in hostels.Tension reportedly rose when faculty members allegedly assaulted protesting students. As the agitation grew, large groups of students gathered in open areas of the campus around midnight, chanting slogans and demanding immediate action.According to sources, two cars, a bus, an ambulance and several motorbikes were set on fire, and furious students vandalised parts of the chancellor’s bungalow.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday wrote to Kolkata Police Commissioner Manoj Kumar Verma, raising alarm over a “serious security breach” during a protest by booth-level officers (BLOs) at the Chief Electoral Officer’s office in Kolkata.The poll body has directed the police to ensure the safety of its officials and submit an action-taken report within 48 hours.The letter was issued following a security breach on Monday during a protest by booth-level officers (BLOs) outside the Chief Electoral Officer’s office in Kolkata, where some demonstrators attempted to force entry, prompting police intervention and a brief scuffle.“It has come to the notice of ECI that on 24.11.2025 a serious security breach has occurred at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal, which has also been widely reported in Media,” the letter read.The poll body warned that the situation could endanger senior election officials.“The existing security in the office of the CEO appeared to be inadequate to handle the situation, which could lead to threat to the safety and security of the Chief Electoral Officer, Additional Chief Electoral Officers, Joint Chief Electoral Officers, Deputy Chief Electoral Officers and other officers and staff working in the office of the Chief Electoral Officer,” it said.The Commission has asked the police to ensure safety at the office, at residences of officials and during their travel.“The Commission has taken a serious view of the incident and directs that the Police Authorities should take all possible measures to ensure safety and security of officers and staff posted in the office of the CEO, at their residences and while commuting to and fro,” the letter stated.It further sought heightened security due to “sensitivity involved” ahead of upcoming elections in the state.“The Commission further directs that adequate security classification shall be done on account of sensitivity involved due to SIR activities and forthcoming elections in the State and ensure that no untoward incident occurs again. An action taken report may be sent to the Commission within 48 Hours of receipt of this letter,"" it further read.The breach occurred during a demonstration by booth-level officers outside the CEO’s office. Their protest march began around 1pm from College Street and reached the NSC Bose Road office at approximately 2.30pm.BLOs have alleged “inhumane stress” from the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Authorities had barricaded the entrance, but protesters tried to scale it, leading to a scuffle with police.At least 13 representatives were later allowed inside to submit a memorandum demanding an extension of deadlines and relief from online data-upload duties.Their agitation came days after the deaths of two BLOs, with families blaming excessive workload. Another officer suffered a cerebral attack, further fuelling anger among workers.West Bengal CEO Manoj Kumar Agarwal earlier said BLOs were “heroes” of the electoral process and assured that no action would be taken against them for genuine errors.The situation has intensified an already sharp confrontation between the state government and the ECI.On Monday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, flagging what she called two “disturbing yet urgent developments” ahead of polls.She criticised a centralised proposal by the CEO to outsource data entry staff:In her letter, Mamata wrote: “When district offices already have a substantial number of competent professionals performing such functions, what necessitates the CEO's initiative to outsource the same work through an external agency for a full year?”She also objected to a plan to set up polling stations inside private residential complexes, calling it “deeply problematic”.""It has further been brought to my attention that the Election Commission is considering setting up polling stations within private residential complexes, and DEOs have been asked to provide recommendations.This proposal is deeply problematic. Polling stations have always been-and must remain-located in government or semi-government institutions, preferably within a 2 km radius, to ensure accessibility and neutrality,"" Banerjee wrote in her letter.Banerjee appealed to the ECI to act “with utmost seriousness, impartiality and transparency.”The Special Intensive Revision exercise, which began on November 4, will conclude on December 4 and draft electoral rolls are scheduled for publication on December 9. Elections in West Bengal are scheduled next year.","The poll body has directed the police to ensure the safety of its officials and submit an action-taken report within 48 hours.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has once again landed in controversy -- this time over a photo he shared online wearing a T-shirt that appeared to mock the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The post quickly triggered outrage within the BJP , with the saffron party warning of police action.The row erupted after Kamra posted on his social media accounts a photo of himself in the respective T-shirt. He captioned the photo 'not clicked at a comedy show', hinting at the previous controversy that angered Shiv Sena , resulting in the destruction of the venue of his comedy show.Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the government would not ignore such posts. “The police would take action against anyone who puts out such objectionable posts,” he warned, responding to Kamra’s picture that showed a dog image alongside a reference to the RSS, the ideological parent of the BJP.Shiv Sena cabinet minister Sanjay Shirsat -- whose party is a BJP ally -- said the saffron party must respond strongly this time, recalling Kamra’s past potshots at both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde . “Earlier, he targeted Prime Minister Modi and Eknath Shinde, and now he has dared to directly attack the RSS. The BJP needs to respond to this,” Shirsat said.“We (Shiv Sena) responded to it (to Kamra's critical comments on Shinde earlier this year).Now, he has mustered the courage to make an objectionable post against the RSS,” he added.This is not Kamra’s first clash with political leaders. In March, he sparked a storm after mocking Shinde during a show by tweaking the lyrics of a popular Hindi film song. Angered by his remarks, Shiv Sena workers later vandalised the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai’s Khar -- the venue where Kamra had performed -- as well as the hotel building it is housed in.","Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has once again landed in controversy over a photo he shared online wearing a T-shirt that appeared to mock the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: Upping the ante in its political battle with TMC over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral roll in West Bengal, BJP on Wednesday urged the Election Commission to strengthen the ongoing process in the state as it flagged a host of concerns, including the presence of alleged infiltrators on voters' rolls, and demanded deportation or ""detention"" of those who are not Indians.A BJP delegation led by its state president Samik Bhattacharya presented its demands to EC ahead of the poll body's scheduled meeting with the state's governing TMC, which is stridently opposing SIR, on Friday.The BJP delegation told EC, ""The issue of illegal infiltration must be addressed systematically. Clear messaging must be issued regarding exfiltration or detention for individuals who are not Indian citizens."" Strengthened enforcement will help reduce fraudulent applications and ensure infiltrators do not remain on the electoral rolls, it added.BJP noted that illegal infiltration from Bangladesh has remained a longstanding concern in Bengal and they are believed to have obtained fraudulent documents through local networks. Many of them have admitted in live reporting that they have obtained such documents, it claimed.It also rejected the contention of opposition parties that workload is causing stress, even deaths by suicide, among booth-level officers (BLO), saying political coercion by the state's governing establishment for not deleting the names of ineligible voters is their primary problem.Names of a large number of deceased people continue to be on the electoral rolls, leaving scope for misuse, it claimed.","BJP demands deportation or ""detention"" of those who are not Indians.

'Islamophobia': Pak Meltdown Over Ayodhya Event Despite Its Own Poor Record of Minority Persecution

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: On Constitution Day, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, speaking at separate functions on Wednesday, called for upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution and uphold the rights of citizens. However, while Omar expressed concern that religious educational institutions were being unfairly targeted, Sinha asserted that the “practice of rewarding separatism” had stopped after provisions of the Constitution were made fully applicable to J&K in 2019.Addressing students and faculty at the 50th annual celebration of Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa in Jammu’s Poonch district, Omar said “propaganda and lies” were being spread against Muslim religious institutions in many parts of the country. This was unpatriotic, he added.As the programme began with the national anthem, patriotic songs and Constitutional Day pledges, the CM said, “I wish those people who spread venom against religious educational institutions through social media and the press had been here today to witness this programme. They claim that the institutions like Zia-ul-Uloom teach nothing except communalism, and only impart religious education.But you can see that along with religious studies, they teach science, mathematics and all other subjects. ”On social media, “lies are spread that these institutions promote anti-national sentiment”, where one could see here that the reality was completely different, he said.Omar said symbolic observation of Constitution Day meant nothing if its ideals were not followed. “Today, we observed Constitution Day. It does not mean we remember the Constitution just for one hour; it means we must uphold it every day. The Preamble guarantees equal rights for every religion, equal democratic rights and equality before law for all. But, we are passing through a phase where even education is being given a religious colour, where statements are made that a Muslim shouldn’t study in a medical college or that non-Hindus shouldn’t be admitted in a medical college,” the CM said.He was referring to objections raised by BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal over the admission of Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra. The row erupted after only eight Hindu students from Jammu made it to the first MBBS batch of 50. The admissions were based on the NEET merit list.Omar said Zia-ul-Uloom has always supported the govt and had always helped during natural disasters. During Operation Sindoor, shells fired from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir hit the madrassa on May 7, killing a teacher and wounding three students.LG Sinha, speaking at a function held in Jammu to celebrate 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution, said that after a long wait of 67 years, all provisions of the Constitution were fully implemented in J&K, ending discrimination and injustice. He was referring to the abrogation of Article 370, which granted a special status to J&K, in August 2019.“Those who say what was achieved over the past five years, I want to tell them that the practice of rewarding separatists and torturing patriots has been stopped completely,” the LG said. “Now, J&K is moving ahead guided by ideals of equity, social and economic justice as enshrined in the Constitution by Baba Saheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar.”",Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha spoke at separate functions on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday sent six persons, to three-day police custody after a protest against air pollution at the India Gate turned violent on Sunday.The police alleged that 10 police personnel were allegedly attacked with pepper spray during the protest over poor air quality. The police also told the court that they are probing naxal links as the protesters raised pro-naxal slogans.DCP (New Delhi) Devesh Mahla, appearing before Judicial Magistrate First Class Aridaman Singh Cheema of Patiala House Courts seeking seven days of police custody of the six accused said that Madvi Hidma (dead Maoist commander) killed 76 CRPF personnel and the accused were raising slogans for him""Some of the accused persons blocked Man Singh Road on November 9. There is an FIR in that regard as well. So, it won't be right to say this is the first time they're involved,"" said the police officer.Total 23 students were arrested and two FIRs were lodged.Meanwhile, alleging torture in police custody, the accused have moved bail applications, which will be heard after three days.The FIRs were lodged under charges related to assault, obstruction of public servants and outraging the modesty of women of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.The prosecution told the court that Radical Students Union (RSU) is a banned organisation which it was the frontal organisation and the accused have praised them on social media""Free speech is allowed but there are restrictions to free speech. We found three pepper sprays.

‘Will give medicine when required’

Siddaramaiah wants ‘swift decision’

‘No groups in the party’

Mallikarjun Kharge in CM race?

NEW DELHI: The standoff between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka seems to have entered its climax as Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday acknowledged the situation, saying that “medicine” will be given to resolve the issue.As soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculations after he claimed that there had indeed been a ""secret deal"" -- a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.On the ongoing political developments in the state, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing.But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.Karnataka minister Satish Jarkiholi said chief minister Siddaramaiah has asked the Congress high command to take an early call on the question of leadership change in the state.Jarkiholi, who handles the public works portfolio, told reporters that he plans to seek an appointment with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge to discuss the matter.He said the issue of succession must be settled by the party’s national leadership and revealed that Siddaramaiah too prefers a swift decision.“When the CM says it, then seniors in the party should take note of it,” he stated. However, he maintained that no internal discussions had taken place among MLAs on a possible leadership shift. “There is no discussion about leadership change in the party. Once it comes up then we will discuss, but there is no discussion about it in the party right now,” Jarkiholi said.A day after raising eyebrows with his remarks, DK Shivakumar on Wednesday changed tune, claiming that Congress is united and focused on the 2028 assembly and 2029 Lok Sabha elections.“Whatever is there, party issues, we will discuss within four walls. I will not discuss any political issues in the media,” the deputy chief minister said.He also denied any confusion or existence of factions within the party and said, “No one should demand anything. There are no groups in the party; there is only one group, that is the Congress. Our group has 140 MLAs.”Priyank Kharge passes Rahul’s message to Siddaramaiah, DKSAdditionally, Karnataka minister and Kharge’s son Priyank Kharge held discussions with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the leadership change issue in the state.According to reports, Priyank has conveyed Rahul’s message to both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, and they are likely to be called to New Delhi soon for a meeting aimed at resolving the matter.“Discussions are in the media. Will I meet Mohan Bhagwat (RSS chief) if not Rahul Gandhi? Will I report to Keshava Krupa (RSS state headquarters) without reporting to the CM and deputy CM on my meeting? Rahul Gandhi was invited for the Bengaluru Tech Summit; he couldn’t come. I had sought his time to show our Artificial Intelligence Personal Computer,” Kharge said in response to a question.Meanwhile, a section of Congress leaders also pitched Mallikarjun Kharge’s name for the chief minister post amid the “leadership tussle”.Minister Shivananda Patil had described Mallikarjun Kharge as the “most eligible person” for the CM post. “I had committed a mistake once by not voting for him. I accept it today,” he said.State home minister G Parameshwara also said that if the party high command decides, everyone would accept Kharge as the chief minister.The issue of a Dalit chief minister has long been debated within Congress, with senior Dalit leaders including Parameshwara and Mahadevappa speaking on the matter in the past.Some prominent Dalit leaders are reportedly planning to push for a “Dalit CM” before the high command in the event of a change in state leadership, PTI reported.News agency PTI cited sources and claimed that Kharge, a Dalit stalwart in the party, lost the chance to become chief minister thrice — in 1999 to S M Krishna, in 2004 to Dharam Singh, and in 2013 to Siddaramaiah.However, Kharge’s son Priyank dismissed the speculations, calling them “irrelevant”.“Whenever elections happen here (in Karnataka), he is in the race to become the CM, and whenever Parliamentary elections happen, he is in the race to become the PM. Such discussions are irrelevant now,” Priyank said.","Mallikarjun Kharge acknowledges that there is a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.

But what do they gain by voting for Congress?” Chandrasekhar said in Kozhikode, maintaining that the BJP has never discriminated against Muslims and has given representation whenever backed by voters.Chandrasekhar asserted that the party has included Muslim leaders within government and organisational structures. “There are Muslim MPs and leaders in the BJP, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain. Even today, there are Muslim MPs in the Rajya Sabha from J&K. In Kerala, there are many Muslim BJP candidates in local body elections. Former President APJ Abdul Kalam became President under the NDA. We have done our part. Before 2017, there wasn’t a single Cabinet Minister from Kerala either.

We will work hard to earn the trust of the Muslim community and end this poisonous campaign led by LDF and UDF...”“For the last 30 years, a false narrative has been created that we are communal and anti-Muslim. This is hypocrisy at its highest level. We openly state that we work for everyone,” he added, noting that a Muslim outreach team led by Prof Abdul Salam is in dialogue with community groups to address perception gaps.He further said the party respects all faiths but opposes organisations he claims work against constitutional values. “We are against Jamaat-e-Islami and SDPI because they act against the Constitution. We are also against those who support them, the LDF and Congress,” Chandrasekhar said.Opposition parties criticised the remarks, accusing the BJP of justifying under-representation rather than addressing it.Chandrasekhar maintained that minority outreach is a gradual process and said the party will continue engagement with Muslim communities ahead of future elections.","Kerala BJP president Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the absence of Muslim ministers in the Union cabinet reflects electoral mandate, not exclusion.

Former US Rep and economist Dr Dave Brat trained the guns at India over the H-1B visa program and said that while the national cap for H-1B is 85,000, one Indian district got 220,000 H-1B visas which is 2.5 times the limit. ""When you hear H-1B, think of your family, because these fraudulent visas just stole their future,"" Dr Brat said, appearing on Steve Bannon's podcast, adding that China contributes only 12% to the H-1B program.In 2024, India's Chennai consulate reportedly processed roughly 220,000 H-1B visas and 140,000 H-4 dependent visas.US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui , an Indian-origin US Foreign Service Officer, called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program as she recounted her experience at the Chennai consulate in India 20 years ago. Siddiqui revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.Siddiqui said she was posted to the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007 when she adjudicated at least 51,000 H-1B visas. The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate.Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure.

Here are the top developments

Toll rises to 44

Three arrested

Rescue ops ongoing

Witness account

Styrofoam fanned the flames





The death toll in the massive fire in multiple high rises in Hong Kong rose to 44, with over 270 hundred still missing. Later, several media outlets reported arrest of 3 people in connection to the fire.Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.State media reported that Xi called on authorities to “make every effort” to put out the fire and minimise further loss of life.“Xi Jinping expressed condolences for those who died in the major fire at a residential estate in Tai Po District, New Territories, Hong Kong, including the firefighter who died in the line of duty,” it said.The death toll in the incident was revised to 44, after initial count of 36, while 279 are reported missing.Police have arrested three men on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the blaze, as reported by South China Morning Post. Police announced the arrests in a brief, one-sentence advisory that did not detail the suspects’ alleged actions, and said more information would be provided at a later press conference.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee confirmed the rising toll and said that search teams were still tracing missing residents as smoke continued to billow from the charred towers.The Fire Services Department said it received the first emergency call at 2:51 pm local time and escalated the blaze to a No 4 alarm at 3:34 pm, one level below the highest emergency classification. Dozens of engines, ambulances and rescue teams were deployed as smoke poured from the towers, which house around 2,000 apartments and were undergoing renovation work.“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate the cause of the fire,” said John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, as quoted by AP.Witnesses described seeing residents gathered on overhead walkways as flames climbed rapidly up buildings covered in bamboo scaffolding. The Tai Po district, home to nearly 300,000 people, is among Hong Kong’s most tightly packed urban zones.Roads around the area remain closed, with bus routes diverted as firefighters continue sweeping each floor to locate survivors. More details are awaited as authorities verify the number of missing residents and assess structural safety before entering deeper sections of the complex.The blaze tore through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Tai Po on Wednesday, with flames and thick smoke engulfing the 32-storey blocks for more than ten hours.Fire Services Director Andy Yeung Yan-kin said officers found styrofoam inside the burning buildings, which he believes intensified the blaze. According to the South China Morning Post, the material allowed flames to race through corridors and ignite flats across multiple levels. Yeung noted that firefighters could only enter from the ground floor as many floors were still burning well into the early hours of Thursday. One of the biggest challenges, he said, was the number of levels alight simultaneously.Security Secretary Chris Tang called the fire’s speed “suspicious”. Preliminary checks, he said, showed that the building’s netting and waterproof tarpaulin burned far faster than regulated materials. “We found that the netting and waterproof tarpaulin on the building walls, once ignited, spread flames much faster than they should. This is unusual,” Tang said. He confirmed that police and fire officers would conduct a full investigation, including a criminal probe into any irregularities.Read more: What caused the Hong Kong fire that killed 36 and left hundreds missing","Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.

Candace Owens’ claims and the Macrons’ lawsuit





Candace Owens says her show will not come on air this week. She says she had to stop the show because she believes French President Emmanuel Macron tried to plan her murder. Candace Owens says she sent a report about this to the White House and to US counterterrorism teams. She also says these offices told her they got her report. These are her words, not confirmed by officials. She shared this update on X. She wrote that her show will be off the air and then said she wants people to know what is happening. Owens says someone close to the French first couple told her that Emmanuel Macron tried to organize the plan to kill her.Owens also says she thinks the Macrons were part of the plan to kill Charlie Kirk . Charlie Kirk was the founder of Turning Point USA. He was killed on September 10, 2025, while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. Owens says the Macrons did not act alone. She said that anyone who did not believe her can now wait for the President of the United States and US intelligence groups to make a statement. She says only then will people know if she is telling the truth.Candace Owens has also said before that Emmanuel Macron paid $1.5 million to hire someone to kill her. Again, these are her claims, and she has not shown public proof.Right now, Owens is dealing with a lawsuit from Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron . They filed this lawsuit because Owens kept saying Brigitte Macron is secretly a man.The lawsuit says Owens posted an eight-part series where she claimed Brigitte Macron was born male, took another woman’s identity, and later had surgery to become female.The lawsuit says these claims are “demonstrably false” and that Owens knew they were false. It says she still posted them to get more fame and attention. The Macrons say her words were meant to hurt them and their family. Their lawyers also say they asked her many times to stop, but she did not.The Macrons say they hope the lawsuit will end what they call a “campaign of defamation” and help set the record straight.Also Read: Candace Owens Recalls College Moment She Felt Feminism Was A Lie And Reveals The Class Blamed Men For All Problems",Candace Owens says her show will not come on air this week.

We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct.

Afridi made seven consecutive attempts to see him in jail, but he was denied by the jail authorities, whom Khan claims were controlled by an army officer.","Imran Khan's three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.

Authorities have identified the suspect in the Washington DC shooting that critically injured two National Guard members near the White House.Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the accused is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021. Officials are still verifying all his details, and the motive remains unclear.Images shared online appeared to show the suspect being taken away in handcuffs after being shot and placed on a stretcher.“This is the man who opened fire on the National Guard just one day before Thanksgiving.

Mayor Muriel Bowser and FBI director Kash Patel said both soldiers are in critical condition. President Donald Trump confirmed that the suspect was also seriously injured.The FBI is treating the incident as a possible act of terrorism, and the case is being handled as an assault on federal officers.

Hong Kong Inferno: Terrifying Visuals As Fires Sweep 7 High-Rise Towers; 36 Killed, 100s Trapped

What led to tragedy

Rapid spread across the estate





Rising casualties, mounting chaos





Voices from the ground





Mainland reaction and a shaken city









Firefighters in Hong Kong were still battling a massive blaze on Thursday after a deadly fire tore through a high-rise housing estate, killing at least 44 people and leaving hundreds missing.The disaster, financial hub's worst fire in decades, erupted suddenly on Wednesday afternoon (local time) and rapidly consumed parts of the densely packed Wang Fuk Court complex in Tai Po.The chain of events started around 2:50pm on Wednesday, when flames first broke out at the eight-building estate, home to about 2,000 units across 32-storey towers. The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but the buildings were under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding -- a traditional and flammable material still commonly used in Hong Kong.Authorities had previously warned about the danger of bamboo scaffolding after another blaze spread rapidly last October. Despite government plans to phase it out in favour of fire-resistant steel, the Wang Fuk Court estate remained covered in bamboo.By early Thursday, police had arrested three men, saying flammable materials left behind during maintenance work had allowed the blaze “to spread rapidly beyond control”.As flames ripped through the complex, AFP journalists arriving at daybreak on Thursday saw some flats still burning, although the fire had weakened overnight. Witnesses described loud cracking -- likely the bamboo collapsing -- and thick smoke billowing between the towers as fiery debris drifted in the air.A 65-year-old resident surnamed Yuen, who has lived in the estate for more than four decades, said many neighbours were elderly and unaware of the danger.""The windows were closed because of the maintenance, (some people) didn't know there was a fire and had to be told to evacuate via phone calls by neighbours,"" Yuen told AFP. ""I'm devastated.""According to Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of fire service operations, strong winds and burning debris likely pushed the flames from one building to another.""The temperature at the scene is very high and there are some floors where we have been unable to reach people who requested help, but we will keep trying,"" he said.By Thursday morning, officials confirmed 44 deaths, including a 37-year-old firefighter who was discovered with burns after losing contact with colleagues for about half an hour, fire service director Andy Yeung said.Earlier, Hong Kong leader John Lee said 279 people were unaccounted for, though firefighters later reached some of them. More than 900 residents took shelter in temporary facilities.At those shelters, police officers struggled to determine an exact count of the missing as residents continued arriving late into the night to report missing family members.The danger was still visible in the estate as charred scaffolding collapsed, flames burst from windows and a fiery orange glow illuminated nearby buildings. Residents were evacuated by coach, and local media reported that adjacent blocks were being cleared. Parts of a nearby highway were also shut down for the firefighting operation.A Tai Po resident surnamed So, 57, stood watching the devastation. ""There's nothing that can be done about the property. We can only hope that everyone, no matter old or young, can return safely,"" So told AFP.Another resident, an apartment owner in his 40s, said he could not bring himself to leave. ""The fire is not yet under control and I dare not leave, and I don't know what I can do,"" he said.Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences, including to ""the firefighter who died in the line of duty,"" and urged authorities to “make every effort to extinguish the fire and minimise casualties and losses,” state media reported.John Lee said he was ""deeply saddened"" and assured that all government departments were assisting residents.Hong Kong, once plagued by deadly fires in overcrowded districts, had seen major improvements in safety over recent decades. But the speed and scale of Wednesday’s blaze have revived concerns about building safety, construction practices and ageing infrastructure.","Firefighters still battling massive blaze on Thursday after deadly fire tore through a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong. At least 44 people killed, hundreds missing after blaze tore through Wang Fuk Court complex in Tai Po. Cause of fire not immediately known, but buildings were under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125603090,imgsize-3109747,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

National Guard Shot: Shocking Eyewitness Account; ‘They Had Somebody Pinned Down' | Washington DC'

Troops subdued the shooter

Witnesses describe chaos

Trump vows consequences





NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday condemned the shooting at White House of two National Guard soldiers and said that the suspect from Afghanistan entered the country in 2021. Calling it 'an act of terror', he urged to reinvestigate all Afghan refugees that entered under the Biden admin after the National Guard shooting.In his address from Florida, Trump said, ""Earlier today on the eve of the thanksgiving holiday, two members of the National Guard serving in Washington DC were shot at point blank range in a monstrous, ambush styled attack just steps away from the White House. This heinous assault was an act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation, it was a crime against humanity. The hearts of all Americans tonight are with those two members of the West Virginian National Guards and their families. ""Trump said that as the country is filled with anguish and grief for those shot at, ""we're also filled with rightous anger and ferocious resolve"".He said that as the President of the United States, ""the animal who perpetrated this atrocity, pays the steepest possible price.I can report tonight based on the best available information, the Department of homeland security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan- a hellhole on earth.""Trump alleged that the Afghan person was flown in by the Biden administration in 2021, ""on those infamous flights.... his status was extended under legislations signed by President Biden"" and added, ""this attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation. The last administration let in 20 million unknown foreigners from all over the world"".He said that US will now re-examine every single alien who has entered the US from Afghanistan under Biden administration and ensure removal of those who don't love America.""We are not going to put up on these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn't even be in our country. We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can't love our country, we don't want them. America will never bend or yield in the face of terror. At the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission the service members were so nobly fulfilling.""He announced that he has directed the Department of War to mobilise and additional 500 troops ""to help protect our capital city. We will make America totally safe again and we will bring the perpetrator of this barbaric attack to swift and certain justice if the bullets going in the opposite direction haven't already done that.""He said that the Guards were serving their duty to protect the nation, when they were ""gunned down in a savage attack"" and asked people to say a prayer this Thanksgiving for them.Two members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed to the nation’s capital were shot Wednesday afternoon just a few blocks from the White House, in what officials described as a bold and targeted attack. FBI director Kash Patel and Washington mayor Muriel Bowser said both service members were hospitalized in critical condition.The unusual shooting of National Guard personnel—on the eve of Thanksgiving—comes amid months of controversy over the presence of Guard troops in Washington and other US cities. Their deployment by the Trump administration has fueled legal battles and a broader debate over the use of military forces to address what officials have labeled a spiraling crime problem.A suspect, who was taken into custody, was also wounded in the confront ation. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, according to AP.Hours later, in a video message posted on social media, President Donald Trump called for a reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees admitted under the Biden administration.“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,” he said, calling the shooting “a crime against our entire nation.”DC police executive assistant chief Jeffrey Carroll said investigators have not determined a motive. Video reviewed by authorities showed the gunman “rounding the corner” and opening fire on the troops almost immediately. “This was a targeted shooting,” Bowser said.West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially announced the troops had died, but later amended his statement, saying his office was receiving “conflicting reports” about their condition.The Trump administration responded by ordering an additional 500 National Guard members to Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had directed him to send more troops. Nearly 2,200 Guard members are currently assigned to the city’s joint task force, according to the latest government update.The shooting occurred about two blocks northwest of the White House, near a metro station. Carroll said other Guard members nearby heard the gunshots, rushed to the scene, and restrained the gunman after he had been shot.“It appears to be a lone gunman who raised a firearm and ambushed these National Guard members,” Carroll said, adding that investigators have not yet determined whether the suspect was shot by a Guard member or a police officer.“At this point we have no other suspects,” he said.At least one Guard member exchanged gunfire with the attacker, according to another law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cellphone video shared on social media shortly after the attack showed first responders performing CPR on one Guard member and treating the other on a sidewalk littered with broken glass.Stacy Walters, who was sitting in her car nearby, said she heard two shots and saw people running before law enforcement rapidly descended on the scene. “It’s such a beautiful day. Who would do this? And right before the holidays?” she said.Emma McDonald, who had just exited a metro station when the shots were fired, said she and others sheltered inside a café. Minutes later, she saw first responders rush past, pushing a stretcher carrying a badly wounded Guard member.From Florida, where he is spending Thanksgiving, Trump called the gunman an “animal” who “will pay a very steep price.” “God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People,” he wrote on Truth Social.Speaking in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, vice president JD Vance asked people of faith to pray for the wounded. He noted that much remains unknown, including the motive.“It’s a somber reminder that our soldiers—active duty, reserve, or National Guard—are the sword and shield of the United States,” Vance told troops gathered for a Thanksgiving message.Gen. Steven Nordhaus, chief of the National Guard Bureau, canceled planned holiday visits to troops at Guantanamo Bay so he could travel to Washington to be with Guard members there.In August, Trump issued an emergency order federalizing the local police force and deploying Guard units from eight states and the District of Columbia. Although the order expired a month later, the troops stayed. Last week, a federal judge ordered the deployment to end, but paused her ruling for 21 days to allow time for an appeal or for the administration to withdraw the troops.Guard members have been patrolling neighborhoods, transit stations, and other areas; staffing highway checkpoints; and even assisting with trash collection and security at sporting events.","US President Donald Trump condemned the shooting at White House of two National Guard soldiers and said that the suspect from Afghanistan entered the country in 2021.

Bengaluru Doctor Arrested For Allegedly Killing Wife With Anesthesia Overdose Months After Wedding

NEW DELHI: A 38-year-old woman, the daughter-in-law of an industrialist, allegedly died by suicide at home in southwest Delhi's Vasant Vihar on Tuesday. Police have initiated an inquest to probe the circumstances leading to the death.No suicide note was found, but police said it had seized a diary in which the woman, a housewife, wrote about her relationship with her husband and about love and trust. ""In the probe till now, she has not blamed anyone in the diary,"" a senior officer said. The statements of the husband and her family members have been recorded.The husband found her unconscious in their bedroom and took her to hospital. She was declared dead on arrival and the hospital informed police about the death around 12pm.""The body was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital's mortuary and a post-mortem was conducted,"" the officer said. The body was then handed over to the family for her last rites.According to police, the couple got married in 2010. The proceedings are underway under Section 194 (inquest proceedings to inquire and report on suicide and unnatural deaths) of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.The family's lawyer, Rajinder Singh, said the woman's husband had gone to gym at 9am while their children were at school.""He received a call from the woman's mother at the gym that she was not answering the phone. On reaching home, he opened the bedroom door and found her unconscious,"" Singh said. He called household staff and took her to hospital within five minutes, Singh added. No other family member was present at home. ""We are not aware of any suicide note,"" he said.At the hospital mortuary, the woman's brother claimed that the couple's relationship was strained. He alleged that she was beaten up and her husband was involved in an affair. ""My sister had called and told me about the torture,"" he claimed.The lawyer called the allegations completely baseless. ""They have two children and were living happily for 15 years. Her mother has been with us since Tuesday. The families did not even wish to conduct a post-mortem and wanted to cremate her together with full respect,"" he said.","38-year-old woman, daughter-in-law of industrialist, allegedly died by suicide at home.

Trump ‘GETS ANGRY’ At Chicago Guv After Woman Burnt Alive By 'Illegal Alien’; Drops Troops Threat





In an interesting turn of events, a relative of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was detained as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement efforts, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News.Leavitt, a close aide to US President Donald Trump, has previously referred to immigrants as “illegal criminal aliens” and accused the Democratic Party of “opening our borders” and allowing “millions of illegal aliens into our country” over the past four years.The woman detained is the mother of Leavitt’s nephew. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Bruna Caroline Ferreira in Revere, Massachusetts, earlier this month, the source said.A department of homeland security spokesperson described her as a “criminal illegal alien from Brazil” who overstayed a tourist visa that expired in June 1999. The spokesperson added that Ferreira has an arrest on suspicion of battery, though it is unclear how that case was resolved.Ferreira is being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center as officials move forward with removal proceedings. DHS noted that under President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, “all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”The source familiar with the situation said Leavitt’s nephew has lived full time with his father in New Hampshire since birth, has never lived with his mother, and has not spoken with her in many years. The source also said Ferreira has never lived with the child.Ferreira’s family offered a different view in a GoFundMe campaign, saying she was brought to the United States in 1998 as a child and has done “everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here.” The campaign also says she “maintained her legal status” through protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.The Associated Press reported Tuesday that DACA recipients have been among those detained in recent immigration sweeps. Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement published in the AP story that DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they've committed a crime.”","A relative of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was detained as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement efforts.

At least 44 people were killed and 279 remain unaccounted for after a massive fire swept through a high rise housing estate in Hong Kong, prompting an overnight rescue operation and urgent appeals for accountability from city authorities.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee confirmed the rising toll early Thursday (local time), saying search teams were still tracing missing residents as smoke continued to billow from the charred towers.Earlier accounts from officials described how the fire services department initially handled 28 casualties, with nine declared dead at the scene. Several more critically injured residents later died in hospital as flames continued to rage through the densely packed residential towers. Two residents remain in critical condition with burn injuries, while others including firefighters also required medical attention.Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly. State media reported that Xi called on authorities to “make every effort” to put out the fire and minimise further loss of life. “Xi Jinping expressed condolences for those who died in the major fire at a residential estate in Tai Po District, New Territories, Hong Kong, including the firefighter who died in the line of duty,” CCTV said.The Fire Services Department said it received the first emergency call at 2:51 pm local time and escalated the blaze to a No 4 alarm at 3:34 pm, one level below the highest emergency classification. Dozens of engines, ambulances and rescue teams were deployed as smoke poured from the towers, which house around 2,000 apartments and were undergoing renovation work. Witnesses described seeing residents gathered on overhead walkways as flames climbed rapidly up buildings covered in bamboo scaffolding.The Tai Po district, home to nearly 300,000 people, is among Hong Kong’s most tightly packed urban zones. Roads around the area remain closed, with bus routes diverted as firefighters continue sweeping each floor to locate survivors.More details are awaited as authorities verify the number of missing residents and assess structural safety before entering deeper sections of the complex.","Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.

Parents allege ‘culture of bullying’ at private school

(With agency inputs)

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, "" it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive""According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.Several parents gathered at Shaheed Smarak Saturday to protest and demand action against Neerja Modi School, where 9-year-old Amaira Kumar fell to her death from the fourth floor on Nov 1. They alleged that incidents of bullying at the school were ""not isolated, but rampant"".","The Central Board of Secondary Education issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur.

From chainsaws to silence: DOGE's brief tenure



DOGE staff scattered across government as agency dissolves







The Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk that dominated the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter, according to Reuters, in what appears to be the administration's ultimate cost-saving measure.""That doesn't exist,"" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters when asked about DOGE's status, confirming it is no longer a ""centralised entity."" The OPM has since absorbed many of DOGE's functions, marking the end of an agency that promised sweeping government reform but delivered questionable results.Created in January through executive order, DOGE was expected to operate through July 2026. The agency made dramatic efforts to shrink federal agencies, cut budgets, and redirect work to Trump priorities in its early months. Elon Musk, who initially led the department, regularly promoted its work on social media and famously brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, declaring it ""the chainsaw for bureaucracy. ""DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but outside financial experts found it impossible to verify these claims because the unit never provided detailed public accounting.The agency's website still claims approximately $214 billion in savings, though a Politico review found the numbers were inflated by counting maximum possible contract values rather than actual spending reductions.The shut down follows Musk's public feud with Trump in May, after which Musk left Washington and exited DOGE. Musk's ""right-hand man,"" Steve Davis , also departed shortly after his boss's exit.By May, more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts.Former DOGE employees have moved to new positions throughout the administration.

Zachary Terrell, part of the DOGE team given access to government health systems early in Trump's second term, is now chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, while Rachel Riley, who had similar access, now serves as chief of the Office of Naval Research.Jeremy Lewin, who helped Musk dismantle the US Agency for International Development, now oversees foreign assistance at the State Department.

SHOCK VIDEO: Watch How National Guard Captured & Stripped Afghan Attacker In DC After Shooting





The United States on Thursday announced an indefinite halt to all immigration requests involving Afghan nationals, following a shooting incident near the White House in Washington, DC, in which the suspect was identified as an Afghan national.The US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS) confirmed the decision on X, saying: ""Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.""It added, ""The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission.""According to law enforcement sources cited by CBS News, the suspect is 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021. Authorities are still verifying his background, and the motive behind the attack remains unclear.The shooting left two West Virginia National Guard members critically injured after they were attacked Wednesday afternoon just blocks from the White House. They had been deployed to the capital, and the mayor described the incident as a targeted act of violence. FBI director Kash Patel and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said the soldiers were hospitalised in critical condition.Officials said the 29-year-old suspect arrived in the US through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program that facilitated the evacuation and resettlement of tens of thousands of Afghans after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.The initiative brought nearly Afghans to the country, many of whom had worked with American forces. The program has faced scrutiny from Republicans, President Donald Trump, and government watchdogs over the speed of admissions and potential gaps in security vetting, even as advocates argue it protected people vulnerable to Taliban reprisals.Lakanwal, who had been living in Washington state, was identified by law enforcement officials, though authorities were still working to fully verify his background, according to two law enforcement officials and a person familiar with the investigation who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Trump condemned the shooting, calling it “an act of terror” and asserting that the suspect entered the country in 2021. He urged a reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees admitted under the Biden administration following the attack on the National Guard members.In a video message released Wednesday night, Trump said: “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,” adding that the shooting was “a crime against our entire nation.”","US announces indefinite halt to all immigration requests involving Afghan nationals.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh govt employees can now have more than two kids without fear of losing a job. The state govt has decided to lift the two-child restriction that was in place for its employees since 2001.The general administration department (GAD) has recently sent a proposal to lift the two-child norm ban for its staff to the chief minister’s secretariat and once it is cleared by the cabinet the new rules will come into immediate effect, said a senior official. The restriction has been in placesince 2001, and the timing of its lifting has raised eyebrows among political and administrative circles. The issue first came to fore when RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat warned in Nagpur on Dec 1 last that there needed to be at least three children in a family. After keeping the matter on hold for ten months, the MP govt indicated in Oct that it would submit the proposal to the state cabinet. In MP, the proposal to lift the ban was finalised after three months of discussions at different levels and inputs from senior officials, said secretariat sources.Speaking on the final day of the ‘100 Years Journey of RSS: New Horizons’ series, Bhagwat said demographic changes always have serious social and political effects,“All scriptures say that societies with very few children gradually disappear.So, this balance must be maintained. Having three children is the right thing,” he said.Neighbouring states of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have lifted similar restrictions in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Meanwhile, in MP, the proposal to lift the ban was finalised after three months of discussions at different levels and inputs from senior officials, said sources.","Madhya Pradesh govt has decided to lift the two-child restriction that was in place for its employees since 2001.

Europe's Shocking Pitch Amid US-led Ukraine Peace Talks, Makes 'Anti-Russia' Declaration





US President Donald Trump said Tuesday his plan to end the war in Ukraine has been ""fine-tuned"" and he's sending envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and army secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials. He suggested he could eventually meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but not until further progress has been made in negotiations.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday evening aboard Air Force One, Trump said resolving the war was difficult, and described what had been a 28-point plan as a work in progress. ""That was not a plan - it was a concept,"" Trump said.On Wednesday, a Russian diplomat said the Kremlin won't make big concessions on the peace plan, after a leaked recording of a call involving Witkoff showed he had advised Moscow on how to pitch to Trump. While Trump said that progress was being made and Moscow was making concessions, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said, ""There can be no question of any concessions, or any surrender of our approaches to those key points. ""Moscow also raised concerns about the leak to Bloomberg News of the transcript of a call between Witkoff and Putin's foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov. Trump, on Air Force One, brushed aside a question from a reporter about why Witkoff appeared to be coaching Russian officials as simply ""what a dealmaker does"" and ""a very standard form of negotiation"".But Russia said the leak was an unacceptable attempt to undermine peace efforts and amounted to hybrid warfare.European countries, which are alarmed by Russia's aggression and see their own future at stake in negotiations over Ukraine, are fighting to make their voices heard in the talks as Washington takes the lead.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Wednesday that Europe wants the war to end as quickly as possible. ""But an agreement negotiated by great powers without the approval of the Ukrainians and without the approval of the Europeans won't be a basis for a real, sustainable peace in Ukraine,"" Merz told lawmakers in Berlin. ""Europe is not a plaything, but a sovereign actor for its own interests and values.""The head of the European Union 's executive, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, was upbeat about recent developments, saying there is ""an opportunity here to make real progress"" toward peace.She insisted that any settlement must include future security guarantees for Ukraine. Von der Leyen added that a deal can't contain limitations on Ukraine's armed forces or block its path to Nato membership.

USCIS may deny green cards even for those who already have them.

There will be no appeal against the denial and the only legal option will be to contest the removal order in an immigration court.





The Donald Trump administration has made a major decision to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the US by the previous Joe Biden administration.

Trump Tells Female Reporter ‘Quiet, Piggy’ After Being Asked About Epstein Files





US president Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at a New York Times reporter, calling her “ugly inside and out”. The comment came after the newspaper published a story questioning whether the 80-year-old president was slowing down.Trump’s criticism was directed at Katie Rogers, one of the reporters who wrote the piece. In a Truth Social post, he accused her of being “assigned to write only bad things” about him and called her a “third-rate reporter”.“The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” he wrote. The president then wrote about how hard he has worked this year.He further said, “There will be a day when I run low on energy, it happens to everyone, but with a perfect physical exam and a comprehensive cognitive test (‘that was aced’) just recently taken, it certainly is not now.”The New York Times had reported that Trump was showing signs of tiredness in recent weeks, noting that he appeared drowsy during an event at the Oval Office earlier this month. The article also mentioned ongoing questions about his health after he confirmed undergoing an MRI in October, which he said was part of a routine physical.The newspaper stood by its reporting. A spokesperson said the story was based on first-hand information and added that personal attacks would not stop its journalists from covering the administration.“Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders,” it reads.Trump has repeatedly targeted female reporters with sharp and personal remarks. Less than two weeks ago, he called a Bloomberg correspondent “piggy” on Air Force One. He also recently dismissed an ABC News reporter as a “terrible person” during a tense exchange over questions on Jamal Khashoggi and the Epstein files.Over the years, Trump has often directed his harshest language at women in the press, using terms like “nasty” and referring to menstruation to brush aside tough questions.","The New York Times had reported that Trump was showing signs of tiredness in recent weeks.

Georgia prosecutor kills 2020 election interference case against Trump and allies





A judge in Georgia has dismissed the last pending criminal case against president Donald Trump, ending efforts to charge him for trying to overturn the 2020 election.With this, all three criminal cases filed against him before his re-election have now been taken down. Charges against his co-accused, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, were also dropped.The Georgia case was considered a major legal threat because a state conviction cannot be undone by a presidential pardon. But on Wednesday, Pete Skandalakis, who leads the state’s nonpartisan prosecutor council, asked the court to close the case. He said the earlier charges brought by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis did not hold, arguing that challenging election results is not a crime.Skandalakis also said the federal investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith was the proper venue to review Trump’s actions. He pointed to the Supreme Court ruling giving presidents “absolute immunity” for official acts, saying it would delay any Georgia trial until after Trump leaves office in 2029, which he felt was not practical for the people of Georgia.Trump’s lawyer Steve Sadow welcomed the decision, calling the case political. The case had already faced setbacks after Willis was removed over her past relationship with a lawyer she had hired for the prosecution.Trump was first indicted in August 2023, linked to his 2021 call asking Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” enough votes to change the result. The case expanded to include 18 allies. After Trump returned to office, federal prosecutors also dropped two other cases against him. He still has a separate New York conviction for falsifying business records.","Georgia prosecutor kills 2020 election interference case against Trump and allies.

""FBI personnel are assisting with the investigation into the shooting of our National Guard members in D.C. Please take a moment and pray for these heroes and their families. God bless America, and all those who defend Her,"" said Bongino on X.Patel also condemned the shooting of two National Guardsmen as a “heinous act” and pledged to bring those responsible to justice. “Since this is an assault on a federal law enforcement officer, this will be treated at the federal level as an assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” Patel said.He added that “the FBI will lead out on that mission with our interagency partners to include the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, ATF, DEA, and we’re thankful for the mayor’s assistance in this matter,” referring to Mayor Muriel Bowser, who stood beside him at the afternoon news conference.Incoming flights to Reagan Washington National Airport were briefly halted because aircraft responding to the shooting involving two National Guardsmen were operating in the area, the Federal Aviation Administration said.Departures were unaffected, and normal operations have since resumed.The airport, located just outside the federal district, sits on the same rail line as the station near the shooting scene.

Among the claims were allegations of misusing government aircraft for personal jaunts to visit his girlfriend, controversial decisions regarding the handling of Jeffrey Epstein's case, and the dismissal of senior FBI personnel.

Trump To FIRE Kash Patel As FBI Director? White House Denies, Slams ‘FAKE’ MS NOW Report

Here are some of the controversies involving Patel:

1. Girlfriend Alexis Wilkins

2. Jeffrey Epstein Files

3. Purge of FBI Senior Staff

4. Polygraph and loyalty vetting controversy

5. Shein and private business ties





Indian-origin Kash Patel has brought a lot of controversy with him since he was appointed as the FBI director under the Trump administration.His influence in the MAGA base has overshadowed a lot of his drama, but there are still some things that left an imprint on the common people, which the Democrats now use as fuel for their propaganda.Kash Patel is under fire for using a government-owned jet for trips that appear personal, including travel to see his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, perform at wrestling events. These flights are funded by taxpayers and have raised questions about misuse of federal resources and adherence to proper protocol in such high positions.In addition, Patel reportedly deployed FBI SWAT agents to provide security for Wilkins at public appearances. This move misused elite personnel normally reserved for high-risk operations. Patel’s office has defended both the jet use and SWAT protection, insisting all actions followed agency rules.Patel faced backlash after Congressman Suhas Subramanyam wrote to him regarding the security of Jeffrey Epstein files released by the FBI. The congressman said that it cannot be ruled out that tampering or political interference is possible under Trump administration, questioning Patel’s role in handling sensitive documents.Democrats said that the influence of MAGA allies could have compromised the integrity of the release process. Patel denied any misconduct, but the row regarding debate over transparency and impartiality in federal investigations only grew, particularly those involving high-profile figures.Before his confirmation, Patel was accused of orchestrating the removal of senior FBI staff. Whistle-blowers alleged that Patel personally influenced dismissals of top bureau officials. This was seen as an abuse of power, raising concerns that political loyalty, rather than merit or misconduct, guided personnel decisions. Senators and watchdogs said that such actions could compromise the independence of the FBI.Progressives claimed that these dismissals compromised institutional memory and morale, while Patel and his office denied any wrongdoing.Patel reportedly oversaw an expansion of polygraph testing within the FBI. He did it for national-security purposes and also to detect leaks and assess internal loyalty. Some agents were reportedly questioned about personal opinions or criticisms of Patel. Former employees described a climate of fear where dissent was discouraged or silenced. The process allegedly led to forced resignations or departures of senior and mid-level staff, damaging morale.Patel’s financial interests in private companies, including holdings connected to the fast-fashion firm Shein, have stirred a row, as owning such shares raises questions for someone holding a high public office.Critics argue that ownership stakes in firms with overseas manufacturing and labor controversies could present conflicts of interest, particularly for a senior national security official. Past consultancy contracts with foreign-linked clients have also been brought up for questioning. Patel has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that his private business dealings did not interfere with his official duties.","Kash Patel's time as FBI chief during the Trump administration stirred considerable debate.
