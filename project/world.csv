Owner still absconding

Saurabh Luthra

NEW DELHI: Police on Monday detained another manager linked to the tragic Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire in Goa that claimed 25 lives.The accused was identified as Bharat. According to police, he used to run daily operation of Birch by Romeo Lane at the club.The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night, which claimed 25 lives and injured six others.Until last year, Luthra had aimed to launch 50 restaurants across India, but his weekend property turned into the site of one of Goa’s worst nightlife tragedies.Luthra’s LinkedIn profile lists him as ‘Chairman at Romeo Lane, Birch and Mama’s Buoi’. Activist Tahir Noronha described him as “like a ghost,” saying he rarely stays in Goa and often avoids legal proceedings, sending representatives in his place.“He is out of touch with the impact of his ventures,” Noronha said. Socialites and staff also described him as aloof; Jayesh Diukar, a kitchen staffer who survived the fire, said Luthra visited the club only once a month and rarely interacted with employees.At least 100-200 persons were on the dance floor of a nightclub in North Goa when a fire broke out there, and in an attempt to escape, some of them ran downstairs to its kitchen where they got trapped along with the staff.While the state police said the blaze occurred at the nightclub due to a cylinder blast after midnight on Sunday, some of the eyewitnesses claimed the fire started on the club's first floor, where tourists were dancing.Most of the dead were the club's kitchen workers, and included three women, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. There were “three to four tourists” among those killed, he added.""There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,"" Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad, told PTI at Arpora in the wee hours of Sunday.","The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night.

GOA: Another harrowing video has emerged from Goa showing the moment a fire broke out at a popular nightclub, capturing guests fleeing for their lives.The blaze occurred late on Saturday at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora during a belly-dance performance.In the footage, flames can be seen spreading rapidly across the first-floor dance area, sending people scrambling in panic.Smoke quickly filled the club, forcing some guests to flee to the basement kitchen, where 23 victims suffocated. Two others were later found on a staircase.Around 150 people were present in the DJ and dance area at the time. Initial investigations suggest the fire was triggered by electric firecrackers striking the wooden ceiling, rather than a gas cylinder, which had been speculated earlier.The victims included 20 staff members from various Indian states and Nepal, and five tourists.The club, situated on a salt pan with a single narrow access lane, had inadequate fire safety measures, which delayed rescue efforts. Authorities said it was operating without proper licences and violated building norms.Following the incident, four club staff members were arrested, and the owners, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, have been named in an FIR for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A police team has been dispatched to Delhi to serve arrest warrants.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of ₹2 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured. The state government has also sealed another club owned by the Luthras for inadequate safety measure",The blaze occurred late on Saturday at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora during a belly-dance performance.

NEW DELHI: The owners of Birch by Romeo Lane, the north Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people, left the country just hours after the blaze, police confirmed on Monday, even as one of them posted a message expressing ""profound grief"" over the tragedy.Goa Police said that soon after an FIR was registered, a team was dispatched to New Delhi to raid the residences of brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra. The houses were found locked, a notice was pasted, and checks with the Bureau of Immigration revealed that both had boarded a 5.30 am flight to Phuket, barely a few hours after the fire that erupted past midnight, news agency PTI reported.A Look Out Circular was issued on December 7, and police have now sought the help of the CBI’s Interpol Division to trace and detain the duo. ""Their departure immediately after the incident indicates intent to evade investigation,"" a senior officer told PTI.Even as police chased leads, an Instagram statement surfaced from owner Saurabh Luthra, saying he was ""deeply shaken by the tragic loss of lives"" and expressing solidarity with families of the deceased and injured. In the post, Luthra said the establishment would offer ""every possible form of assistance, support and cooperation.""Meanwhile, four staff members, including the chief general manager, general manager, bar manager and gate manager, have been arrested and remanded to police custody. FIRs have been filed against the Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch and Romeo Lane chain.The Goa government has ordered a magisterial inquiry, constituted a multi-agency committee, and asked for a report on procedural lapses within one week.Meanwhile, police have completed autopsies and returned all 25 bodies, 20 staffers and five tourists, including four from Delhi, to their families.","The owners of the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people, left the country just hours after the blaze, police confirmed on Monday.

Are sub-critical tests covered under 123 Agreement?

World's nuclear arsenal

In an era where global powers are flexing their nuclear muscles and dormant arsenals hum with renewed urgency, India stands at a perilous crossroads: should it reignite the fire of nuclear testing to assert its strategic sovereignty, or maintain the delicate restraint that has balanced diplomacy and deterrence for decades?The shadow of India's 1998 Pokhran-II tests still lingers, marked by geopolitical reverberations and economic sanctions. Yet today, with US President Donald Trump publicly accusing rival states like Pakistan and China of clandestine nuclear tests, India faces a high-stakes dilemma.India's nuclear journey began with its first nuclear test, code-named 'Smiling Buddha', in 1974, which stunned the world with a bold demonstration of atomic capability.However, there was then a long gap of 24 years before India conducted its next round of tests, the definitive Pokhran-II in 1998.Now, 27 years after that landmark moment, the clock ticks again — prompting a crucial question: Is it time for India to conduct another series of nuclear tests to secure its place amid a shifting geopolitical order? The answer may shape not just India's nuclear strategy, but the future stability of South Asia and its global standing.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, said that a resumption of US atomic tests would ""open the door for states with less nuclear testing experience to conduct full-scale tests that could help them perfect smaller, lighter warhead designs"".Joseph Rodgers, fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said that states such as China or India stand to profit from a resumption of nuclear tests.“It makes more sense for them to test” than it does for the US or Russia, the two states that have conducted most atomic tests to date, Rodgers said.Ahead of his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping in South Korea on October 29–30, 2025, Trump posted on social media that, because other countries were conducting nuclear tests, he had instructed the US military to begin testing nuclear weapons again on ""an equal basis"" with those nations, and that this process would ""commence immediately"".Trump's comments were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.In an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, Trump reiterated his position. ""I am saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,"" Trump said when asked by if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.""Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,"" he added. ""I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,"" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.Just days after Trump's remark, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that America is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions.""These are not nuclear explosions,"" Wright told Fox News on Sunday. ""These are what we call sub-critical explosions."" But Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have ""no worries"" about seeing a mushroom cloud.""Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,"" Wright said. ""So we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.""Sub-critical nuclear testing refers to experiments that involve nuclear materials like plutonium but use less than the amount necessary to start a chain reaction that would cause a nuclear explosion.No nuclear explosion occurs because the test does not achieve ""criticality,"" the point at which a self-sustaining nuclear reaction happens.These tests involve compressing or shocking small amounts of fissile material with high explosives to study how the material behaves under extreme conditions.Subcritical tests help scientists validate computer models and ensure the safety, security, and reliability of nuclear weapons without performing full nuclear detonations.They are usually done underground to contain any radioactive byproducts and prevent a nuclear blast.Countries like the US, Russia, and China use subcritical tests to maintain their nuclear stockpiles under international test bans like the CTBT.Thus, subcritical tests are a way to ""test"" the components of nuclear weapons at a small, safe scale without violating nuclear test bans or triggering nuclear explosions.Sub-critical nuclear tests are generally very low-yield and do not produce a nuclear explosion, so they release minimal energy and radiation. Because of this, subcritical tests are often difficult or impossible to detect by international monitoring systems like the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) International Monitoring System (IMS).The IMS uses seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide stations to detect nuclear explosions worldwide. While it can detect all full-scale nuclear tests, the very low yield of subcritical tests—often below a threshold of about 1 kiloton equivalent—means they usually do not produce detectable seismic or atmospheric signatures. Radionuclide detectors also rely on gases released during an explosion, which do not occur in subcritical tests.Sub-critical tests are mostly not picked up by the IMS or satellite monitoring, making them effectively clandestine from the perspective of existing international nuclear test detection systems unless detected through other intelligence sources or on-site inspections after the CTBT enters into force.If India were to conduct a nuclear test today, it would reflect significantly evolved scientific, strategic, and geopolitical conditions compared to the 1998 Pokhran-II tests.The characteristics of a modern Indian nuclear test would likely include:The 123 Agreement, formally called the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement, is a bilateral pact signed in 2008 that allows civil nuclear trade and cooperation between India and the United States.It was a landmark deal that ended decades of nuclear isolation for India, enabling it to engage in global nuclear commerce despite not being a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The agreement requires India to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, with civilian reactors subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards while retaining control of its nuclear weapons program.The 123 Agreement facilitates technology transfer, fuel supply, and nuclear commerce, strengthening India’s civilian nuclear energy capabilities and strategic partnership with the US.Per Article 14 of the 123 Agreement, should India conduct a nuclear test explosion, the United States holds the right to immediately terminate all nuclear cooperation. This has significant ramifications for India’s civilian nuclear energy expansion plans and international standing. Past statements by US policymakers, including former US president Barack Obama, emphasized pushing for India’s eventual ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as part of broader nonproliferation goals.The 123 Agreement between India and the United States does not explicitly mention subcritical nuclear testing.The agreement is primarily focused on prohibiting ""nuclear explosive devices"" testing and maintaining a moratorium on nuclear testing as a condition for continued civil nuclear cooperation.Subcritical tests, which do not involve a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction or an actual nuclear explosion, typically fall outside the scope of what is conventionally defined as nuclear explosive testing.This nuance means subcritical tests are not explicitly banned under the 123 Agreement’s terms related to nuclear testing moratoriums.However, any full nuclear explosive test would constitute a breach, prompting the US to have the right to terminate cooperation and possibly impose sanctions.At present there are 9 countries (Russia, US, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea) that possess nuclear weapons.These countries have roughly 12,331 nuclear warheads, with over 9,600 in active military stockpiles, according to the Federation of Atomic Scientists' 2025 Status of the Worlds Nuclear Forces.While this is a significant decline from the approximately 70,000 warheads owned by the nuclear-armed states during the Cold War, nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade.Russia has the most confirmed nuclear weapons, with nearly 5,500 nuclear warheads. The US follows behind with 5,177 nuclear weapons. Total nuclear warheads owned by these 2 countries alone counts for nearly 90% of nuclear weapons in the world.Over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests have been carried out since 1945.The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the Tsar Bomba of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50–58 megatons.","India's nuclear journey began with its first nuclear test, code-named 'Smiling Buddha', in 1974. It took 24 years before India conducted its next round of tests, the definitive Pokhran-II in 1998. Now, 27 years after that landmark moment, the clock ticks again.

Vande Mataram debate: Priyanka Gandhi's 'chronology' jab at Centre; questions PM Modi's 'selective' history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-matram-debate-priyanka-gandhis-chronology-jab-at-centre-questions-pm-modis-selective-history/articleshow/125833088.cms,"'Only 2 Reasons': Priyanka Gandhi Slams PM Modi, Links Vande Mataram Debate To Bengal Polls

NEW DLEHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha, alleging that his recent speech during the Vande Mataram anniversary debate lacked ‘facts’ and historical details. While acknowledging the PM’s oratory, she said he “falls weak on the facts,” and went on to take a ""chronology"" jab at the government, describing how Vande Matram was introduced as the national song.Vadra questioned why the PM did not mention that “in 1896 Rabindranath Tagore sang Vande Mataram for the first time at a Congress convention,” asking, “was it Hindu Mahasabha, was it RSS, what were you attempting to hide that it was a Congress convention?”Recounting the song’s origins, she said Bankim Chattopadhyay wrote the first two stanzas in 1875, followed by the publication of Anandamath in 1882, which included additional stanzas. She noted that Vande Mataram emerged as a symbol of unity during the 1905 anti-partition movement of Bengal, when “stalwart freedom fighters like Rabindranath Tagore hit the street singing the songs.”""Soon, people from all walks of life started singing. Understand the power of this song - Britishers used to dread the song, our bravehearts used to find strength after listening to the song to fight the Raj.The song invokes the feeling of dying for the motherland - this is the real power of this song,"" she said.Also read: 'Only two reasons' - Priyanka Gandhi targets government over Vande Matram debate; brings in 'Bengal election' Vadra argued that the song became politicised in the 1930s amid rising communal divides. She then criticised the PM for selectively quoting correspondence between Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru.She said that ahead of the 1937 Congress convention in Kolkata, Bose wrote to Nehru on October 17, stating, “We shall have a talk in Calcutta, and also discuss the question in the working committee if you bring it up there. I have written to Dr Tagore to discuss the matter with you when you visit Shanti Niketan.”According to her, Nehru’s reply on October 20 included more than the line read by the PM. She quoted Nehru as saying, “There is no doubt that the present outcry against Vande Mataram is to a large extent manufactured by the communalists… whatever we do, we can’t pander to communalist feelings.”Vadra added that after Tagore met Nehru, Tagore wrote that he supported separating the first two stanzas, noting their deep significance and warning that the later additions “can be misconstrued as communal.”She said that on October 28, the Congress Working Committee, with Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel and Tagore present, declared the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram as the national song.She went on to say, “When in 1950, Dr Rajendra Prasad in constituent assembly announced the song as our national song almost all of these leaders were present and along with them was Dr Ambedkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee but no one had an issue with it.”She accused the ruling dispensation of revealing an anti-constitution mindset by questioning Vande Matram’s current form.“Questioning the current form of Vande Matram isn’t just insulting to all those stalwarts who in their great wisdom took this decision but it also reveals an anti-constitutional mentality. Are the treasury benches so arrogant to think of themselves as bigger than Gandhi, Tagore, Maulana Azad, Neta ji Bose, Rajendra Prasad?” she said.She went on to add, “The PM's statement that the national song was cut by an anti-national ideology is an insult to all those great leaders, those who devoted their entire lives to the freedom struggle. By accusing them of dividing Vande Matram you’re accusing the entire constituent assembly. This is a direct attack on our constituent assembly and our constitution.”Vadra later defended Nehru and recounted his contribution to the state, asserting if he would not have laid the foundation of multiple institutions like IITs and AIIMS, how would we have become Vikshit Bharat.“Insofar Jawaharlal Nehru is considered, for as long the PM Modi has been the Prime Minister, that’s 12-years, Nehru spent that much time in jail for what? For the independence of the country, and after that 17-years as the country's PM. You criticise him but if he wouldn’t have established ISRO your Mangalyan wouldn’t be there, if there was no DRDO your Tejas wouldn’t exist, if he wouldn’t have established IITs and IIM’s, then would not have led in IT…if he wouldn’t have established the institutions which you’re selling today, so would this Viksit Bharat exist? Pandit Nehru lived for the country and died serving this nation. ”Earlier in the day opening the debate on Vande Matram PM Modi told the Lok Sabha that “Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a letter to Subhash Chandra Bose after Jinnah’s opposition to Vande Mataram, stating that he had read the background of Vande Mataram and thought it might provoke and irritate Muslims. He added that they would examine the use of Vande Mataram, and that too in Bankim Chandra’s Bengal.”Setting the debate in the context of what he described as the Congress’ past compromises with the Muslim League, the Prime Minister argued that the party had weakened the song’s legacy and “fragmented” it, undermining the sentiments of the freedom movement.He said the decisive moment came on October 26 that year. “The Vande Mataram song was sung. But it is the misfortune of the country that on October 26, the Congress compromised on Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram ke tukde kardiye. That decision was a failure, a betrayal,” he said, adding that the Congress “bowed to the Muslim League and decided to fragment Vande Mataram.”","Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha.

Da or Babu?

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Roy on Monday interrupted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address on Vande Mataram in the Lok Sabha over the choice of words he used to refer to the composer of the national song, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.During his speech, the Prime Minister, on one occasion, referred to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee as “Bankim Da.” Roy immediately objected to the remark and said that PM Modi should use “Bankim Babu” instead.PM Modi quickly corrected himself and said, “I will say Bankim Babu. Thank you, I respect your sentiments.”“Can I call you dada, or is that also an issue?” he added.In the Bengali language, “Da” is the short form of “dada,” meaning elder brother. It is also used informally for someone older in a friendly way.On the other hand, “Babu” is a more formal and respectable suffix used for educated, respected gentlemen. At times, it is also used sarcastically to refer to the Bhadralok Bengalis who adapted to British culture.In the 10-hour discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament, PM Modi recounted how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance. Back then, from matchboxes to large ships, ‘Vande Mataram’ was written as a tradition. It became a means to challenge foreign companies and emerged as a slogan of the Swadeshi movement.”He described the song as something far deeper than a political chant. “Vande Mataram was not just a mantra for political independence. It was not limited to our independence; it was way beyond that. The freedom movement was a war to free our motherland from the clutches of slavery... During our Vedas, it was said: This land is my mother, and I am the son of the soil.”PM Modi also invoked Mahatma Gandhi, telling the House, “In the weekly Indian Opinion on 2 December 1905, Mahatma Gandhi wrote that the song Vande Mataram, composed by Bankim Chandra, had become famous across Bengal... He wrote that this song was so popular it had become like our national anthem, carrying deeper emotions and more melody than the national songs of other countries.”The Prime Minister asked why the song suffered “injustice” in the last century. “Vande Mataram was so great, then why did injustice happen to it in the last century? Why was there betrayal with Vande Mataram? Which were those powers whose wishes overshadowed the emotions of Mahatma Gandhi?” he said, arguing that Congress’ compromises ultimately fed into the conditions that led to Partition. “Congress compromised on Vande Mataram and, as a result, had to accept the decision of the country’s Partition. ”PM Modi urged Parliament to treat the occasion as a moment of national reaffirmation. “Some great people of India dreamed of a free India, and today’s generation dreams of a prosperous India. The inspiration for both is Vande Mataram,” he said, adding that India must become “Aatmanirbhar and Viksit by 2047.”","All India Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Roy interrupted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address on Vande Mataram in the Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday launched a sharp attack on the Prime Minister and claimed that the Centre wanted the discussion on Vande Mataram in the Lok Sabha to serve its poll prospects in the upcoming Assembly elections in West Bengal.During her address in the Lok Sabha, Priyanka said that there are two reasons for the debate on the national song in Parliament.“There are two reasons for the debate on Vande Mataram in the House today. Elections are approaching in Bengal. In such a situation, our esteemed Prime Minister wishes to establish his role.”“Those who fought the freedom struggle, who made sacrifices for the country—this government seeks an opportunity to level new accusations against them. By doing so, the Modi government wishes to divert the country’s attention from the essential issues concerning the people,” she added.“You (BJP) are for the elections, we are for the country. No matter how many elections we lose, we will sit here and keep fighting you and your ideology. We will keep fighting for our country. You cannot stop us,” she further said.Earlier in the day, PM Modi launched a fierce attack on the Congress, accusing the party of repeatedly compromising on the national song — from the freedom movement to the years after Independence.Framing the discussion around what he described as Congress’ historic concessions to the Muslim League, the Prime Minister said the party had “fragmented” the song and betrayed the spirit of the freedom struggle.In the 10-hour discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament, PM Modi recounted how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance.

It was not limited to our independence; it was way beyond that. The freedom movement was a war to free our motherland from the clutches of slavery... During our Vedas, it was said: This land is my mother, and I am the son of the soil.”Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi hit out at PM Modi and accused him of using his speech during the Lok Sabha discussion on Vande Mataram to “rewrite history” and give a “political colour” to the debate.Gogoi said that the Prime Minister has a “habit” of bringing up Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress in almost every speech, irrespective of the issue.“It seemed that your political ancestors participated in various movements against the British.

NEW DELHI: A special discussion may have been held on 150 years of Vande Mataram on Monday, but the Bengal assembly elections - scheduled next year - took centre stage as slogans like ""Bihar ki jeet hamari hai, ab Bengal ki baari hai"" were raised by NDA MPs in the Parliament as Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered the House to initiate the debate.During the 10-hour discussion, while the ruling party invoked the Bengal partition and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's legacy, the opposition accused the ruling party of holding the special discussion for its poll prospects in West Bengal.While opening the discussion in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister recalled how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance. Back then, from matchboxes to large ships, ‘Vande Mataram’ was written as a tradition.""It became a means to challenge foreign companies and emerged as a slogan of the Swadeshi movement,” he added.PM Modi also launched a fierce attack on the Congress, accusing the party of repeatedly compromising on the national song — from the freedom movement to the years after Independence.PM Modi said that the Congress convened a session in “Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's Bengal” to review the use of Vande Mataram — a reference to a Congress Working Committee meeting in Kolkata (then Calcutta) in 1937 on the matter.They “partitioned” Vande Mataram in 1937, PM Modi said, speaking in Hindi — “tukde kar diye” — and linked the party's “appeasement politics” to what led to the partition of India in 1947.He described the song as something far deeper than a political chant. “Vande Mataram was not just a mantra for political independence. It was not limited to our independence; it was way beyond that. The freedom movement was a war to free our motherland from the clutches of slavery... During our Vedas, it was said: This land is my mother, and I am the son of the soil.”During the discussion, PM Modi was also interrupted by TMC's Sugata Roy for referring Bankim Chandra Chaterjee as 'Bankim Da' and not 'Bankim Babu.'PM Modi quickly corrected himself and said, “I will say Bankim Babu. Thank you, I respect your sentiments.”“Can I call you dada, or is that also an issue?” he added.Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a broadside against the Bharatiya Janata Party and claimed that the only purpose of the special discussion on the national song was to serve the ruling party with poll prospects in the upcoming West Bengal assembly elections.During her address in the Lok Sabha, Priyanka said that there are two reasons for the debate on the national song in Parliament.“There are two reasons for the debate on Vande Mataram in the House today. Elections are approaching in Bengal. In such a situation, our esteemed Prime Minister wishes to establish his role.”“Those who fought the freedom struggle, who made sacrifices for the country — this government seeks an opportunity to level new accusations against them. By doing so, the Modi government wishes to divert the country’s attention from the essential issues concerning the people,” she added.“You (BJP) are for the elections, we are for the country. No matter how many elections we lose, we will sit here and keep fighting you and your ideology. We will keep fighting for our country. You cannot stop us,” she further said.Trinamool Congress's Kalyan Banerjee also said the way the Prime Minister addressed author Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay was very ""disturbing"".""The debate was started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is really, very sorry to say, it was below standard. The debate was for Vande Mataram, not for attacking Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi,"" he said.""The way he addressed the great author, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, it was really disturbing. Actually, not only Narendra Modi or (home minister) Amit Shah, BJP people are Bengali haters.""They hate them but under compulsion, one has to tolerate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, one has to tolerate the Bengalis' fight for freedom, one has to tolerate Rabindranath Tagore, because India has been enriched by Bengalis. They dislike Bengalis.... I cannot call the prime minister Narendra Modi da, my culture does not allow that...,"" Banerjee added.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also weighed in on the issue and questioned the BJP over its stance on not appreciating freedom fighters.Addressing a press conference in Kolkata, Banerjee said, ""I heard some people from the BJP say that they don't appreciate Netaji. You don't appreciate Netaji, Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Ram Mohan Roy — then who do you appreciate?""The West Bengal assembly election is due in March–April next year. After sweeping the Bihar polls, PM Modi had listed West Bengal as the “next target” in his speech.PM Modi had said that the NDA's massive win in Bihar has set the groundwork for a similar performance in neighbouring West Bengal.""The river Ganga flows to Bengal via Bihar. And the victory in Bihar, like the river, has paved the way for our victory in Bengal,"" PM Modi had said.Mamata Banerjee has been in power since 2011 after defeating the Communist government of multiple decades.The BJP managed to get 77 seats, its highest ever in the state, in the 2021 contest.","PM Modi recalls how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

Who is Saurabh Luthra ?







NEW DELHI: A packed nightclub in North Goa turned into a death trap after a massive fire broke out just after midnight on Sunday, killing 25 people and injuring six. The blaze ripped through Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, triggering panic among visitors and raising serious questions about illegal operations and safety violations.Police initially suspected a cylinder blast, but a tourist who survived claimed fireworks went off during a dance performance and were the likely cause. The deceased included four tourists and 14 staff members, while the identities of seven others were still being confirmed.Chief minister Pramod Sawant vowed strict action against officials who allowed the club to run despite safety violations, and police registered an FIR against the owners under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita.Police have registered an FIR against Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra, the owners of Birch by Romeo Lane, along with the nightclub’s manager and event organisers. The sarpanch of the Arpora–Nagoa panchayat, Roshan Redkar—who had issued a trade licence for the premises in 2013—has also been detained.Redkar said earlier in the day that the club was run by Saurabh Luthra, who had a dispute with his partner. “They had filed a complaint against each other with the panchayat.We had inspected the premises and found that they did not have the permission to construct the club,” he said.According to Saurabh's LinkedIn, he is the chairman of Birch by Romeo Lane, Mama’s Buoi, Romeo Lane, and Being GS Pvt Ltd. He has been active in the food and beverage industry for several years and has expanded his brand Romeo Lane to multiple cities and countries.Official website of Romeo Lane described Saurabh as a gold medalist engineer who became a “promising and fastest-growing restaurateur,” known for organic cocktails and strong public relations.

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision aimed at facilitating the education of a minor girl, Supreme Court on Monday approved issuance of an SC certificate based on the 'Adi Dravida' caste of her mother, who is married to a non-SC person, even though it is yet to adjudicate a bunch of petitions challenging the norm that a child inherits their father's caste.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi refused to entertain a challenge to a Madras HC order directing grant of SC caste certificate to the Puducherry girl on the sole ground that her academic career may suffer without it.""We are keeping the question of law open,"" the bench said. However, what the CJI said next could lead to a big debate. He said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant SC certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son - based on her caste certificate as her husband had stayed at her parents' house since their marriage. In her application, she had contended that her parents and grandparents belonged to Hindu Adi Dravida community.The presidential notifications of Mar 5, 1964, and Feb 17, 2002, read with instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, say that a person's eligibility to get a caste certificate is primarily based on their father's caste as well as his residential status in the state or UT's jurisdiction.In Punit Rai Vs Dinesh Chaudhary [(2003) 8 SCC 204], a case relating to reservation, SC had said that the decisive factor for determination of caste of a person will be the caste of the father as per customary Hindu Law and that in the absence of statutory law, they would inherit their caste from the father and not the mother.In the 2012 judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of SC ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case."" It said, ""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between tribal and non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means is the presumption conclusive or irrebuttable, and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to SC/ST. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which her mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it said.","CJI Surya Kant said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125853517,imgsize-1051879,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-had-earlier-held-fathers-caste-as-decisive-factor.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the treatment meted out to a resident of Arunachal Pradesh transiting through the Shanghai airport, India has sought assurances from Beijing that its citizens will not be selectively harassed.The govt had earlier registered strong protest with China for the detention of the Indian woman, reiterating its position that the north-eastern state is an integral and inalienable part of India and no amount of denial by China would change this reality.“We expect Chinese authorities to provide assurances that Indian citizens transiting through Chinese airports will not be selectively targeted, arbitrarily detained or harassed...” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Regulations governing international air travel would be respected by the Chinese side,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.“MEA would advise Indian nationals to exercise due discretion while travelling to or transiting through China,” he added.Denying that the woman was harassed, the Chinese foreign ministry had earlier said that having border checks on people entering and exiting a country and carrying out law enforcement according to the “specific situation of the entry or exit is the usual practice” of border enforcement authorities of countries across the world.

NEW DELHI: Amid reports of widespread non-compliance of safety norms in sleeper coach buses, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday directed officials to carry out checking of all such buses by govt-approved testing agencies — ARAI, CIRT and iCAT — and ensure compliance.He was chairing a review meeting on the recent bus fires in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh — which killed over 40 people — with top ministry officials. The minister was informed that out of around 60 sleeper buses, registered with RTOs since Sept 1, only a few had got type approval.Type approval of bus bodies is mandatory under the new Bus Body Code, which came into force from Sept. It was also flagged that in several cases registration of buses were renewed even without visiting transport department offices.Officials said taking note of this serious violation, Gadkari sought action against erring bus body builders and also transport department officials for lapses. At present, there are over 37,000 sleeper coach buses in the country and most of these were built in different years. “Though there was a view that ensuring high quality bus body building can be achieved better when bus manufacturers’ build them, it was also felt that such a decision would impact a large number of people engaged by bus body builders.So, the focus is to see that these bus body builders also comply with norms,” said an official.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) last week directed all chief secretaries to take immediate action, including to recall buses flouting mandatory safety norms and carry out rectifications. These include removing the partition between driver and passenger sections, installation of fire detection and suppression systems (FDSS) and stricter checking of accreditation and certification of bus body builders. The commission had termed the violation of motor vehicle rules and automotive standards, laying down mandatory norms for sleeper buses by bus body builders and officials, as “criminal negligence”.The road transport ministry is also working on a plan to prepare a mandatory checklist of safety features that RTOs must verify while renewing registration and fitness certificates when these visit offices.",Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday directed officials to carry out checking of all such buses by govt-approved testing agencies.

NEW DLEHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday held discussion on the country's national song - Vande Mataram ’ - on its 150th anniversary. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla opened the special discussion, calling the national song a powerful symbol of India’s harmony, strength and freedom struggle, and said the debate aims to honour the sacrifices of freedom fighters and pass its legacy to future generations.The debate quickly escalated into a sharp NDA–INDIA bloc face-off, with both sides trading pointed barbs. While the BJP accused the Congress of pursuing a “divisive agenda,” yielding to the Muslim League in the past, and “breaking” the national song, the Congress and its INDIA allies countered that the ruling party was deliberately politicising Vande Mataram ahead of the Bengal elections and using the debate as a distraction from unemployment, inflation and other pressing national concerns.The discussion was opened by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who accused the Congress of disrespecting Vande Mataram and “surrendering before the Muslim League,” while criticising leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi for skipping the discussion on the national song. He said, “Serious discussion is going on in Parliament, but LoP Rahul Gandhi is not present… First Nehru, now Rahul Gandhi, has shown disregard to Vande Mataram.”PM cited historical correspondence between Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose to argue that Congress had once diluted the song under political pressure. He said Nehru had written to Bose that Vande Mataram could “provoke and irritate Muslims,” claiming this amounted to “a betrayal” of the national song.Highlighting its role in the freedom struggle, the Prime Minister described Vande Mataram as a powerful unifying force that revived national consciousness. “Vande Mataram became the voice of our freedom movement… ‘Veer ka abhimaan hai ye shabd Vande Mataram’,” he said, adding that the government aims to “restore its glory” as it marks 150 years. Modi recalled the 1905 partition of Bengal and said “Vande Mataram stood like a rock” against British divide-and-rule tactics.He emphasised that the anniversary offers an opportunity to revive national pride, urging unity across political lines. “This song should inspire and energise us to fulfil the dreams of our freedom fighters… to make our nation self-reliant and developed by 2047,” he said.Opening for opposition Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi accused PM Modi of trying to “rewrite history” during the Vande Mataram debate and said the BJP cannot tarnish Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy. He said, PM repeatedly targets Nehru and the Congress and argued that it was his party that elevated Vande Mataram to the status of national song, noting it was first sung at the 1896 Congress session.Gogoi rejected the PM’s claim that Congress weakened the song, saying it was the Muslim eague that sought a boycott, while Congress leaders stood firm. He accused Modi of politicising the discussion and questioned the BJP’s historical role in the freedom struggle, warning of reviving “divide and rule” politics.SP leader Akhilesh Yadav while speaking criticised the BJP saying, those who did not participate in the freedom struggle were now lecturing on its values and warning that the national song should not be used as a political tool or to impose beliefs on others. He said Vande Mataram should be followed in spirit as it united people during the freedom movement, and accused “divisive elements” of using it to create splits, comparing this to British “divide and rule” tactics. Yadav also alleged that the ruling side tries to appropriate iconic figures and claimed that even if people do not remember the entire song, the words evoke pride because of their deep emotional resonance.BJP MP Anurag Singh Thakur targeted the Congress, asserting that the national song is a “maha mantra” that energises patriots but triggers “allergy” in those who engage in divisive politics. Claiming that objections to the song mirror those once raised by the British and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, he said Congress was “afraid” and needed to “repent its past mistakes,” including the UPA government’s 2006 decision to make singing Vande Mataram voluntary under alleged pressure from “radicalists. ” Thakur also criticised the absence of key opposition leaders, saying those who do not draw strength from Vande Mataram align with “Congress, Communists or the Muslim League.” Calling the song eternal and central to India’s national spirit, he said every Indian should bow to the tricolour and chant Vande Mataram, while Opposition MPs accused the BJP of overlooking the RSS’ own historical reluctance to hoist the national flag.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the BJP of deliberately stoking controversy over Vande Mataram ahead of the 2026 West Bengal elections, alleging the government pushed for a Lok Sabha debate on the national song to divert attention from unemployment, inflation and other public concerns.She said the ruling party was committing a “big sin” by politicising a song that belongs to every Indian, arguing that the BJP was using it to attack Jawaharlal Nehru and rewrite history. She claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “weakening self-confidence” was driving such debates and accused the government of targeting freedom fighters while ignoring present-day issues. Priyanka also defended Nehru’s legacy, countering BJP claims about “fragmentation” of the song, and accused the PM of selectively quoting historical letters to fuel a political narrative.Defence minister Rajnath Singh argued that it is time for an unbiased assessment of Vande Mataram, saying neither the song nor Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s Anandmath were anti-Islam but reflected popular anger against the Nawab of Bengal and British oppression. He said many people know only the first two stanzas and have forgotten the rest, which, according to him, capture the essence of India, and accused some of deliberately rendering the song incomplete. Singh also claimed that the Congress’ politics of appeasement contributed to India’s partition. Explaining the context of Anand Math, he said it depicted the suffering of Bengalis under heavy taxation and famine, adding that the work and the song were “not against any religion or sect” but expressed the people’s protest against injustice.TMC MP Mahua Moitra, accused the BJP of using Vande Mataram as an electoral tool ahead of the 2026 Bengal polls, alleging that the ruling party was “butchering the soul” of the song and acting on “some half-wit BJP IT cell minion’s” political advice. Arguing that the timing of the discussion was aimed at gaining an advantage in Bengal, she said the TMC welcomed it because it would only show “how removed you are from the soul of Bengal. ”She contrasted the ideals in the song’s stanzas with current issues such as water scarcity, pollution, land degradation and alleged hate speech, arguing that the government had failed to uphold the spirit of the national song. Claiming the Centre was ignoring Tagore’s inclusive vision in Jana Gana Mana, she said the debate was meant to deflect from governance failures and challenged the BJP to “come and fight the 2026 Bengal election,” asserting that “ten crore Bengalis will rise to teach you the real meaning of Vande Mataram. ”","The Lok Sabha held discussion on the country's national song - Vande Mataram ’ - on its 150th anniversary.

Texas shake-up: Jasmine Crockett enters Senate battle — is Trump critic the right pick for Democrats?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-shake-up-jasmine-crockett-enters-senate-battle-is-trump-critic-the-right-pick-for-democrats/articleshow/125853616.cms,"VIRAL MOMENT: Tom Homan's DRAMATIC RETALIATION After Student Calls Him 'RACIST, TRAITOR' In Texas

Is she a right choice?









Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett on Monday formally launched her bid for a Texas Senate seat at an event in Dallas, ending months of speculation.She will face state lawmaker James Talarico in the Democratic primary, whose fundraising and faith-first message have turned heads in the party.Crockett announced her Senate campaign at the Dallas event, drawing parallels between her effort and Barack Obama’s upstart 2008 presidential campaign.Her campaign played a video at the event featuring President Trump repeatedly referring to Crockett as a ""low-IQ person.""Her announcement came just hours after Texas Democrat Colin Allred said he was dropping out of the Senate race and would instead run for a US House seat.Democrats are aiming to oust long-serving Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) in next year’s midterms, Axios reported.Her bid came at the time when Court has accepted Texas’ redrawn congressional maps, which leave three Dallas-area House Democrats with just two Democratic-leaning districts to run in.The US Supreme Court last week ruled that Texas may use its new map, which adds five Republican-leaning seats, for the 2026 midterms.Allred said Monday that he would run for the redrawn 33rd congressional district.As soon as her name got locked for the Texas Senate seat, several critics felt that she’s made what was already a difficult task even harder.Crockett heads into the primary as a strong favorite, bolstered by national name recognition and firm progressive bona fides — assets that could give her an edge over Talarico in the Democratic race. But those same strengths may prove trickier in a general election, where Democrats will have to win over a much wider swath of Texas voters, NBC reported.Republican Senator John Cornyn’s campaign released a video on the social media platform X over the weekend attacking Representative Jasmine Crockett’s record and urging her to run for the US Senate.Republicans have already been goading her to run, viewing her as a manageable opponent in a general election.Cornyn had posted “Run Jasmine, run!” on X back in July. His campaign’s weekend video opened with a narrator saying, “From open borders to socialist economics to unhinged attacks on anyone who disagrees, Jasmine Crockett isn’t representing Texas. She’s representing the far-left fringe.”The video highlighted some of Crockett’s controversial comments, including saying that “it is not a criminal violation to enter the country illegally”; labelling GOP Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Gov. Hot Wheels”; and criticising Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., as a “bleach blonde bad built butch body.”On Monday, responding to news that Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett was entering the GOP nomination race for the U.S. Senate, Cornyn called her “radical, theatrical and ineffective.”“As the GOP nominee for US Senate, our campaign will make sure every Texas voter knows how absurd her candidacy is, and in the process provide up-ballot support to down-ballot Republicans, including the five new congressional seats that President Trump has made a priority,” Cornyn said, referring to the redrawn House seats.Cornyn told reporters that he did not have a preference for a Democratic opponent, saying of Crockett and her rival, Marc Talarico, “I think both of them are flawed candidates, and so I’d be happy to run against either one of them.”Attorney General Ken Paxton also released a statement dubbing the congresswoman “Crazy Jasmine Crockett” and predicting she would lose a general election.“The announcement is likely extremely upsetting for John Cornyn, who counts Jasmine Crockett as one of his best friends,” Paxton said. “Cornyn even went so far as to call Jasmine Crockett his ‘dance partner,’” Paxton added, referring to Cornyn’s comments last year to the Texas Tribune about working with Crockett on legislation.Crockett has said her campaign has conducted polling showing her in a strong position. “The data says that I can win,” Crockett said in an MS NOW interview after the Thanksgiving holiday, saying she can build a coalition of “Black and brown” voters.","Representative Jasmine Crockett formally launched her bid for a Texas Senate seat at an event in Dallas.

Claims of a disturbing message prompt scrutiny over loyalty and silence

Who Stood To Benefit From Charlie Kirk's Assassination? | Candace Ep 276





Allegations surrounding the reported final hours of political commentator Charlie Kirk have sparked a storm of speculation, and Candace Owens is at the center of it. On her show, she claimed that multiple people connected to Turning Point USA (TPUSA) were aware that Kirk believed he was in danger before he died.The statement has unsettled supporters and critics alike, not only because of the seriousness of the claim, but because of the silence Owens says has followed it. As the public awaits answers, her comments have ignited a wider discussion about loyalty, money, and secrecy in powerful political circles.Owens stated that the information was passed to her by someone inside TPUSA and involved a late-night warning Kirk allegedly sent the night before his death. “What I can tell you is we also received a tip from somebody within Turning Point USA that the night before he died, I know for a fact, he messaged a donor and he messaged somebody at Turning Point USA.”She then revealed the most shocking part of the tip: “But I did not know, and this is what was told to me, that he also messaged Dan Flood, the security that's to his right, and allegedly, explicitly said that they are going to kill me tomorrow.”Owens emphasized that several people, including a donor and TPUSA members, allegedly knew Kirk feared he would be murdered. Yet, according to her, none of them have stepped forward with public statements. She challenged this silence, calling it a “massive question mark” and questioning whether fear, loyalty, or money is keeping people quiet.Her closing words suggested that the root of the silence may run deeper than personal loyalty. “And what we can say for certain is, of course, people will betray one another if money is on the line. It could be for 30 pieces of silver, or it could be for billions. But things get complicated when there's a lot of money on the line.”As the mystery deepens, Owens’ claims have placed TPUSA under intense scrutiny and the public is demanding answers that no one has yet been willing to give.Also Read: Candace Owens reignites explosive France controversy after reposting viral “terrorist state” claim","Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk warned of his impending death to a donor and TPUSA staff the night before he died.

Jennifer Welch reacts to Erika Kirk’s New York comments and views on women





Podcaster Jennifer Welch strongly criticized Erika Kirk, the widow of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk , during the December 7 episode of the I’ve Had It podcast. Welch accused Erika Kirk of being “an absolute grifter” and compared her to Donald Trump. She also called Charlie Kirk racist and homophobic, using direct and blunt language that quickly caught public attention.Welch made the comments while speaking with her co-host Angie “Pumps” Sullivan. The discussion focused on Erika Kirk’s recent remarks about women in New York City and their voting choices.

While speaking to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Erika Kirk said it was “ironic” that most of New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s supporters were women.Erika Kirk said:“It’s so ironic and so interesting that a heavy percentage of the individuals that voted for him were female.”She also talked about women living in cities like Manhattan, suggesting they rely too much on the government instead of building families.She said:“What I don’t want to have happen is women, young women, in the city look to the government as a solution. To put off having a family or a marriage, because you’re relying on the government to support you.”Jennifer Welch responded strongly to those remarks on her podcast. She accused Erika Kirk of using her gender to attack other women and questioned her values.Jennifer Welch said:“You are an opportunistic grifter who weaponizes your gender to demean women.”She also spoke about Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, who was shot and killed in September while speaking at Utah Valley University.Jennifer Welch added:“Your deceased husband was an unrepentant racist and a homophobe.”Angie Sullivan agreed with Welch and said there is more to life than only being a wife or a mother.

Bhavana Menon on facing sexual assault: 'I was devastated, my dignity was shredded to a million pieces'

KOCHI: A Kerala sessions court acquitted Monday Malayalam film star Dileep in the 2017 abduction and gang-rape of a fellow actor, ruling that prosecutors failed to prove he conspired to orchestrate the crime. The six-member gang that carried out the assault, led by Sunil NS alias Pulsar Suni, was convicted of gang rape and other serious charges. Sentencing for the convicted is scheduled for Dec 12.Dileep, charged by police as the alleged mastermind, was cleared of conspiracy, gang rape, destruction of evidence and IT Act violations. GSarath, a friend, added later in the probe, was acquitted of evidence-tampering charges. Two others accused of aiding the crime were also cleared.Judge Honey M Varghese delivered the verdict before a packed courtroom. “Considering the gravity of the offences against a woman, the convicted are not entitled to the benefit of probation,” the court said while remanding them in custody.The convicted include Suni, Martin Antony, Manikandan B, Vijeesh VP, Salim H and Pradeep. They were found guilty of criminal conspiracy, wrongful confinement, sexual assault, disrobing, attempt to confine, gang rape under the Indian Penal Code, and violations of the Information Technology Act for recording and publishing sexually explicit material.Prosecutors said the survivor, a popular film actor, was travelling from Thrissur to Kochi on the night of Feb 17, 2017, when her car was allegedly tracked by the gang using location updates supplied by Martin Antony. Near Athani, the gang staged a fake road accident, forced their way into the car, abducted her and drove to an isolated area in Kochi. Police said Suni threatened the survivor, sexually assaulted her and secretly recorded the attack on a mobile phone.Dileep was arrested five months later, in July 2017, after investigators alleged he had hired the gang over a personal grudge linked to his estranged relationship with ex-wife Manju Warrier. The court ruled that the alleged conspiracy was not established beyond doubt.","Dileep cleared of conspiracy, gang rape, destruction of evidence and IT Act violations.

Till garnish do us part: Ahmedabad couple’s onion-garlic spat ends in divorce; wife’s appeal dismissed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/till-garnish-do-us-part-couples-onion-garlic-spat-ends-in-divorce/articleshow/125844902.cms,"AI Image

AHMEDABAD: Onion and garlic caused such a pungent discord between an Ahmedabad couple that the husband filed for divorce, finding the wife's gastronomical restrictions to be unpalatable. Now, the Gujarat high court has dismissed the wife's appeal challenging the dissolution of the marriage.The wife, an adherent of the Swaminarayan sect, strictly refrained from eating onion and garlic. The beliefs of her husband and in-laws set no such dietary prohibition.The couple married in 2002 but the cuisine choices were a recipe for disaster, as the metaphorical knives were soon out, endangering the marital knot.The wife regularly attended prayers and heeded the sect's proscription of onion and garlic. Her husband and mother-in-law did not want to alter their culinary habits. This resulted in separate cooking arrangements.The divided kitchen soon chopped the matrimonial tie and the wife left her matrimonial home with the couple's child.In 2013, the husband filed a divorce petition in Ahmedabad's family court, alleging cruelty and desertion by the wife.On May 8, 2024, the family court dissolved the marriage and ordered the husband to pay maintenance.This brought both to the high court, with the man questioning the maintenance order and the woman challenging the divorce while also seeking the implementation of the maintenance order.The wife's lawyer submitted to the high court that the case put forth by her husband in the family court was that her culinary preferences governed by her faith resulted in altercations. She was behaving in a rigid manner, the husband told the family court, which accepted his claims.The husband's counsel argued that his client and his mother used to cook food free of onion and garlic for the wife.""The consumption of onion and garlic was the trigger point of the differences between the parties,"" the husband told the high court. He said that he had to approach the Gujarat State Legal Services Authority because of his wife's ""rigidity"" and had filed an application with the Mahila Police Station because of her ""torture and harassment"".After a point, the woman told the high court that she did not have any problem with the dissolution of the marriage.

Want to drink in Saudi Arabia? Non-Muslim foreign residents can now enjoy alcohol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/want-to-drink-in-saudi-arabia-non-muslim-foreign-residents-can-now-enjoy-alcohol-but-there-is-one-condition/articleshow/125859993.cms,"Cheers, if you can afford it.





Saudi Arabia is finally uncorking the bottle for non-Muslim foreign residents — but there’s a catch, and it goes straight for your wallet.Now, the non-Muslim foreigners can enjoy alcohol, but only if they earn enough money to qualify.According to the Quran, people practicing Muslim should abstain from consuming alcohol and other drugs. And since, Saudi Arabia is a Muslim nation, most of the laws were shaped according to the Quran. Though many like a countrywide ban on women driving have been reversed in recent years.Now, non-Muslim foreign residents will be able to purchase alcohol in Saudi Arabia — but only if they make more than 50,000 riyals, or roughly $13,300, per month, sources familiar with the shift told Bloomberg.For Saudi authorities, the motivations for expanding alcohol sales are clear. The kingdom is seeking more highly educated foreigners, hosting the men’s soccer World Cup in 2034 and under pressure to boost tourism and non-oil revenue as part of its economic diversification plan.“They can’t have missed that alcohol sales and associated taxes are a huge moneymaker for neighbouring Dubai,” said Leber.Despite vast oil wealth, Saudi Arabia faces a budget crunch and expected fiscal deficits in coming years. While officials appear to be moving cautiously to avoid backlash from conservative Saudis, years of political crackdown have left few dissenters willing to speak out. The recent expansion of alcohol sales has received no coverage in local media and no comment from the grand mufti, the kingdom’s official religious leader.","Non-Muslim foreign residents will be able to purchase alcohol in Saudi Arabia.

Goa Club Fire Exposed Deadly Design Errors, Trapping Dozens As Only One Exit Functioned

GOA: The tragic deaths of 25 people at Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub at northern Goa’s Arpora on Saturday night could have been avoided if top IPS officers, serving and retired, posted in Goa had allowed local police to act as per the law, according to a senior local cop aware of the investigation.Two local police units, Anjuna police station and crime branch, had issued notices to the club owners to submit the documents and permissions that allowed him to operate. However, senior IPS officers stopped the units from pursuing these notices, the officer told TOI.These officers even pressured local police to close an FIR registered against Birch by Romeo Lane in connection with loud music, he said.During 2024 Lok Sabha elections, then Anjuna police inspector Prashal Desai was the first to seek information from the nightclub about the permissions issued to them by the authorities, but a top IPS officer, now retired from service, stopped local police from pursuing the issue.Within two months, crimebranch DSP Rajesh Kumar issued another notice to the club that said he had been informed about violations by the club, and that they should visit the crime branch office in person with all permissions to operate that they had received from the authorities. Kumar, too, was stopped by the same IPS officer.Then, in Aug last year, Anjuna PI Paresh Naik registered FIRs against five nightclubs in Anjuna area for allegedly playing loud music.The case was investigated by then DSP (Mapusa) Sandesh Chodankar.A senior IPS officer told Chodankar not to confront the owners of Birch by Romeo Lane, while another officer pressured him to file a closure report.The officer, who is aware of the investigation, said if call records of all IPS officers — serving and those who served in Goa — are obtained, one can directly link them to the Birch owners.On Sunday, state revenue minister Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate raised the issue of whether govt would have suspended IAS and IPS officers involved in any wrongdoing in the state the way it acted against Goa cadre officers. His comments came after state govt suspended three govt officials — former director of panchayats Siddhi Halarnkar, former member-secretary of Goa state pollution control board Shamila Monteiro, and former secretary of ArporaNagoa village panchayat Reghuvir Bagkar — in the wake of Saturday’s inferno.","Top IPS officers, serving and retired, posted in Goa had allowed local police to act as per the law, according to a senior local cop aware of the investigation.

WhistlinDiesel claims gag order blocks him from talking about his case





WhistlinDiesel has claimed that Tennessee state officials are trying to stop him from speaking publicly after his arrest for tax evasion. The popular YouTuber, whose real name is Cody Detwiler, shared the accusation in a video posted earlier this week. He told his millions of followers that the issue began after his November arrest at his home in Tennessee and has now turned into what he believes is an attempt to mute him online.Cody Detwiler said he was shocked by both the arrest and the rules that followed. He explained that he had no idea there was a tax issue until officers arrived. He also said that after reviewing court papers, he now believes the state is trying to limit what he can share while the case moves forward.In his latest video, WhistlinDiesel explained that a court motion filed by Tennessee prosecutors includes what he describes as a gag order.He said the document stops him from making any pre-trial statements about the case across social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and X.“They don’t want me talking at all,” he said in the video. “They’re saying my reach could affect the case.” According to WhistlinDiesel, the filing points to his massive online audience, noting that he has more than 20 million followers across platforms.Prosecutors allegedly argued that his comments could influence potential jurors and hurt the state’s case. The court motion also mentioned his merchandise, which includes images of the public indictment page released after his arrest.WhistlinDiesel pushed back on the claims. He told viewers he has never threatened anyone connected to the case and asked his audience not to harass or target any officials.“I don’t want anyone going after these people,” he said. “This is between me and the state.”The YouTuber also shared parts of an investigative report that outlined how the case was built.He said state officials contacted more than a dozen people and businesses linked to his Ferrari F8, including his accountant. WhistlinDiesel claimed his accountant was advised not to inform him while the investigation was ongoing.WhistlinDiesel stated that the charge centers on unpaid sales tax tied to the Ferrari, a car that later burned down.He said he never received a tax bill or warning before the arrest and only learned the full details after receiving the investigative report about two weeks later.The case is still active, and court proceedings are expected to continue in Tennessee. For now, WhistlinDiesel says he is sharing what he legally can, while questioning why he believes the state is trying to keep him quiet as the legal process plays out.Also Read: Top 5 IShowSpeed Viral Moments In 2025 That Made Him Streamer Of The Year","WhistlinDiesel claims gag order blocks him from talking about his case on social media.

Eugenia Cooney’s appearance brings back long-standing health concerns





Influencer Eugenia Cooney has been seen back in Florida, and the sighting has once again raised serious concern among her fans. Cooney was spotted on Sunday at Orlando International Airport, marking her first public appearance in more than a month. This moment quickly caught attention because she has stayed away from social media since June and has not been seen much in public since an October trip to Disney World, according to TMZ.People who saw Cooney at the airport said she looked extremely thin. As pictures began to spread online, fans shared worried messages and asked if she was doing okay. Many said the sight was upsetting because Cooney has a long history of health struggles that she has spoken about in the past. An eyewitness spoke to TMZ and described the scene at the airport. The source said Cooney kept to herself and did not draw attention. She was sitting near baggage claim with her brother after landing on a JetBlue flight from New York City. Their mother was with them as well.The eyewitness told TMZ, “Eugenia Cooney kept it low-key as she sat with her brother near baggage claim. The siblings had just exited a JetBlue flight from NYC with their mom, who was seen grabbing their luggage for them.”The source also said that neither Cooney nor her brother helped their mother carry the bags. This quiet moment quickly turned into a big talking point after photos from the airport surfaced online.In the photos, Eugenia Cooney was dressed in her usual fashion style. She wore ripped jeans, an oversized purple sweatshirt, dark sunglasses, and carried a Mickey Mouse purse over her shoulder. While some fans commented on her outfit, most focused on how thin she looked.Eugenia Cooney has been open about her struggles before. In 2019, she confirmed that she had an eating disorder. She also shared that friends once placed her on a psychiatric hold because they were worried about her health. Cooney later said that experience made her feel hurt and betrayed by people close to her.Fans have continued to express concern for years. The worry grew stronger during a May livestream, when many viewers felt she looked unwell and seemed to be getting sick on camera.The situation even reached local authorities. In October, the Greenwich Police Department in Connecticut told TMZ that there had been an increase in calls during the summer related to concerns about Cooney’s health. Police also said that it had been several months since the last call.As of now, Eugenia Cooney has not commented on the airport sighting.

An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans.

A powerful magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck in a remote area near the border between Alaska and the Canadian territory of Yukon on Saturday.There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury, AP news agency reported.The U.S. Geological Survey said it struck about 230 miles (370 kilometres) northwest of Juneau, Alaska, and 155 miles (250 kilometres) west of Whitehorse, Yukon.In Whitehorse, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Calista MacLeod said the detachment received two 911 calls about the quake. “It definitely was felt,” MacLeod said. “There are a lot of people on social media, people felt it.”Alison Bird, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada, said the part of Yukon most affected by the temblor is mountainous and has few people. “Mostly people have reported things falling off shelves and walls,” Bird said. “It doesn’t seem like we’ve seen anything in terms of structural damage.”The Canadian community nearest to the epicentre is Haines Junction, about 80 miles (130 kilometres) away, Bird said. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics listed its population at 1,018 for 2022. The quake was also about 56 miles (91 kilometres) from Yakutat, Alaska, which the USGS said has 662 residents.It struck at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometres) and was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks.","There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

Courtroom bombshell: Bodycam shows police find loaded magazine hidden in wet underwear in Luigi Mangione’s bag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/courtroom-bombshell-bodycam-shows-police-find-loaded-magazine-hidden-in-wet-underwear-in-luigi-mangiones-bag/articleshow/125854221.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





Luigi Mangione pumped his fist in court on Monday as body-camera footage allegedly showed officers finding a loaded magazine tucked inside wet underwear in the suspect’s backpack.The video was aired during day 5 of the hearings at Manhattan Criminal Court to decide whether some evidence should be excluded from his trial.Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. He returned to court on Monday morning for the suppression hearing.Body-camera footage showed Altoona, Pennsylvania, Police Officer Christy Wasser searching Mangione’s backpack at the time of his arrest and discovering a magazine with bullets wrapped in wet underwear. “There was another magazine hidden in his underwear,” Wasser can be heard saying, Fox News reported.As Wasser held up the magazine, someone off camera said “it’s fu****g him.” Wasser testified that she had gone to the McDonald’s in Altoona on her own to assist Officer Joseph Detwiler. She began searching the bag after Mangione was placed under arrest and invoked his right to remain silent when officers asked if there was anything inside that they should be worried about.Wasser said that his silence heightened her concern and led her to search for a bomb, although she did not order restaurant staff or patrons out of the area.Her search uncovered the magazine, and she said she was then instructed to finish and return to the station. She told the court that two fellow officers debated whether a warrant was needed or if probable cause existed to continue the search.Mangione was arrested at the McDonald’s on December 9-2024 after an employee recognised him and alerted police. He faces multiple state and federal charges related to the alleged murder.His lawyers are asking the judge to suppress evidence taken from his backpack and statements he made to police at the time of arrest. They argued Fourth and Fifth Amendment concerns, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures and ensure the right to due process. Prosecutors contend that the warrantless search was lawful and that Mangione’s only un-Mirandized statement was giving officers a fake name.Last week, prosecutors released the 911 call that led to Mangione’s arrest. “I’m a manager at Plank Road McDonald’s out here on the boulevard,” a manager told the dispatcher. “And I have a customer here, that some other customers were suspicious of, that he looks like the CEO shooter from New York.”",Luigi Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.

Who are Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal? Afghan asylum seekers jailed for raping 15-year-old girl in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-are-jan-jahanzeb-and-israr-niazal-afghan-asylum-seekers-jailed-for-raping-15-year-old-girl-in-britain/articleshow/125846927.cms,"



Two Afghan asylum seekers who arrived in Britain on small boats have been jailed for raping a 15-year-old girl in Leamington Spa after dragging her into a dark park.Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal, both 17, lured the teenager away from her friends on May 10 before forcing her to perform oral sex in a secluded area, reports the Daily Mail. The girl screamed for help and filmed harrowing footage on her phone as she was led away, the clip was played in Warwick Crown Court.Judge Sylvia de Bertodano sentenced Jahanzeb to 10 years and eight months and Niazal to nine years and 10 months, noting the younger boy’s age at the time of the offence.“No child should have to suffer the ordeal (the victim) has suffered. The fact is, you two have robbed her of her childhood and nothing that the sentence of this court and nothing I can do today can restore that,” the judge said.She added: “You have betrayed the interests of those, like you, who come here fleeing harm and seeking safety and for that you should feel a deep and lasting sense of shame.”CCTV released after sentencing showed the boys leading the victim across a bridge at 9.21pm, flanking her on either side. At one point Jahanzeb covered her mouth as she screamed. The girl later escaped and recorded further videos describing her ordeal before a passerby took her to a police station.Prosecutor Shawn Williams said: “The evidence of lack of consent is overwhelming. The facts reveal a deeply distressing and predatory sexual offence on a vulnerable and highly intoxicated 15-year-old.”In her victim impact statement, the girl said: “The day I was raped changed me as a person. I'm no longer a happy, care-free teenager. This was my first sexual experience. When I go out, I no longer feel safe, so much so that I have started to avoid it all together.”According to the court, Jahanzeb had crossed the Channel in January after three failed attempts, while Niazal arrived in November 2024. Both were living in taxpayer-funded housing at the time of the attack. Jahanzeb now faces deportation, though Niazal may remain in the UK because he pleaded guilty a day before turning 17.Defence lawyers tried to keep the teenagers anonymous, claiming the footage was so gruesome it could trigger public disorder. The judge rejected those arguments and said the public interest in identifying them was greater.","Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal, both 17, lured the teenager away from her friends before forcing her to perform oral sex in a secluded area.

Alina Habba, former personal attorney to US President Donald Trump, has resigned as acting US attorney for New Jersey after a federal appeals court ruled that she had been serving unlawfully.Habba announced her resignation via X, saying she stepped down “to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love.”She added: “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling by US District Judge Matthew Brann, who had found that the Trump administration violated federal appointments law when naming Habba as acting US attorney. Brann disqualified her from participating in ongoing cases, creating a legal standoff that delayed proceedings in New Jersey’s federal courts.Habba’s departure is the latest setback for Trump and his Justice Department as they attempt to place loyalists in key US attorney positions. Her appointment had been challenged by multiple criminal defendants, and her limited federal court experience, along with opposition from New Jersey’s Democratic senators, made Senate confirmation unlikely.Attorney General Pam Bondi also announced her resignation on X and described Habba’s resignation as “particularly unfortunate” and blamed the court for making her position “untenable.” Bondi praised Habba’s work and said her contributions to reducing crime in Camden and Newark are notable. Bondi confirmed that Habba would remain in the Justice Department as a senior adviser to the attorney general. Bondi also said the department would continue to appeal the court ruling and were positive that Habba could return to her role if the decision is reversed.41-year-old Habba had gained national attention as one of Trump’s strongest legal defenders, frequently appearing on television and representing him in high-profile cases. She was appointed acting US attorney in March and served a temporary term enforcing federal criminal and civil law. Her resignation follows months of controversy over the legality of her appointment and her role in overseeing prosecutions.Her exit raises questions about the GOP administration’s approach to installing loyalists in key Justice Department positions. Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused judges of bias in similar cases involving other Trump-appointed prosecutors and vowed to continue legal challenges to restore their appointments.","Alina Habba, former personal attorney to US President Donald Trump, has resigned as acting US attorney for New Jersey.
