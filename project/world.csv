Father of accused claims false arrest

Cops yet to do facial analysis test

NEW DELHI: The simple case of 'burglary gone wrong' at actor Saif Ali Khan 's residence in which he was injured continues to raise questions with the arrest of a Bangladeshi national and medical report from the hospital.The actor, who was discharged three days ago after undergoing surgery at Lilavati Hospital, gave his statement to the police. Meanwhile, opposition leaders in Maharashtra have jumped in, raising questions regarding the attack and the arrest. The father of the accused has also termed it a ""false"" arrest.On Thursday, Bandra police took Saif's statement regarding the violent encounter with an intruder at his 11th-floor residence in Satguru Sharan. The actor said, ""My grip loosened after the stranger stabbed me repeatedly on my back with a knife after I overpowered him.""According to Saif, his household members and staff were terrified when they spotted the armed trespasser. He immediately moved to confront the intruder to safeguard his younger son Jehangir and the staff. In his statement, Saif mentioned that he and Kareena were in their bedroom, and Taimur was in another room with a nurse. Their younger son Jehangir was in a different bedroom with staff nurse Eliyamma Phillip and a domestic helper when Phillip spotted the intruder.A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16. The actor suffered five distinct wounds on his back, wrist, neck, shoulder, and elbow.The report highlighted:The question raised on the day of the attack remains a mystery as different versions come up. Initially, it was reported that there were no drivers available at that hour at Saif's residence and no car was ready. He was taken to the hospital by his younger son Ibrahim in an auto.The auto driver who transported Saif to Lilavati Hospital, approximately 2 km from the actor's residence at Satguru Sharan building in Bandra, mentioned that the actor was with a ""small child"", presumably his seven-year-old son Taimur, along with another individual.The driver, who works night shifts in the Bandra-Khar area, said he spotted one of the actor's domestic help waving at him near Satguru Sharan. ""It was a scene of panic. The actor sat inside, his son in the middle and (Hari) on the side before we left for the hospital,"" he recalled, describing how a blood-soaked Khan struggled to walk. Upon reaching the hospital, the staff immediately attended to him and took him on a stretcher.The neurosurgeon who operated on Saif also said that the actor arrived at the hospital in an auto with his seven-year-old son, Taimur Ali Khan , and a caretaker. ""I was the first one to meet Saif Ali Khan when he came to the hospital. He was drenched in blood, but he walked in like a lion with his small child, Taimur. Saif Ali Khan is a real hero,"" the doctor had said.However, the medical report sent to Bandra Police indicated that Saif was probably taken to the hospital by Afsar Zaidi, his manager and close associate who operates a celebrity management firm.According to the report, Zaidi accompanied Saif to the hospital on January 16 with the admission process completed at 4.11 am.The medical documentation from Lilavati Hospital submitted to the police listed Zaidi's name in the section designated for friends.The medical form has also led to many questioning an alleged 'delay' in Saif reaching the hospital. According to the medical report, the time of the attack was 2.30 am. The actor was, however, admitted to the hospital at 4.11 am.Saif Ali Khan 's home is just 2.3 km (10-15 minutes) away from the hospital.Md Ruhul Amin, father of accused Shariful Islam Sajjad , asserted his son's innocence and appealed to Indian authorities for his immediate release and claimed the photo in the CCTV released by police did not match his son.Shariful Islam hails from Rajabaria village in Jhalakathi, a southern Bangladeshi district located over 200 km away from Dhaka.""I have come to know through various YouTube channels and journalists via telephone that my 30-year-old son Shariful Islam Sajjad has been arrested in India for assaulting actor Saif Ali Khan,"" Md Ruhul Amin told ANI.""My son was arrested on suspicion because of his resemblance to the person involved in the attacks. My son is innocent,"" he added.Md Ruhul Amin expressed his intention to seek assistance from the Bangladesh government through diplomatic channels.""I will go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh after 3 or 4 days and request the Bangladesh government to take diplomatic initiative to free my son,"" he said.A day after Maharashtra cabinet minister and BJP leader Nitesh Rane stirred controversy as he questioned if Saif was assaulted or if the attack was staged, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said the arrested person and the one in the CCTV footage were not the same.""The attack on Saif Ali Khan, it has been stated that the person shown in the CCTV footage and the person who has been arrested are different. I have also seen the photos and they are not the same. The police need to clarify this immediately,"" he said.The police said forensic analysis confirmed that Fakir was linked to the crime. Fingerprints found at multiple locations inside the actor’s flat match those of Fakir.The police, however, while seeking an extension of his custody, told the court that it is yet to conduct a facial recognition test to ascertain if he was the same as the person seen on CCTV footage.The police also need to match the suspect’s footprints to those found at the crime scene and recover the shoes Fakir wore during the attack and the missing portion of the knife used.","A medical report from Lilavati Hospital disclosed details of the injuries Saif sustained during the break-in on January 16.

A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh lambasted the man, saying, ""What kind of a man are you if you don’t even care for your minor daughters? What wrong have they done in coming to this world?""Visibly irked, the bench added, ""He was only interested in having multiple children. We cannot allow such a cruel man to enter our court at all. Sara din ghar pe kabhi Saraswati Puja aur kabhi Lakshmi Puja, aur phir yeh sab (you worship Goddess Saraswati and Lakshmi all day, and then do such things).”Anguished by the case's details, the court demanded that the man pay maintenance or transfer agricultural land to his estranged wife and daughters before it considers passing any favorable orders. ""What is the difference between an animal and a man who does not take care of minor daughters?"" the bench remarked, according to news agency PTI.The man, a Jharkhand resident, was convicted in 2015 for torturing and harassing his wife over dowry demands, under Section 498A of the IPC. He was accused of fraudulently having his wife’s uterus removed, abandoning her and their daughters, and marrying another woman.The case, registered in 2009, led to his conviction, sentencing him to 2.5 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹5,000. He served 11 months in custody.

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai police on Friday informed the local court that it is yet to conduct facial recognition analysis of Shareeful Islam Shehzad Mohammad Rohilla Amin Fakir, a Bangladeshi national arrested for allegedly stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. The facial analysis will be done to ascertain if he was the person seen in the CCTV footage from the actor's building in Bandra.The 30-year-old accused was presented before Magistrate KC Rajput, who extended his police custody until January 29. Fakir was held on January 19 for allegedly breaking into Saif’s apartment with the intent of theft and stabbing the actor multiple times during the incident.Prosecutors KS Patil and Prasad Joshi argued in court that while progress had been made, further investigation was required. Police highlighted key objectives, including:The court was also informed of the recovery of Fakir’s Bangladeshi driving license, which corroborates his origins. Authorities further revealed that Fakir used forged Aadhaar and PAN cards under the alias “Vijay Das” to stay in India.Fakir’s lawyers, Dinesh Prajapati and Sandeep Sherkahne, however, opposed the police's plea, questioning the credibility of the case. They argued that the alleged victim (Khan) had enough time but did not call the police for help.Meanwhile, the accused’s father has contested Fakir’s arrest, claiming that the man seen in the CCTV footage does not match his son. This dispute over identity has deepened the mystery surrounding the case.On January 16, Saif Ali Khan was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder at his 12th-floor apartment in Bandra during the early hours of the morning.

KOLKATA: Father of Shariful Fakir, the illegal Bangladeshi immigrant arrested by Mumbai police for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary attempt at his Bandra home, claimed that police have framed his son. He said Shariful is not the person shown in the video from the initial CCTV footage released the day after the attack.""They have arrested my son as a suspect, but he is not the one whose photograph police had released after the incident. The man in the photograph had long hair that touched his eyes. My son has always had shorter hair raised upwards. They have picked him up as he has some similarities. He is also an easy target as he had entered India illegally,"" Md Rohul Amin, 55, told TOI over a WhatsApp call from Bangladesh.Amin, who is also a village-level Bangladesh Nationalist Party functionary, said he is speaking to senior politicians in his country to raise the ""false arrest"" of his son as a diplomatic issue. Shariful is the second among Rohul's three sons. While his elder son works at a private firm in Dhaka, the younger son is still in school. Shariful dropped out from school after Class 10 and started doing odd jobs after Rohul lost his job at Khulna jute mill.""We may be poor, but we are not criminals. In Bangladesh, he used to ride a bike taxi for a living. But during the era of Awami League, there was a lot of political turmoil in our village and after Sheikh Hasina's govt came back to power early last year. Since my son was an active supporter of Khaleda Zia, he faced immense backlash and so he decided to leave Bangladesh for better earning and living prospects,"" said Rohul.He said Shariful got in touch with an agent who helped him illegally cross the border and enter India in April last year. While Mumbai police said he crossed Dawki river to reach Meghalaya and then reach Bengal via Assam, his father couldn't specify the details. ""He hadn't shared with us about how he had exactly entered India but there are multiple persons like him who leave Bangladesh and head for India illegally for work. Once he reached India, he went to Bengal and worked at a restaurant for a few days, before he went to Mumbai and started working at a bar. He had also met a relative of ours in Bengal but he refused him accommodation,"" said Rohul, who now works as a farmer at Rajabaria village in Jhalokhathi of Bangladesh.Rohul said Friday evening, more than 38 hours since the stabbing incident at Saif's Bandra residence, Shariful called home and told his father that he had transferred 10,000 Bangladeshi taka via a hawala agent leaving only 3,000 taka for himself. ""We know he had done several illegal things, like straying into India and sending money illegally. He may have some politically-motivated cases against him in Bangladesh but one thing I can assure is that my son is not a criminal. He can never loot or attack someone. We demand justice,"" he said, breaking down into tears.",Shariful Fakir's father claims his son was wrongfully arrested for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan.

As they are no longer in politics, this is a chance to drop Washington completely, she said.

They got married in 1992 and had their first daughter Malia in 2998, and second daughter Sasha in 2001.Barack Obama appeared solo at Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration.

Melania's hat stops Donald Trump kissing her at inauguration ceremony

The millinery, more than any other element of Melania Trump ’s inauguration ensemble, captured attention and sparked conversation. The wide-brim navy hat obscured much of her face, giving her an aura of inaccessibility and mystery.As Professor Nichola Gutgold, author of Electing Madam Vice President: When Women Run, Women Win, remarked in an email to CNN, “(With) her face half hidden by her hat, Melania remains aloof.” This air of detachment, coupled with the ensemble’s structured elements, conveyed a subtle defensiveness and a slight combative edge—an aesthetic that has become emblematic of Trump’s style evolution.During her first term as the first lady, from 2017 to 2021, Melania Trump’s fashion choices gradually transitioned toward a more armored and strategic style. Initially soft and nostalgic—recall her Jackie Kennedy-inspired baby-blue Ralph Lauren ensemble at her first inauguration—her wardrobe evolved into one characterized by structured silhouettes and military-inspired detailing. Khaki dresses, sharply tailored navy suits, and outfits in muted grays became staples. These choices featured cinched waists, hard shoulders, and longer hemlines, evoking an image of restraint, power, and control.This shift was no accident. According to Kate Bennett, a former CNN White House correspondent and author of Free, Melania: The Unauthorised Biography, Trump’s clothing choices mirrored her guarded public persona . “Her silhouettes became long-sleeved, cinched waists, hard shoulders, longer hemlines, like almost a military-esque vibe,” Bennett noted. “I think that’s because it felt like armor … because she underwent four years of really intense scrutiny.”The scrutiny was indeed unparalleled. As the spouse of one of the most polarizing political figures in modern history, Melania Trump often found herself the subject of public and media examination, her every word, action, and outfit dissected. Unlike past first ladies who leaned into relatability or accessibility to counteract such pressures, Trump seemed to respond by retreating further into a private cocoon, using fashion as a literal and metaphorical barrier.Her hat at the 2025 inauguration epitomized this strategy. It recalled the other iconic broad-brimmed hat she wore during the state visit of French President Emmanuel Macron in 2018—a piece that also conveyed control and authority while maintaining an air of elegance. The choice of such millinery, both then and now, underscores her preference for styles that create boundaries between herself and the public.This intentional use of fashion as a form of armor aligns with the broader themes of her public life: elusive, impenetrable, and unwaveringly private. While her outfits may adhere to the highest standards of craftsmanship, they resist offering any real insight into her thoughts or emotions. Instead, they reinforce the idea that Melania Trump is a figure meant to be observed, not fully known—a paradoxical blend of visibility and concealment.By the time of her husband’s second inauguration, her style had cemented itself as a deliberate form of self-presentation. Each tailored coat, each structured dress, and each sweeping hat spoke volumes—not about who she is, but about the image she wished to project. Detached yet formidable, she continues to redefine the role of first lady, using sartorial choices to navigate public life on her own terms.","During her first term as the first lady, from 2017 to 2021, Melania Trump’s fashion choices gradually transitioned toward a more armored and strategic style.

She described the operation as ""the largest massive deportation operation in history.""The Pentagon plans to use US Air Force C-17s and C-130s to deport around 5,400 people currently detained by Customs and Border Protection over the next few weeks, as per media reports.During his campaign, Trump promised stricter measures on illegal immigration. On his first day in office after taking oath, he signed executive orders declaring a ""national emergency"" at the southern border, which borders Mexico. The US president announced the deployment of additional troops, and pledged to deport ""criminal aliens.""In Newark, a city in US state of New Jersey, immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a raid, detaining undocumented individuals and some US citizens, according to city mayor Ras J Baraka. He said the agents did not produce a warrant and described the detention of a US military veteran as unconstitutional.An ICE update on X confirmed “538 arrests” and “373 detainers lodged.”New Jersey Democratic Senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim expressed concern over the Newark raid. In a joint statement, they said, “Actions like this one sow fear in all of our communities — and our broken immigration system requires solutions, not fear tactics.”The Trump administration announced plans to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” policy, requiring asylum seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed. It also halted an asylum program for people fleeing authoritarian regimes in Central and South America, leaving many stranded on the Mexican side of the border.Earlier in the week, the Republican-led Congress approved a bill to expand pretrial detention for foreign criminal suspects.Trump has described illegal migration as ""poisoning the blood"" of the nation, a statement criticized by opponents as having historical associations with Nazi Germany.Meanwhile, external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar, in a press conference after a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington, said that India is open to the return of undocumented Indian nationals from the United States.Speaking to reporters, Jaishankar had said, ""We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not here legally, if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been, you know, open to their legitimate return to India."" He said that this has been India’s consistent position with all countries.According to the Pew Research Center, Indians, numbering 725,000, were the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the US in 2022, following Mexico and El Salvador.","US authorities arrested 538 migrants and deported hundreds of "" illegal immigrants "" on Thursday in a large-scale operation.

Putin's Stunning Reaction After Trump's Sanction Shocker; 'I Know Him, He Can't...' | Watch

LONDON: Harrow East MP Bob Blackman has raised the storming of Harrow Vue cinema last Sunday night in the UK Parliament, describing the masked Khalistanis who barged into the movie and got the film “Emergency” stopped as “terrorists”.The Tory MP has called on home secretary Yvette Cooper to make a statement about the incident outlining what she will do to ensure the British public can watch films, that are passed by censors, in peace.Sikh Federation UK says it is reporting Blackman to the parliamentary commissioner for standards for “unacceptable conduct” for describing Khalistanis who, it says, are peaceful protesters objecting to the film, as “terrorists” and for defaming and demonising Sikhs who are “calling for the re-establishment of a Sikh homeland”.On Sunday a group of around 30 masked Khalistani men and one woman barged into the Harrow cinema, which was packed with PIOs watching the Kangana Ranaut flick. The protesters tried to block the projector and spread across the cinema, holding their fists up and shouting “Khalistan Zindabad” and “Indian govt murderers”. Everyone fled their seats except a small group of British Indians who got into a blazing row with them. The film was cancelled and the police were called but no arrests were made.Blackman said in the House of Commons on Thursday: “At about 30 or 40 minutes into the screening, masked Khalistani terrorists burst in, threatened members of the audience and forced the screening to end… This is a very controversial film, and I don’t comment on the quality or content of it, but I defend the right of my constituents and others to be able to view that film. There are certain views that this is an anti-Sikh film, but I think our constituents should be able to see this film and judge for themselves, and not be threatened by thugs who want to disrupt democratic opportunities to see public films.”He said he had nothing against people demonstrating outside cinema halls.Lucy Powell, leader of the House of Commons, agreed British people should be able to go about their activities freely and she would update the House on this “important matter”.Blackman described it as “horrific intimidation” of his constituents by “pro-Khalistan thugs” on X, saying: “We must stand up to anyone trying to silence free speech.”Owing to similar protests elsewhere, the film has now been pulled from almost all cinemas in Britain.","Harrow East MP Bob Blackman has raised the storming of Harrow Vue cinema last Sunday night in the UK Parliament.

The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as defence secretary in a dramatic late-night vote following a high-tempered battle marked by behavioural accusations.The outcome resulted in a 50-50 split, with three Republicans opposing, necessitating Vice President JD Vance 's tiebreaking vote.Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and former GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky cast dissenting votes.Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, whose position remained uncertain until the voting process, ultimately supported Trump's nomination, enabling confirmation through Vance's decisive vote.Murkowski's opposition stemmed from concerns about infidelity, ""allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking"" and Hegseth's previous statements regarding women in military service.She emphasised that his acknowledged conduct demonstrated poor judgement unsuitable for a military leader.Concerned Veterans for America (CVA), the organisation implicated in various allegations during the confirmation hearings, issued a supportive statement following his confirmation.""The confirmation of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense presents a real opportunity to prioritise the security and prosperity of our citizens, champion prudence and effectiveness in our defense strategy, and focus our Department of Defense on America's most vital interests,"" the statement read.A December report by The New Yorker revealed Hegseth's forced departure from CVA, his former organisation, citing financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and personal misconduct allegations.The unanimous Democratic opposition contrasted sharply with the recent unanimous confirmation of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, approved 99-0.As the new head of the government's largest agency, Hegseth has committed to eliminating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives across all branches.","Pete Hegseth confirmed as defence secretary in a dramatic late-night vote.

FAREWELL FEMA?: President Trump visits town ‘treated badly’ by Democrats

US President Donald Trump on Friday toured disaster-stricken areas in North Carolina and California, criticising the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) and considering ""getting rid of"" it.In North Carolina, still reeling months after Hurricane Helene devastated the state, Trump floated the idea of eliminating FEMA altogether. He proposed channelling federal disaster funds directly to states instead, a move he argued would reduce bureaucracy and speed up recovery efforts.""FEMA has been a very big disappointment,"" Trump said during a visit to the Asheville area. ""It's very bureaucratic. And it's very slow. I'd like to see the states take care of disasters—let them handle the tornadoes and hurricanes and everything else. That would be quicker and cheaper.""North Carolina residents shared harrowing stories with Trump about wading through floodwaters and battling insurance companies to rebuild their lives. Trump vowed to improve their situation, blaming the Biden administration for delays in recovery efforts.""You are not forgotten any longer,"" Trump said during a briefing on recovery efforts. ""You were treated very badly by the previous administration.""While FEMA has distributed $319 million in financial assistance to the state, Trump criticised the agency's overall response, calling it inadequate. Some residents, like Laurie Carpenter of Newland, North Carolina, welcomed Trump's visit, believing he might accelerate recovery efforts. Others, like Sarah Wells Rolland of Asheville, were more sceptical, citing concerns about long-term support.Later in the day, Trump travelled to wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles, where he met California governor Gavin Newsom on the tarmac. Despite their contentious history, the two leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Newsom acknowledging Trump's past support during the COVID-19 pandemic.""We're going to need your support. We're going to need your help,"" Newsom told Trump, emphasising the urgency of wildfire recovery.Trump's comments on FEMA suggest he is considering reducing the federal government's role in disaster response. The agency, which helps coordinate relief efforts and provide financial assistance during emergencies, has faced scrutiny from Trump and conservative allies who view its operations as inefficient.Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under President Biden, defended the agency, saying, ""The American people expect the federal government will be there for them on their worst day, no matter where they live.""Trump’s appointment of Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with limited disaster management experience, as FEMA's acting director has also raised eyebrows.Trump’s disaster tours in North Carolina, a key battleground state, and California, a Democratic stronghold, carried clear political undertones. He used the visits to highlight his administration's efforts while criticizing his predecessor's handling of disasters.","US President Donald Trump toured disaster-stricken areas in North Carolina and California.

Michelle Obama’s absence fuels speculation

No official word yet

A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm, fueled by discussions of a possible separation and an alleged connection between Barack Obama and actress Jennifer Aniston . Amid this, Megyn Kelly, host of The Megyn Kelly Show , addressed the rumours and said ""it would be a political earthquake"" if it were true.Kelly's social media posts on X and Instagram rapidly spread, drawing attention to the potential consequences of such a separation. ""I don't know whether it is true,"" she said, ""but if it is, it truly would be a political earthquake in Democratic circles, never mind America.""In her video, Kelly further emphasised the rarity of presidential divorces, saying ''I don't remember a presidential divorce in modern history.''A post on X has added fuel to the fire, claiming that Jennifer Aniston is romantically involved with Barack Obama. The post alleged that a friend of Aniston revealed the relationship during a casual conversation at a gathering. ""He's with Jennifer Aniston. My old manager, now a friend, is connected to her inner circle. At a gathering with Jennifer's friends, the affair came up casually -- Jennifer herself admitted it. They were sitting with a psychic, which makes it sound surreal, but it's definitely not a secret among her closest friends,"" the message read.The message has since gone viral, sparking heated debates and widespread speculation. Social media users were quick to point out that the rumours align with earlier tabloid claims, despite Aniston's public denial during an October appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Laughing off a magazine cover story suggesting a romance with Barack Obama, Aniston called the claims ""absolutely untrue"" but joked that she wasn't offended by them.The rumours of a split gained traction when Michelle Obama was noticeably absent from key events, including the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.Michelle’s team later clarified that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii during the Carter funeral. However, reports suggesting that she has distanced herself from Washington, life and spends little time with Barack have added to the speculation.As the rumours continue to swirl, neither Barack nor Michelle Obama has commented publicly on the matter. Similarly, Jennifer Aniston has not addressed the latest claims.","A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm.

Donald Trump Jr has a stark warning for any Republican who votes against Tulsi Gabbard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-jr-has-a-stark-warning-for-any-republican-who-votes-against-tulsi-gabbard/articleshow/117525757.cms,"2020 Democratic Debate - SNL

Why Gabbard has an uphill battle



Donald Trump Jr. issued a stark warning to Republican senators ahead of the confirmation hearing for Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI). In a tweet, Trump Jr. wrote, “Any Republican Senator who votes against @TulsiGabbard deserves a primary. No more Deep State b******!!!!”The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing on January 30 to assess Gabbard’s qualifications. The hearing follows delays from Senate Democrats, who cited incomplete background checks, ethics disclosures, and other paperwork on the controversial nominee.If confirmed, Gabbard—a former Democratic congresswoman—would oversee all 18 US intelligence agencies. However, her nomination has sparked sharp debate in Washington. Critics point to her lack of intelligence experience and her controversial relationships with US adversaries.Gabbard faced scrutiny for meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2017, shortly after allegations emerged that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. She has also been a vocal defender of whistleblower Edward Snowden and has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine.Despite these concerns, Gabbard has sought to build bipartisan support, notably reversing her stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Once critical of the program, Gabbard now supports its use to allow US intelligence agencies to monitor foreign nationals abroad without a warrant.“If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people,” Gabbard said in a statement earlier this month.Her shift on Section 702 has garnered support from prominent Republican lawmakers, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).The upcoming hearing is expected to be contentious, as senators from both parties weigh Gabbard's qualifications and past actions against her recent pledges to support national security initiatives.Tulsi Gabbard's lack of formal intelligence experience is a major concern for her nomination as Director of National Intelligence (DNI), given the critical oversight role of managing the US's 18 intelligence agencies. While her military and congressional background is notable, critics argue it may not sufficiently prepare her for the complexities of the intelligence domain.Her foreign policy stances have drawn bipartisan criticism. Gabbard's 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, known for human rights abuses, and her controversial comments on US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, perceived as echoing Russian propaganda, have raised serious questions about her judgment.Gabbard’s perceived sympathies toward adversarial nations, including Russia and Syria, have further fueled skepticism about her ability to provide unbiased intelligence assessments. These perceptions stem from her public statements and diplomatic interactions that some view as overly conciliatory.Read: The obscure cult that could ruin Tulsi Gabbard's chances The most contentious issue is her association with the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF), a religious organization described by critics as cult-like. Allegations that SIF leader Chris Butler exerted influence over her political career raise concerns about potential undue external influence in her decision-making.Her shifting political allegiances, including her departure from the Democratic Party and endorsement of Donald Trump, have raised eyebrows. This evolution in her political stance has alienated members of both parties, complicating her confirmation prospects.Ethical and financial concerns have also emerged. Delays in her confirmation hearings are attributed to incomplete ethics paperwork, and scrutiny of her financial disclosures, including media earnings and book deals, has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest.Bipartisan opposition presents a significant hurdle for Gabbard’s nomination. Senators from both sides, including Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Tammy Duckworth, have voiced reservations, reflecting widespread unease about her suitability for the DNI role.Public and intelligence community skepticism adds to the challenges. Figures like John Bolton have openly criticized her nomination, citing her controversial past and perceived vulnerabilities, which many argue make her unfit to manage the nation’s intelligence operations.","Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, is President Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing on January 30 to assess her qualifications.

A Cultural and Political Crossroads



The abrupt exit of Indian-American billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy from the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) has raised questions about the factors leading to his ouster. Was it his controversial tweet about H-1B visas and American mediocrity, his Hindu faith, or deeper political struggles involving tech magnate Elon Musk ? The incident shines a spotlight on political ambition, cultural identity, and the challenges of fitting into a movement grappling with its inclusivity.Ramaswamy ignited a firestorm in December with a tweet criticizing what he described as America’s “cultural veneration of mediocrity.” In his post, he argued that the US had deprioritized academic excellence in favor of social conformity, tracing this trend back to cultural shifts in the 1990s. He suggested this cultural failing—not an innate IQ gap—was why top tech companies often hired foreign-born engineers over native-born Americans.He used examples from pop culture, pointing to the glorification of prom queens and star athletes over valedictorians and science champions as indicative of a society celebrating “normalcy” over intellectual achievement. Immigrant families, he argued, placed a higher premium on academic excellence, which accounted for their dominance in STEM fields.Ramaswamy called for a “cultural reset,” urging America to refocus on intellectual pursuits and academic competition while cautioning that the nation risked losing its edge to countries like China. While some praised his comments as a much-needed wake-up call, others accused him of elitism and undermining American workers by advocating for high-skilled immigration reforms.This polarizing tweet placed Ramaswamy in the crosshairs of MAGA’s anti-immigration faction, compounding existing frustrations within Trump’s team.The situation escalated when National File published an article claiming that Ramaswamy had linked his departure from DOGE to backlash over his tweet. The report, attributed to journalist Patrick Howley, quoted Ramaswamy allegedly confirming that his tweet was a factor in his exit. “Obviously,” he was reported to have said.Ramaswamy vehemently denied the claims, calling the allegations “lies” in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Dude, I have no idea who you are, never got a text from you, and would never reply if I did,” he wrote. Reacting to the ongoing speculation, he doubled down: “Lies. Never spoke to these clowns.”Despite his denials, rumors persisted that the tweet was the final straw for Ramaswamy’s position at DOGE. While his remarks alone may not have been enough to force his departure, insiders suggest they exacerbated tensions with Elon Musk, who played a pivotal role in his removal.Elon Musk’s growing influence within DOGE—and the broader Trump administration—has been a contentious subject. As co-chair of DOGE, Musk is seen as the driving force behind its agenda, frequently clashing with Washington’s bureaucratic norms. According to sources, Musk grew increasingly frustrated with Ramaswamy’s attempt to balance his role at DOGE with a gubernatorial campaign in Ohio.“Musk has an iron grip on DOGE,” a Republican strategist told Politico. “And when he decided Ramaswamy wasn’t a fit, it was only a matter of time.”Reports indicate Musk viewed Ramaswamy’s dual ambitions as a distraction from DOGE’s mission. “You can’t have one foot in DOGE and the other in politics,” one insider quoted Musk as saying. The tweet criticizing America’s mediocrity only amplified these frustrations, making it easier for Musk to push Ramaswamy out.Ironically, Musk himself has courted controversy, including agreeing with a X user who called Trump supporters “r****” in a tweet. Despite this, his position within DOGE remains unchallenged, further highlighting his unparalleled influence.DOGE was launched as a cornerstone of Trump’s second-term agenda, tasked with streamlining government and cutting federal bureaucracy. Its ambitious goals included eliminating entire agencies, modernizing federal technology, and reducing federal jobs by 75%—a plan Trump claimed could save $2 trillion. Musk, however, recently revised expectations, admitting that even $1 trillion in savings might be optimistic.Ramaswamy, known for his business acumen and conservative principles, was initially seen as a key figure in achieving these goals. However, his polarizing views and blunt communication style quickly alienated members of Trump’s inner circle.“They wanted him out before the tweet—but kicked him to the curb when that came out,” a source told Politico. Ramaswamy’s December post was viewed as the tipping point, compounding Musk’s frustrations and sealing his fate.Ramaswamy’s ouster also highlights the challenges Indian-Americans face within MAGA’s nativist factions. Despite their alignment with conservative ideals such as free markets and innovation, figures like Ramaswamy remain outsiders in a movement that often views multiculturalism as a threat. Ramaswamy has often found himself defending his own faith amongst MAGA adherents.The experience of Usha Vance, the Hindu wife of Vice President JD Vance, illustrates this tension. During Vance’s inauguration, Usha’s presence drew both admiration and crude attacks from MAGA’s fringes. Comments like “Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol” reveal the discomfort many within the movement feel toward non-Christian identities.Ramaswamy’s unapologetic Hinduism has also drawn criticism. His references to the Bhagavad Gita are viewed by some evangelicals as antithetical to MAGA’s Christian nationalist ethos. As one commentator put it, “Ramaswamy is the perfect candidate on paper, but his Hinduism keeps him at arm’s length.”Ramaswamy is not alone in navigating MAGA’s complicated relationship with Indian-Americans. Other prominent figures include: Kash Patel , who became a hero within MAGA for his role in battling the “deep state” but remains a polarizing figure.• Dr Jay Bhattacharya, the Stanford professor who opposed COVID-19 lockdowns and emerged as a leading voice in MAGA’s pandemic skepticism. Sriram Krishnan , tapped by Trump to advise on artificial intelligence but criticized for supporting immigration reforms that MAGA’s nativists oppose.While these figures symbolize MAGA’s strategic embrace of diversity, their presence often sparks backlash among the movement’s more nativist wings.Ramaswamy’s departure from DOGE reflects broader challenges facing Trump’s administration. While DOGE’s goals are ambitious, its lack of formal authority and mounting legal challenges raise questions about its viability. Critics argue that the initiative may amount to little more than political theater.For Ramaswamy, the fallout from his ouster complicates his political aspirations. As he pivots to a gubernatorial run in Ohio, he must contend with perceptions of being sidelined by Musk and suspicions about his commitment to MAGA’s America First agenda.Musk’s influence, meanwhile, continues to grow. While some view him as a visionary capable of transforming government, others warn of the risks of concentrating so much power in a single tech billionaire. Musk’s dominance over DOGE, coupled with Trump’s reliance on him, raises concerns about a “tech oligarchy” shaping US policy.","The abrupt exit of Indian-American billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy has raised questions about the factors leading to his ouster. Was it his controversial tweet about H-1B visas and American mediocrity, or deeper political struggles involving tech magnate Elon Musk? The incident shines a spotlight on political ambition, cultural identity, and the challenges of fitting into a movement grappling with its inclusivity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117529407,imgsize-68340,width-400,resizemode-4/117529407.jpg"

Trump’s complicated legacy

Vice President JD Vance: We need a culture that celebrates life at all stages

Tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists , reportedly joined by masked neo-Nazis, gathered on Friday in Washington for the 52nd annual ' March for Life ' rally. Buoyed by recent victories in restricting abortion access and US President Donald Trump 's return to the White House, the event marked a pivotal moment for the ""pro-life"" movement.The rally celebrated the group’s biggest triumph in 2022 when the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a landmark decision that had guaranteed abortion rights across the United States for nearly five decades.Trump, addressing the crowd through a pre-recorded video message, promised unwavering support for their cause during his second term, pledging to ""protect the historic gains"" made by the anti-abortion movement. ""In my second term, we will again stand proudly for families and for life,"" he declared.The rally, held on the National Mall, was attended by high-profile Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance , House speaker Mike Johnson , and Florida governor Ron DeSantis. DeSantis reinforced the movement’s ideology, calling the sanctity of life an ""enduring truth"" and the foundation of society.While the rally aimed to celebrate their achievements, it was not without controversy. Members of the far-right neo-Nazi group Patriot Front marched alongside other attendees, brandishing Christian symbols and military-style flags. The group, which espouses white supremacist conspiracy theories, sparked unease as they joined the event.The presence of the neo-Nazi group drew sharp criticism, given their history of violent demonstrations, including the infamous 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump’s past comments on that rally, where he claimed there were ""some very fine people on both sides,"" resurfaced, reigniting debates over his relationship with extremist groups.Organisers of the March for Life stressed that the movement's goal extends beyond changing laws to altering cultural attitudes. “We want to make abortion unthinkable,” one organiser said, underscoring their commitment to shaping the national conversation around reproductive rights .Since Roe's reversal, individual states have become battlegrounds for abortion legislation. Many conservative-led states have introduced sweeping bans, leaving nearly a third of women aged 18 to 44 living in areas where abortion is largely inaccessible, according to data from Politifact.Despite these restrictions, national polls consistently show that a majority of Americans support access to safe abortion, highlighting the divide between public opinion and legislative actions.Trump, who has claimed credit for the Supreme Court’s decision, remains a polarising figure in the anti-abortion movement. While he has described himself as the ""most pro-life president ever,"" his stance on key issues, including a federal abortion ban, has wavered.During his campaign, Trump avoided backing federal restrictions and even criticised Florida's six-week abortion ban. However, his administration’s actions, such as appointing three conservative justices instrumental in overturning Roe and pardoning anti-abortion activists jailed for clinic blockades, have cemented his legacy within the movement.As Trump embarks on his second term, his promises to support anti-abortion efforts have reignited debates on the future of reproductive rights in America. But with polls showing growing discontent over restrictive abortion laws, the movement faces challenges in reconciling its legislative victories with public opinion.The march concluded with participants heading toward the Supreme Court and US Capitol complex, a symbolic nod to the movement’s continued fight in state and federal arenas. For now, the ""pro-life"" movement is savouring its victories while preparing for the next chapter in the battle over abortion rights.","Anti-abortion activists gathered in Washington for 52nd annual'March for Life'Rally celebrated the group’s biggest triumph in 2022 when the conservative- majority Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade.

Such actions not only stifle freedom of expression and assembly but also set a dangerous precedent of suppressing dissent through force and digital censorship.""""I urge these organizations to pressure the authorities to restore internet services without delay and to ensure that the fundamental rights of the Baloch people to assemble peacefully and voice their concerns are respected. The international community must not remain silent in the face of these repressive measures, as their silence could embolden further human rights violations in the Balochistan,"" the post added.Notably, the internet blackout comes days before Baloch Genocide Remembrance Day , scheduled for January 25, when the people of Balochistan will come together to protest the ongoing atrocities.Serious concerns are being raised due to this history of repression, with fears that the government may use violence to suppress peaceful opposition in Dalbandin once again.The internet blackout heightens concerns among Baloch Youth Conference (BYC) organizers about a possible crackdown on the event. The shutdown severely limits the Baloch people's ability to record and share their experiences of human rights violations, as communication routes are cut off.On Thursday, Mahrang Baloch, in her post on X, said that Pakistauthorities have imposed an internet blackout in Dalbandin. The post noted that the digital crackdown is reminiscent of an unsettling trend. Similar internet restrictions were imposed during the Baloch National Gathering in Gwadar in July last year, where organisers and attendees of the event were brutally suppressed afterwards.",Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch has called on human rights organisations to address the internet blackout in Dalbandin.

"Free Speech In Pakistan: Pakistan introduces law allowing government to block platforms, imprison users for spreading 'disinformation' on social media",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-introduces-law-allowing-government-to-block-platforms-imprison-users-for-spreading-disinformation-on-social-media/articleshow/117490772.cms,"Pakistan's government has tightened its grip on social media with a new law that critics fear will threaten free speech and further erode democratic freedoms.The controversial legislation, passed by the country's lower house of parliament on Thursday, grants sweeping powers to the government to control online content, including the ability to block platforms and imprison users for spreading ""disinformation.""The law requires social media companies to register with a government-controlled authority and gives officials the power to immediately block content deemed ""unlawful and offensive,"" such as criticism of judges, military, or government itself. Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse. This move comes at a time when press freedom in Pakistan is already under increasing pressure. Journalists report facing state pressure, and many media outlets have been instructed to avoid mentioning Imran Khan by name.","Pakistan's lower house of parliament passed a new law on Thursday.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.
