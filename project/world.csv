Operation Trashi-I: Gunfight Erupts In J&K’s Kishtwar; Eight Army Personnel Injured

NEW DELHI: Eight Army personnel were injured on Sunday in a prolonged gunfight with terrorists in a remote forested area of the upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district.The encounter, which lasted for several hours, erupted when security forces came in contact with terrorists during a search operation in the general area of Sonnar, northeast of Chatroo. The operation, launched around noon, has been named Operation Trashi-I by the Army’s Jammu-based White Knight Corps.In a post on X, the White Knight Corps said the search was part of ongoing joint counter-terror operations being conducted with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. “Operations remain underway with additional forces inducted to reinforce the cordon, supported by close coordination with civil administration and security agencies,” the Army said, praising the troops for their professionalism while responding to hostile fire in difficult terrain and conditions.Officials said one of the search teams encountered a group of two to three foreign terrorists, believed to be affiliated with Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).The terrorists allegedly opened indiscriminate fire and hurled grenades in an attempt to break the cordon. The troops retaliated, following which reinforcements from the Army, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and police were rushed to the area to tighten the cordon.Intermittent firing continued until around 5.40 pm. Eight soldiers sustained injuries, mostly splinter wounds from grenade blasts, and were evacuated to hospital. A massive search operation is continuing to track down and neutralise the terrorists.Advanced surveillance equipment, including drones, along with sniffer dogs, has been deployed to speed up the operation.This is the third encounter between security forces and terrorists in the Jammu region this year. Earlier gunfights were reported in the Kahog and Najote forests of the Billawar area in Kathua district on January 7 and 13.On December 15 last year, a police officer was killed in an encounter with terrorists in Soan village of the Majalta area in Udhampur district. The terrorists managed to escape by taking advantage of thick foliage and darkness.These encounters come in the wake of a major counter-terror operation launched across forest belts of the Jammu region in December last year to flush out nearly three dozen terrorists believed to be hiding in the area.Security operations have been further intensified ahead of Republic Day amid intelligence inputs of renewed attempts by Pakistan-based handlers to push in more terrorists, officials said.","Eight soldiers sustained injuries, mostly splinter wounds from grenade blasts, and were evacuated to hospital.

How India got its first woman PM this day in 1966,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-india-got-its-first-woman-pm-this-day-in-1966/articleshow/126663187.cms,"On Jan 19, 1966, the high-domed Central Hall of Parliament — where India’s Constitution had been adopted — witnessed a spectacle unlike any before. For the first time since Independence, the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) elected its leader through a full-fledged contest. Out of that tense, four-hour drama emerged Indira Gandhi , 48, as India’s first woman Prime Minister.“She was cheered as she entered the hall, clad in a white sari with a light brown shawl wrapping her shoulders,” TOI reported. When the returning officer announced, “I declare Mrs Gandhi elected,” the hall broke into “thunderous cheers”. It was not merely a personal triumph. The vote marked a turning point for the Congress party — and for the way succession battles would be fought within it.After Lal Bahadur Shastri’s sudden death in Tashkent, in Jan 1966, India was without a Prime Minister once again. Acting PM Gulzarilal Nanda took charge.Indira Gandhi did not enter a smooth succession. The only daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, she had long lived in his shadow — first as his companion, later as a political figure in her own right. She had served as information minister under Shastri and as Congress president in 1960.Powerful regional leaders — chief ministers of 11 of India’s then 16 states — rallied behind her, signalling support just four days before the vote. Another contender, Nanda, withdrew. But Morarji Desai, the formidable former finance minister, refused to step aside.“Why should I form a separate party? I am a true Congressman and I will remain in the Congress,” Desai declared. What many expected to be a smooth transition became one of the most bitterly fought leadership contests in India’s parliamentary history.At the centre of the storm was Congress president K Kamaraj, who tried to avoid a contest. However, Desai insisted on a ballot, alleging “pressure” on MPs to back a particular candidate. Chief ministers, he said, had “no business” imposing their preferences on the CPP. Kamaraj countered that in a federal democracy, the views of the states mattered.On the eve of the vote, Desai told reporters that MPs were “not dumb cattle” and framed the battle as one between the party establishment and ordinary parliamentarians. He said he had proof of pressure — but declined to elaborate, arguing that naming supporters could expose them to victimisation if he lost.As the vote neared, Delhi became a political beehive. Chief ministers met MPs from their states, and journalists camped outside the homes of Kamaraj, Desai and Indira Gandhi.On Jan 19, the Central Hall filled with 526 Congress MPs — a record turnout. Desai arrived first, greeting members with folded hands. Minutes later, Indira Gandhi walked in, went up to Desai, said “namaste,” and posed with him as photographers urged them to clasp hands.In the nominations, the lines were clear. Desai was proposed by K Hanumanthaiya. Indira Gandhi’s name was proposed by acting Prime Minister Nanda and seconded by Sanjiva Reddy.Counting dragged on through the afternoon, fuelling tension and rumours of an imminent result. Four times there were false alarms. Then, around 3pm, the returning officer emerged.“I declare Mrs Gandhi elected.”The figures were emphatic: 355 votes for Indira Gandhi, 169 for Morarji Desai — nearly 68% of the valid votes, a two-thirds majority that even her supporters had scarcely dared hope for. What followed was as theatrical as the contest itself. Amid cheers, the two candidates shook hands and posed for press photographers and TV crews. Outside Parliament House, crowds had gathered all day; when the result became known, they cheered as Gandhi went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to meet the President S Radhakrishnan to form a new govt.Desai pledged cooperation, though with a sting: he hoped that “at least in future, an atmosphere of fearlessness” would be created in party and country. Indira Gandhi, at her first press conference, rejected any insinuation of foul play. “The insinuation that unfair play had a part in this election was unjustified,” she said, while agreeing that fearlessness in public life mattered.Reactions poured in across India. C Rajagopalachari said Gandhi might be more broad-minded, and closer to Nehru’s outlook, than Desai. Women’s groups celebrated.Abroad, the response was swift. The Soviet news agency Tass flashed the news within minutes. Lord Mountbatten called her election one that was bound to have a stabilising effect in India.As Kamaraj told MPs that day, “We have elected Mrs Gandhi to take over the burden of the Prime Ministership of the country.”Research: Rajesh Sharma","After Lal Bahadur Shastri’s sudden death in Tashkent, in Jan 1966, India was without a Prime Minister once again.

FIR In July 2023, Suspects Not Even Identified Yet







IMPHAL: A 20-year-old from the Kuki-Zo community, who became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur, has died waiting for justice.Eighteen when she was abducted and allegedly ""handed over"" to members of an armed group, the woman carried physical and psychological injuries that never healed, culminating in her death on Jan 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum said.The FIR, filed two-and-a-half years ago, is still pending at Porompat police station in Imphal East. None among her alleged attackers has been even identified.Kuki-Zo organisations, including Committee on Tribal Unity, held a candlelight vigil Saturday, demanding accountability for the woman's trauma through the 30-odd months she lived since the assault. She first reported the alleged crime to Kangpokpi police on July 21, 2023, two months after it occurred.This was after she fled the Imphal Valley amid spiralling unrest there. The FIR states that she was abducted on May 15 that year from near an ATM booth in Imphal's New Checkon. Some women from a group involved in the ethnic clashes allowed four armed men belonging to a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually brutalising her before dumping her in a creek.The woman survived when an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables found her. The next day, she fled Imphal and sought treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital. She was referred to a hospital at Kohima in Nagaland and later to Guwahati in Assam.Despite months of medical care, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and deep psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation termed her death ""emblematic"" of the atrocities faced by the community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union govt to ensure justice was done to the young woman, saying punishing the perpetrators would ""uphold the spirit of the PM's Beti Bachao vision"".","20-year-old from Kuki-Zo community became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership. The draft gives Trump authority over membership, renewals, and final approval of decisions.","US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” The Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition.

‘He Was Screaming For Help’: SUV Plunges Into Flooded Pit, Techie Dies In Noida

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been lodged against two real estate developers after 27-year-old, Yuvraj Mehta, died when his car skidded off the road and plunged into an over 20-feet-deep, water-filled pit in Greater Noida amid dense fog. The victim’s family alleged that repeated requests to install barricades and reflectors at the accident-prone site were ignored, leading to the tragedy.The deceased, Yuvraj Mehta, was a resident of Tata Eureka Park society in Sector 150 and worked as a software engineer with a reputed company in Gurugram. He was returning home from work when the accident occurred in the early hours of Saturday, police said.ACP Hemant Upadhyay told PTI that the FIR has been lodged against the two developers on the basis of the complaint filed by Mehta’s family in connection with the incident.Moninder, a delivery agent and eyewitness, alleged that rescue efforts were delayed and said the techie could have been saved if timely action had been taken.Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Rajeev Narayan Mishra described the incident as unfortunate but denied negligence. He said, ""Police and fire department teams made efforts to save the youth. A fire department crane, ladder, makeshift boat and searchlights were used, but there was zero visibility at that time.""Police earlier said preliminary findings suggested fog and possible overspeeding as factors behind the accident.

CHENNAI: TVK president Vijay left for New Delhi on Sunday to appear before CBI on Monday for the second round of questioning in the Karur stampede probe.Vijay, who is being examined as a ‘witness,' is expected to depose before CBI around 11am. TVK functionaries said he would return to Chennai late on Monday itself, unless CBI decides to continue the questioning further.In his earlier appearance, Vijay told investigators that lapses in crowd control by local police during his Karur campaign led to the Sept 27 stampede that killed 41 people.He said bottlenecks were not cleared in time, slowing access to the venue and worsening congestion. He also defended his decision of leaving the spot after the stampede, stating that he did so to prevent the situation from escalating.TVK functionaries said investigators are expected to revisit details, including why he reached the venue late, crowd conditions he witnessed and whether his team received information about the crowd before the programme began. They may also seek clarity on whether police flagged concerns about proceeding further after he arrived near the Karur roundabout.On his return, Vijay is set to attend the first meeting of the party's 12-member election manifesto panel, led by general secretary Arun Raj, at its headquarters on Tuesday, where members will discuss outreach plans to gather inputs from different communities.Meanwhile, Madras High Court will take up a case linked to the delayed release of Vijay's film ‘Jana Nayagan.'The CBI probe and the delay in the film's release had kept the party's political activities muted.

Spain: Over 20 killed after high-speed trains collide; videos show passengers crawling out of windows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/spain-over-20-killed-after-high-speed-trains-collide-videos-show-passengers-crawling-out-of-windows/articleshow/126665841.cms,"Image: X@/Artemisfornow





At least 21 people were killed, and a dozen others were injured after a high-speed train derailed and collided with an oncoming train on Sunday evening in southern Spain.Passengers reportedly used emergency hammers to break windows, and some were able to walk away without serious injuries. Videos shared by people at the scene showed passengers crawling out through windows to escape the wreckage, with several carriages left leaning at an angle.Witnesses described the collision as feeling like an earthquake, with some passengers also reporting smoke inside the carriages and requiring medical attention, Euro News reported.The tail end of the Malaga–Madrid service carrying around 300 passengers went off the rails near Cordoba at about 7.45 pm (local time), crossed onto the opposite track and slammed into a Madrid–Huelva train with approximately 200 passengers onboard, according to rail operator ADIF.Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente confirmed the casualties as rescue operations continued at the site. Puente said the death toll could rise as authorities work to confirm additional victims.The hospitals of the Community of Madrid and the 112 emergency teams are on standby following the tragic accident in Cordoba and are at the disposal of the Andalusian Regional Government,"" said Madrid's regional president, Isabel Diaz Ayuso.Andalusia’s regional health chief, Antonio Sanz, said 73 injured passengers were taken to six different hospitals. The crash occurred in the early evening, and hundreds of survivors had to be rescued in the dark.Puente said the cause of the crash remained unknown, describing it as “a truly strange” incident as it occurred on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, as cited by AP.He added the rear section of the first train derailed and struck the front of the oncoming service, forcing its first two carriages off the track and down a four-metre slope. He said the most severe damage was sustained by the front section of the Renfe train.Asked about the timeline for determining the cause of the crash, Puente said the investigation could take up to a month.Francisco Carmona, the fire chief of Cordoba, told Spanish national radio RNE that one of the trains was badly mangled, with at least four wagons off the rails.Spain’s military emergency relief units were deployed alongside other rescue teams, while the Red Cross provided support to healthcare officials.Regional civil protection chief María Belén Moya Rojas said residents brought blankets and water to the scene to help the victims.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that she was following “the terrible news” from Cordoba.ADIF said that all train services running between Madrid and Andalusia have been suspended till further notice.","High-speed train derailed and collided with an oncoming train in southern Spain.

Running a red light has landed Indian truck driver Sukhdeep Singh at risk of deportation from US after authorities found he was in the country illegally.A routine traffic stop in Arizona turned serious when local police pulled over Singh for allegedly running a red light and a stop sign.According to authorities, Singh is an Indian national who was unlawfully present in US. This was confirmed by agents from the Border Patrol after running a brief check, even though Singh had a California commercial driver’s licence.He was taken into custody in the town of Quartzsite and is now being processed for deportation under 8 USC 1182, the section of US immigration law dealing with inadmissible non-citizens.The United States Border Patrol, Yuma Sector, confirmed the incident in a post on X: ""Quartzsite police pulled over Sukhdeep Singh after he ran a red light and a stop sign. Officers contacted Blythe Station Border Patrol agents who determined Singh is an Indian national that was illegally in the United States, despite being in possession of California commercial driver’s license. Singh will be processed for deportation under 8 USC 1182.Border Patrol officials said Singh’s case is not the only one that involves commercial truck drivers without legal immigration status present in US. Earlier operations by agents at the Blythe Station led to the arrest of six undocumented Indian nationals in separate incidents. In each case, the individuals were working as truck drivers and held commercial driving licences despite being in the country unlawfully.It was reported that all six were processed for deportation, and later lost the opportunity to legally re-enter the United States.Authorities also advised the undocumented individuals to voluntarily self-deport using the CBP Home app. This option allows people to leave the country on their own and may help preserve their eligibility to legally return to US in the future.For the last few months, California has been facing federal scrutiny for issuing thousands of commercial driver’s licences to non-citizens, including some without lawful status, in apparent violation of federal rules. The US Department of Transportation has revoked about 17,000 licences, withheld funding and tightened eligibility, saying states must verify immigration status for commercial licences. Most of the truck drivers are from India. The Trump administration blames the Biden-era rules that allegedly allowed thousands of immigrant truck drivers to attain a commercial license without proper english proficiency and formal legal procedures.","Sukhdeep Singh was stopped for running a red light and a stop sign in Arizona.

After Greenland Bid, Trump Warns Canada’s Arctic Is Exposed To Rivals Russia & China





US President Donald Trump late Sunday once again strongly reiterated his desire to bring Greenland under American control, claiming that Denmark had failed to counter the “Russian threat” to the Arctic island and declaring that “now it is time, and it will be done. ”In a post on Truth Social, Trump renewed his allegations against Denmark to justify his push for Greenland. He wrote, “Nato has been telling Denmark for 20 years that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”At the start of 2026, Trump has made his intentions increasingly clear. He began with a US strike on Venezuela that led to the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro, who was subsequently taken into American custody along with his wife. Trump then turned his attention to Greenland, saying the island should come under US control.However, both the Danish and Greenlandic governments have strongly opposed Trump’s proposal, with several European Union leaders also backing them and questioning the US president’s motives regarding the Arctic island.Earlier, Trump also threatened tariffs on any countries who don't abide by his motive of acquiring Greenland.European nations including Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom released a joint statement, which was later shared by Danish ministry of foreign affairs, said that the military exercise ""Arctic Endurance"" poses no threat to anyone and stressed on full solidarity with Denmark and people of Greenland.The statement also warned that the threat of tariffs could undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.On Saturday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the United Kingdom and other European countries unless they agreed to sell Greenland. He claimed the move was necessary for national security, citing Chinese and Russian interest in the territory.Trump offered to negotiate with European nations but warned that tariffs could escalate to 10 percent from February 1, 2026, and 25 percent from June 1, 2026, if no deal was reached, saying it was “time for Denmark to give back” after years of US support.Meanwhile, the people of Greenland voiced their resistance to Trump by holding protests across the snow-covered island, among the first such demonstrations of its kind there.","US President Donald Trump once again strongly reiterated his desire to bring Greenland under American control.

IMPHAL: A 20-year-old woman from the Kuki-Zo community, who survived mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic riots in Manipur, has died while waiting for justice. At 18, she was allegedly abducted, “handed over” to members of an armed group, gang-raped, and dumped in a creek.The FIR, filed 2.5 years ago at Porompat police station in Imphal East, remains pending, and none of her alleged attackers have been identified.The physical and psychological trauma she endured never healed, culminating in her death on January 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum (ITLF) said.The woman had fled the Imphal Valley amid escalating unrest.According to the FIR, she was abducted on May 15 from near an ATM booth in Imphal’s New Checkon.Some women involved in the ethnic clashes reportedly allowed four armed men from a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually assaulting her before dumping her in a creek.She survived after being discovered by an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables. The following day, she fled Imphal and sought medical treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital, before being referred to hospitals in Kohima, Nagaland, and Guwahati, Assam.Despite months of treatment, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and severe psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation described her death as “emblematic” of the atrocities faced by women and the Kuki-Zo community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union government to ensure justice for the young woman, stating that holding the perpetrators accountable would “uphold the spirit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Beti Bachao vision.”","20-year-old woman from the Kuki-Zo community survived mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic riots in Manipur.

A rifle-armed man was seen standing outside a home in Minnesota’s St. Paul, reportedly guarding the property after multiple raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in the area, according to a video circulating on social media.In the clip, the armed resident can be heard saying, “This is my block, this is my area. I don’t go around other people’s neighbourhoods trying to intimidate them. I’m trying to protect my people,” adding that “at least 30, or 40 or 50” people had gathered nearby.The video has surfaced amid heightened tensions across the Minneapolis–St Paul region following a large federal immigration enforcement operation and a recent court order restricting how agents interact with protesters.It follows a series of recent violent encounters linked to federal immigration activity this month. On January 14, a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during a targeted traffic stop in North Minneapolis. DHS said the man fled and struggled with officers before the shooting. Earlier on January 7, an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis during an enforcement action .On Friday, US District Judge Katherine Menendez issued an 83-page preliminary injunction barring federal immigration officers in Minnesota from arresting or detaining individuals engaged in “peaceful and unobstructive protest activity” and from retaliating against protected speech using tear gas, pepper spray or other crowd-control measures.The judge ruled that officers may not arrest individuals without probable cause or reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or that officers are being obstructed. She further directed that vehicles cannot be stopped without reasonable suspicion, noting that “safely following agents at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion,” according to the Associated Press.According to the White House, the US Second Amendment has preserved the American people's right to protect themselves, their families, and freedoms since the nation's founding stating ""Because it is foundational to maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and bear arms must not be infringed.""","A rifle-armed man was seen standing outside a home in Minnesota’s St. Paul, reportedly guarding the property after multiple raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in the area.

What comes next







A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant. Within minutes, protesters gathered outside, surrounding the deli, shouting insults and blowing whistles at the men as they attempted to leave. “We were just trying to eat lunch,” one of the engineers, identified as Lee, told Alpha News. “Next thing we know, people are yelling, ‘I hope you die,’ and calling us paedophiles.” Viral videos of the incident circulating online shows the group being pelted with insults and whistles as protesters attempt to block their exit, even after the men repeatedly explained they were not ICE agents.One person in the crowd can be heard dismissing their claims, “Do I look like an ICE agent?” to which a protester responded, “Yeah, you look like a f---ing ICE agent.” The tense encounter forced the men to leave under duress, leaving some questioning their own political assumptions after the incident.The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations.

Rescue teams in Indonesia on Sunday found debris from a small turboprop aircraft that went missing a day earlier in eastern Indonesia. However, the 10 people on board are yet to be located, officials said.The Indonesian Air Transport plane lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday afternoon while flying from Yogyakarta to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province. Authorities launched a large-scale search operation after communication with the aircraft was cut shortly after 1 pm local time.At a press briefing, Muhammad Arif Anwar, head of the Makassar search and rescue agency, said the joint rescue team had recovered aircraft parts believed to include “the fuselage, the tail section, and the windows”. He said both ground and aerial units were continuing efforts to trace the missing passengers and crew, as reported by AFP.“Our current priority is locating victims, and we hope there are still some we can evacuate in a safe condition,” Arif said. He added that an aerial rescue unit had also been deployed to support the search.According to officials, the aircraft crashed into Mount Bulusaraung inside Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park, a mountainous area that borders the city of Makassar.The terrain, combined with poor visibility, has made rescue efforts challenging.Local military chief Bangun Nawoko told reporters that the operation was being hindered by harsh terrain and dense fog. “These conditions are slowing movement on the ground and limiting visibility from the air,” he said.More than 1,000 personnel have been involved in the search operation, including teams from the air force, police, search and rescue agencies and local volunteers.Helicopters, drones and ground teams have been deployed across Maros Regency, near the plane’s last known location, officials said. Multiple agencies are coordinating the effort to ensure coverage of difficult-to-reach areas.Authorities said there were 10 people on board the aircraft, including seven crew members and three government employees from the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono said the officials were travelling on official duty.“They were on a mission to conduct aerial monitoring of resources in the area,” Trenggono said, confirming that his ministry was in close contact with rescue agencies and the families of those on board.Aircraft manufacturer ATR said it had been informed of “an accident” involving one of its planes and was supporting the ongoing response. “ATR specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation led by the Indonesian authorities and the operator,” the company said in a statement.Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, depends heavily on air transport to connect its remote and geographically dispersed regions. However, the country has faced repeated aviation safety challenges over the years, with several fatal accidents involving both planes and helicopters.In September last year, a helicopter carrying six passengers and two crew members crashed shortly after taking off from South Kalimantan province, killing everyone on board.

UAE: Winter cool continues

NCM weather alerts





On Sunday, January 18, 2026, the UAE will see a continuation of winter-like conditions, with temperatures remaining mild to cool for this time of year. Residents can expect highs not exceeding around, while overnight lows could dip into the upper teens, around 18°C in Abu Dhabi and 19°C in Dubai, according to the National Centre of Meteorology forecasts.This pattern follows an ongoing winter chill that began earlier in the month and has brought a general drop in daytime temperatures, cool nights, and occasional early-morning fog or mist in inland areas.The skies over much of the country on January 18 are expected to be generally partly cloudy, with low cloud formations over some coastal, northern, and eastern regions.Cloud cover tendencies have been part of this week’s weather, with earlier forecasts predicting light rainfall and changing haze at times.While rain is not widely expected on Sunday itself, the pattern of cloud development increases the chance of mist or light fog during the night and early morning, particularly over internal areas, a trend seen frequently this winter season.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued weather alerts for parts of the UAE due to winter conditions affecting visibility, wind, and sea state. Fog and low-visibility alerts are in place for internal and coastal areas, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, with motorists advised to drive cautiously.Strong wind and rough sea warnings apply to the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman, where conditions may turn rough to very rough, affecting marine activities and small vessels.In addition, dust and reduced visibility advisories may affect open inland areas, especially when winds strengthen.Residents are advised to follow official NCM updates and take precautions while travelling or heading out to sea.Looking toward the middle of the week, the UAE’s weather story takes another turn. By Wednesday, a more unsettled pattern is predicted to take hold, bringing a further drop in temperatures and a renewed chance of light rainfall, especially in northern and coastal areas. This is driven by an interaction between surface low pressure and upper-air troughs. While the rain may be scattered, the combination of stronger northwesterly winds and increased cloud cover ensures that the ""winter feel"" isn't going anywhere just yet.","Sunday, January 18, 2026, will see a continuation of winter-like conditions, with temperatures remaining mild to cool for this time of year.

Who is Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, and why is the Trump administration reviewing her immigration status? That question is now becoming a public debate in the US, after viral petitions demanded action against relatives of Iran’s ruling elite living in America.The White House has confirmed it is “reviewing” immigration benefits granted to Iranians under the Biden administration, following online campaigns calling for the deportation of family members of senior Iranian officials. One of the most important names is Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, the daughter of Ali Larijani, a powerful figure in Iran’s leadership and the current secretary of the country’s Supreme National Security Council.More than 41,000 people have signed a Change.org petition urging President Donald Trump to deport Ardeshir Larijani. Supporters claim that relatives of Iran’s ruling class should not enjoy life in the US while ordinary Iranians face repression at home.Ali Larijani recently faced backlash after posting online that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were “the main killers of the people of Iran”.His remarks came as Iran’s authorities were accused of killing thousands of protesters during recent unrest.Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani is a specialised cancer doctor and works at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia.According to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, she was granted a green card in 2021 during Joe Biden’s presidency.“The Trump Administration is reviewing all immigration benefits granted under former Biden administration to aliens from Countries of Concern including Iran,” McLaughlin told Newsweek.Emory University confirmed her employment but declined to comment further on the political row. “We are aware of media coverage regarding one of our physicians,” said Andrea Clement, associate director of public relations at the Winship Cancer Institute.They added: “Emory employees are hired in full compliance with applicable state and federal laws and other applicable requirements, including our commitment to advancing patient care, research, and teaching.”","Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani is the daughter of Iran's Supreme National Security Council secretary.

Democratic Congressman and Indian-origin leader Shri Thanedar is under fire after he remained seated during Donald Trump ’s joint address to Congress while the US president honoured families of children raped and murdered by illegal immigrants.Thanedar was later confronted over his actions during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Thanedar defended his decision, saying his refusal to stand was directed at Trump, not the victims’ families.“I did not stand because the president, I was just sick of the president,” Thanedar said on Friday’s episode of Hannity.Hannity challenged him: “You wouldn’t stand for families that lost children — a 12-year-old girl raped and murdered — and you couldn’t stand for them because you were playing politics.”Thanedar remained defiant: “I would not stand for this president. He was lying.” He added that Trump was “using a tragedy” for political purposes.During the address, Trump honoured several young women whom law enforcement says were killed by illegal immigrants. Among them was Jocelyn Nungaray, whose mother, Alexis Nungaray, attended the speech. Many Democrats remained seated as the families were recognised.During the interview, Hannity repeatedly asked Thanedar whether he had personally reached out to families affected by crimes linked to illegal immigration. Thanedar said he regularly speaks with people and claimed they are being “terrorised by ICE”.Thanedar has recently introduced legislation calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, arguing that “ICE is beyond reform”. His office said the proposal aims to create a “more humane approach to immigration policy”.His comments come after an ICE agent fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, Renee Nicole Good, during a confrontation with immigration agents earlier this month.","Congressman Shri Thanedar remained seated during Donald Trump's joint address to Congress.

The Nobel Foundation on Sunday reiterated that Nobel Prizes cannot be passed on—even symbolically—days after clarifying that a laureate cannot share the prize with others or transfer it once it has been announced.In a post on X, the Foundation said it upholds founder Alfred Nobel’s will and its stipulations, which state that the prizes are to be awarded to those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” and clearly define who has the authority to award each prize. “A prize can therefore not, even symbolically, be passed on or further distributed,” the post noted.The clarification follows remarks by self-exiled Venezuelan opposition leader and last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, who met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday and “presented” her Nobel medal to him. Machado described the gesture as a form of recognition for Trump’s support for Venezuelan freedom and democratic efforts.“I presented the President of the United States the medal—the Nobel Peace Prize—and I told him this: 200 years ago, General Lafayette gave Simón Bolívar a medal with George Washington’s face on it. Bolívar kept that medal for the rest of his life. It was given as a symbol of brotherhood to showcase the relationship between the people of the US and Venezuela,” she told reporters.“Two hundred years on, the people of Bolívar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal, in this case the Nobel Peace Prize medal, as recognition for his unique commitment to our freedom,” she added.Trump acknowledged the gesture in a post on Truth Social, calling it “a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.” “It was my great honor to meet Maria Corina Machado of Venezuela today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you, Maria!” the post read.Earlier, on January 16, the official Nobel Prize website clarified that “a laureate cannot share the prize with others, nor transfer it once it has been announced.” It added that a Nobel Peace Prize can never be revoked, that the decision is final for all time, and that the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on the day-to-day political activities of laureates.Trump had made an unsuccessful bid for the Nobel Peace Prize last year, claiming to have helped resolve ""eight wars"" since beginning his second and final term as president in January 2025.

Two Indian hotel operators have been arrested and charged in connection with a drug and sex trafficking operation at the Red Carpet Inn in Virginia.52-year-old Kosha Sharma and 55-year-old Tarun Sharma were taken into custody after an FBI raid on Thursday, part of a multi-year investigation.The Sharmas are married and are now accused of using the third floor of their motel for drug sales and prostitution while keeping guests on the lower floors. Court documents allege that they profited from illegal activity conducted at the property under the name Kosha LLC, doing business as Red Carpet Inn.“Drug trafficking and sex trafficking devastate communities by exploiting vulnerable individuals and fueling violence and addiction,” said Lindsey Halligan, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.She added: “Our office is committed to dismantling criminal enterprises that profit from human suffering. Working alongside our law enforcement partners, we will continue to hold offenders accountable and disrupt the cycles of exploitation that threaten our communities.”The charges include conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, including fentanyl. If convicted, the Sharmas face a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in prison.Since May 2023, authorities conducted nine prostitution encounters and 15 controlled purchases of narcotics at the Sharma's owned motel. Eleven of the purchases were for fentanyl and four for cocaine. Other defendants arrested include Margo Waldon Pierce, Joshua Roderick, and Rashard Perrish Smith, who allegedly distributed drugs or assisted in the operation. This makes up 5 total involved in the combined crimes.About 60 per cent of hotels in the United States are owned by Indian‑origin hoteliers, mostly through the Asian American Hotel Owners Association’s membership, which runs tens of thousands of properties nationwide. This mostly involves economy and mid‑scale hotels.","Kosha Sharma, 52, and Tarun Sharma, 55, were taken into custody after an FBI raid on Thursday, part of a multi-year investigation.

Becca Good, the partner and 'wife' of Renee Nicole Good, the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minnesota, may have become the next subject of investigation and interrogation as federal authorities are looking more into the unfortunate case.Renee Good was killed earlier this month when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle during an immigration operation in Minneapolis.Federal officials are now examining whether Becca Good may have hindered a federal officer moments before the shooting, according to NBC News. The inquiry is looking into Becca Good’s actions and background, including possible links to activist groups, according to officials.Renee Good was an American citizen and a mother of three. Video footage from the scene shows Ross confronting Good near her car. Ross is seen approaching the front of the SUV. Renee Good is heard saying, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you.” Another officer orders her to get out of the car.As Ross turns towards the front of the vehicle, Becca Good, present near the scene, appears to say, “Drive.” Renee Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, and begins to move.In Ross’s body footage, he can be heard shouting before firing multiple shots at point-blank range. Another ICE agent later says, “f-----g b**ch.”Becca Good’s lawyer denied that she is a target of the investigation. “There has been no contact from the FBI or federal officials indicating Becca Good is the subject of an investigation,” he said in a statement on Saturday.Federal officials said the probe into Becca Good is focused on a US law covering “assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers”.US President Donald Trump described Renee and Becca Good as “professional agitators."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said a day after the shooting that Renee Good’s actions amounted to “domestic terrorism”.Six federal prosecutors in Minneapolis have resigned amid concerns over how the case is being handled, calling it biased.A clarification later confirmed that Becca and Renee were not legally married, but Becca Good had previously referred to Renee as her partner and wife.","Becca Good, the partner and 'wife' of Renee Nicole Good, may have become the next subject of investigation and interrogation.

Turning a marginal job into a working one

A divided Palestinian landscape





“As we step into 2026, here’s hoping it becomes a year where common sense prevails, where rules are respected, facts carry more weight than slogans, and strength is measured not by reckless escalation, but by thoughtful restraint and wise choices. ”Nickolay Mladenov posted those words on X at the start of the year. Days later, he was named High Representative for Gaza, stepping into a role that places him at the center of one of the world’s most fragile and contested conflicts.Years earlier, when Rumiana Bachvarova had just begun her posting as Bulgaria’s ambassador to Israel, she paid a visit to her compatriot in Jerusalem. Mladenov took her to the Mount of Olives, overlooking the Old City.“This small place is the cornerstone of all the conflicts here,” he told her. “But see how beautiful it is.”At the time, Mladenov was several years into his role as the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, a position long viewed as symbolic and largely ineffective.Now 53, Mladenov faces perhaps his most difficult assignment. As High Representative for Gaza, he will serve as the main link between US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” and a technocratic committee of Palestinian officials meant to govern the devastated enclave.His task is to turn a US-brokered, 20-point ceasefire plan—still lacking crucial details—into a functioning framework that can rebuild Gaza, disarm Hamas, and govern a population of about two million people.For it to work, it must be acceptable to Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States.Alongside Mladenov on the Board of Peace are major figures, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. While they do not share his direct responsibility toward the technocratic committee, they shape the political environment in which the plan must operate.With little publicity, Mladenov has already met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior Palestinian officials as he prepares to take up his new role.Mladenov has declined to comment publicly on his appointment. When Witkoff announced the launch of the second phase of the ceasefire, Mladenov reposted the message without adding his own words.For a diplomat known for working quietly behind the scenes, the silence is familiar. Whether that approach can now help turn a fragile ceasefire into lasting peace for Gaza remains the central question.Before Mladenov’s tenure, UN envoys had focused on issuing statements—condemning Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and repeating support for a two-state solution. Their influence was limited, their warnings largely ignored.Mladenov arrived in Jerusalem in 2015 with a different approach. In an interview with the New York Times as he was leaving the role in late 2020, he said he was initially struck by how irrelevant the position seemed. Instead of relying on public statements, he focused on building trust.He shuttled between Israeli officials, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and Hamas leaders in Gaza, while also delivering his mandated monthly briefings to the UN Security Council in New York.Mladenov rarely made headlines, but behind the scenes he was deeply involved. Alongside Egypt, he played a role in bringing repeated escalations between Israel and Hamas to quick conclusions, helping prevent wider wars.Not everyone approved of his choices. Some diplomats in Jerusalem believed he paid too little attention to the Palestinian Authority, the body created in the 1990s as part of peace efforts and which still governs parts of the West Bank.A sympathetic reading of Mladenov’s strategy suggests he focused on the most influential actors under his mandate. But it also suited Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to have the most senior UN official in the region engage with Hamas while the Palestinian leadership remained divided.That division weakened the Palestinian cause internationally. Although Israel’s tacit approach toward Hamas collapsed after the October 7, 2023 attacks, concerns persist in Ramallah that new governance structures for Gaza could again sideline the Palestinian Authority by creating rival centers of power.Mladenov’s background helps explain why he was chosen for this moment. The Bulgarian politician became his country’s defense minister at just 37, then served as foreign minister for three years. Earlier, he was a member of the European Parliament and later the UN’s Special Representative for Iraq.Those roles built his reputation as a diplomat comfortable operating in fractured political environments.","Nickolay Mladenov was named High Representative for Gaza at the start of the year. He will serve as the main link between US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ and a technocratic committee of Palestinian officials. His task is to turn a US-brokered, 20-point ceasefire plan into a functioning framework that can rebuild Gaza.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126644305,imgsize-898080,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-38.jpg"

"Massive blaze at Karachi mall: Firefighter among six killed, many feared trapped",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/massive-blaze-at-karachi-mall-firefighter-among-six-killed-many-feared-trapped-video/articleshow/126643391.cms,"Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage



Many still trapped







At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have been killed in a mall fire in Karachi.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.
