KRISHNAGIRI: The fake NCC officer, Sivaraman, 35, arrested for raping school girls at unauthorised NCC camps at two private schools in Krishnagiri district, died early on Friday in a hospital where he was being treated for consuming rat poison.A few hours before that his father Ashok Kumar, 61, fell off his moped and died near Kaveripattinam. Police said he was drunk.AIADMK and BJP said they suspect the deaths were part of an attempt to protect influential people involved in the case.Krishnagiri district superintendent of police P Thangadurai warned of stringent action against people spreading false information about the deaths.State BJP president K Annamalai said Sivaraman might have been murdered to prevent him from disclosing the identities of key people involved in the case.""There are doubts whether all accused in the case have been arrested, and whether the deaths of the father-son duo were orchestrated to protect someone,"" Annamalai said and called on the special investigation team formed by the chief minister to uncover the truth.AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami asked whether police were attempting to protect influential people involved in the conduct of the unauthorised NCC camps. ""Chief minister M K Stalin should disclose the truth to the people of Tamil Nadu ,"" Palaniswami said.Thangadurai said Sivaraman had consumed rat poison on Aug 16 and on Aug 18 to end his life, fearing arrest in the rape case. ""He disclosed it to doctors on Monday, when he was admitted to the govt hospital in Krishnagiri with a fractured leg. We shifted him to the govt hospital in Salem on Wednesday for advanced treatment. However, his condition deteriorated and he died at 5.30am on Friday, despite doctors performing dialysis twice,"" the SP said. Sivaraman had attempted suicide by consuming rat poison on July 9 over a family dispute and was treated at a private hospital, he added.The SP said Sivaraman's father died around 10.15pm on Thursday after he fell off his moped while returning home after consuming alcohol. ""When he neared Therpatty near Kaveripattinam, he lost control of the moped and fell. He succumbed to head injuries on the spot. A CCTV camera at a nearby medical store captured the entire incident,"" Thangadurai said.The two bodies were handed over to the family after a postmortem on Friday evening. Padma, 55, Sivaraman's mother, said it was she who had reported her husband's death to the Kaveripattinam police on Thursday night. ""We learned the full details only after reviewing the CCTV camera footage,"" she said.","The fake NCC officer, Sivaraman, 35, died early on Friday in a hospital where he was being treated for consuming rat poison.

In this latest affirmation of India’s balancing act on the Russia-Ukraine war, something which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during Modi’s Kyiv visit he didn’t want India to do, Modi called for a sincere and practical engagement between all stakeholders for an early, abiding and peaceful resolution of the conflict.Modi’s visit to Ukraine followed his trip to Russia last month that had riled the Americans with its timing, coinciding as it did with the NATO summit in the US. Significantly, Moscow said Modi conveyed his “readiness’’ to visit Russia again this year for the BRICS summit in October.The talks with Putin took place a day after Biden called Modi and commended him for his “historic’’ trip and his message of peace. A Russian readout said Modi in his conversation with Putin emphasized his interest in contributing to a possible political and diplomatic settlement of the situation “around Ukraine’’. This follows the Indian PM’s assertion in Kyiv expressing willingness to contribute in all possible ways to facilitate an early return of peace.Modi’s remarks to Putin, as mentioned in an Indian statement, echoed the India-Ukraine joint statement in which he called for a sincere and practical engagement to “develop innovative solutions that will have broad acceptability’’.""Spoke with President Putin today.

Modi and Putin spoke a day after the Kremlin pledged response to the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region and described as irrelevant all ceasefire talks. In his meeting with Modi, Zelenskyy had said he wanted India to shun its balancing act and be on the side of Ukraine.The PM also recalled his “successful” visit to Russia last month to participate in the 22nd India-Russia Bilateral Summit, according to the Indian government, and the leaders discussed measures to further strengthen the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia.There were discussions also on trade and other agreements that they finalised during Modi’s visit to Russia. “Satisfaction was expressed with the level of interaction between the two countries in BRICS.

Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov , the man dubbed the "" Russian Zuckerberg "" for his creation of the VKontakte (VK) social network and Telegram messaging service, was arrested at a Paris airport this weekend. The 39-year-old faces legal challenges in France over alleged criminal activities linked to Telegram, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, and promoting terrorism.Durov, who shot to fame in his twenties with VKontakte, a social network that outpaced Facebook in the former USSR, has long been a polarizing figure, reported Reuters.His refusal to comply with Russian authorities led to his departure from VKontakte in 2014 and the subsequent launch of Telegram. The messaging service, known for its strong encryption and stance against censorship, quickly gained global popularity but has faced criticism for allegedly hosting extreme content.Durov's unconventional behavior includes a 2012 stunt where he showered high-denomination notes on pedestrians from VKontakte's headquarters. A self-declared libertarian, he champions internet confidentiality and refuses to moderate content on Telegram, further complicating his relationship with global authorities.Durov’s recent arrest follows a French warrant targeting him for various offences reportedly linked to activities on Telegram. The French gendarmerie's cyber unit and the national anti-fraud office are handling the case. Durov, who settled in Dubai and later acquired French nationality, remains in police custody.In addition to his business ventures, Durov has made headlines for personal claims, including reportedly boasting about fathering over 100 children through sperm donations. Despite his fortune, estimated at $15.5 billion by Forbes, his cryptocurrency, toncoin, has seen a significant decline following news of his arrest.Telegram’s role in global issues, including Russia’s war against Ukraine, has drawn attention. The platform's channels are used by both pro-Moscow and anti-Moscow factions, highlighting its controversial influence in geopolitical matters.As Durov’s legal battles continue, the future of Telegram and its controversial role in the digital age remain uncertain. Durov’s ongoing legal issues and the platform’s contentious position in global politics could have lasting impacts on both his fortune and the messaging service’s reputation.","Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport this weekend.

Amid cheers from the crowd, the bulldozer returned to the police station.A call from district police chief Prachi Singh finally broke the deadlock.Kotwali police station wasn’t the only official structure to be targeted for encroachment.

Musk, in a post on X, emphasized the importance of supporting diverse viewpoints within the legal framework of countries.“This platform really is meant to support all viewpoints within the bounds of the laws of countries, even those of people with whom I vehemently disagree and personally dislike.If that doesn’t seem to be happening, please yell at me (ideally on X),” Musk wrote, reiterating his commitment to free speech despite disagreements.The discussion was sparked by Zuckerberg's recent letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan. In the letter, Zuckerberg detailed how the Biden administration had repeatedly pressured Meta to remove various types of coronavirus-related content, including satire. This pressure, according to Zuckerberg, led to significant internal frustration at Meta.Jordan, who shared screenshots of Zuckerberg’s letter, used the information to highlight alleged attempts by the White House to control content on social media platforms . The letter adds fuel to ongoing debates about the balance between content moderation and free speech.Mark Zuckerberg recently made statements that have stirred significant controversy, particularly in light of the approaching2024 presidential election . In remarks to the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg alleged that the Biden administration exerted pressure on Meta to censor specific Covid-19 content, including satire and humour, CNN reported. This assertion comes amid ongoing Republican complaints about Meta’s policies and claims of government overreach during the pandemic.In a statement released on Monday, Zuckerberg detailed his experience with Biden administration officials. “In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain Covid-19 content,” Zuckerberg said. He expressed regret for not being more vocal against this pressure.Former President Donald Trump quickly seized on Zuckerberg’s statements to bolster his narrative of a rigged 2020 election. On Truth Social, Trump claimed, “Zuckerberg admits that the White House pushed to SUPPRESS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY (& much more!) IN OTHER WORDS, THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS RIGGED.”The House Judiciary Committee, led by Republicans, used Zuckerberg’s letter to criticize President Biden and Vice President Harris, posting it on social media with a focus on claims that the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor content and suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. The committee’s statement on X emphasized three points as victories for free speech: “1. Biden-Harris Admin 'pressured' Facebook to censor Americans. 2. Facebook censored Americans. 3. Facebook throttled the Hunter Biden laptop story.”Zuckerberg’s statements are also notable in the context of his recent decisions regarding political funding. He announced he would cease supporting election-related efforts, following criticism that his $400 million donation, known as ""Zuckerbucks,"" was biased towards Biden. “I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another,” Zuckerberg said.In a further controversial move, Zuckerberg admitted that Meta’s decision to limit the sharing of the New York Post’s October 2020 story about Hunter Biden’s laptop was a mistake. He conceded that the reporting was not Russian disinformation and should not have been demoted.According to Bloomberg, Zuckerberg’s praise for Trump’s reaction to an assassination attempt as “badass” and his comments on reducing political content on Meta platforms suggest a possible attempt to offer Republicans political leverage while demonstrating neutrality. Zuckerberg also indicated that Meta’s involvement in the election would be reduced compared to previous cycles.As the 2024 election approaches, these developments continue to fuel the debate over social media’s role in political discourse and the influence of tech giants on public perception and policy.","Elon Musk has weighed in on Mark Zuckerberg's claims of government pressure.

'Duty to warn': Canadian police alert aide to slain Sikh separatist Nijjar of increased threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/duty-to-warn-canadian-police-alert-aide-to-slain-sikh-separatist-nijjar-of-increased-threats/articleshow/112852400.cms,"Canadian police have issued a warning to an aide of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar , who was assassinated in British Columbia last year, due to increased threats against his life. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , a prominent Sikh separatist, revealed on Tuesday that authorities in Ontario, in collaboration with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), have provided Inderjeet Singh Gosal with a ""duty to warn"" notice.Gosal, who was an aide to Nijjar at the time of his killing in June 2023, received the warning this week. Nijjar’s assassination has sparked significant controversy, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September 2023 citing credible allegations of potential Indian government involvement. The Canadian police have since charged four individuals in connection with the murder. India, however, has denied any role in the incident.Adding to the tension, the FBI is currently investigating a drive-by shooting on August 11 that targeted a California activist closely associated with Nijjar. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining the case as part of a broader investigation into possible threats against Sikh separatists.India has accused Canada of providing refuge to Sikh separatists advocating for the creation of Khalistan, an independent state to be carved out of Punjab, India. In response to the threats, Gosal said, “I’ve been informed by Canadian officials about the threats to my life. However, my commitment to the liberation of Punjab from Indian occupation remains unwavering.”Neither the RCMP nor Ontario police were available for immediate comment. The office of Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who oversees law enforcement, declined to provide a statement.In a related development, in June 2023, the FBI thwarted an alleged assassination attempt on Pannun, with Indian national Nikhil Gupta charged for attempting to orchestrate the murder under the direction of an Indian intelligence official.","Inderjeet Singh Gosal was an aide to Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Reflections and decisions

Unreleased footage from January 7, 2021, revealed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s intense condemnation of former President Donald Trump following the Capitol riot . The video obtained by Politico, was captured by her daughter, filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, and provided to the House Committee on Administration by HBO. The footage showed Pelosi grappling with the aftermath of the attack.In a candid moment, Pelosi is seen reflecting on the events of January 6 , saying, “I just feel sick about what he did to the Capitol and the country today,” and insisted, “He’s got to pay a price for that.” The footage highlighted Pelosi’s immediate outrage and her determination to hold Trump accountable for the riot, as reported by Politico.In the early hours of January 7, after being evacuated from the Capitol, Pelosi is seen in the back of her SUV, visibly exhausted and distressed. “I just feel sick about what he did to the Capitol and the country today,” Pelosi said. “He’s got to pay a price for that.” The footage showed Pelosi's immediate outrage and her determination to address the aftermath of the riot.The footage documented the chaotic moments following Pelosi’s evacuation from the Capitol. As she was whisked away by Capitol Police, Pelosi expressed frustration over the lack of preparedness and the failure to anticipate the attack. “How many times did the members ask, ‘Are we prepared? Are we prepared?’ We’re not prepared for the worst,” Pelosi criticized. Her frustration was further fueled by the realization that the pro-Trump mob had already breached the Capitol.As Pelosi and other congressional leaders huddled at Fort McNair, the footage revealed their discussions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and others expressed frustration over Trump’s video statement that praised the rioters and perpetuated false claims about the election. “We shouldn’t let him off the hook, Nancy. We issued a statement saying he’s got to make a statement. He comes up with this BS,” Schumer said. Pelosi responded with resolve, describing Trump’s actions as “insurrection” and demanding accountability.The footage also documented Pelosi’s strategic planning as she prepared a forceful statement condemning Trump as a threat to democracy. In a conversation with her aides, Pelosi debated whether to publicly call for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, ultimately deciding to focus her message on Trump. “I think our focus has to be on the president. Let’s not divert ourselves,” Pelosi instructed.The footage captured Pelosi’s critical approach to the Capitol security failures and her discussions about the fate of key security officials. The House Administration Oversight Subcommittee, which is leading the January 6 investigation, has criticized Pelosi for shifting focus to Trump rather than addressing security lapses.As the footage concluded, Pelosi is seen navigating the aftermath of the riot, including discussions about Capitol security and the potential resignation of officials. Despite internal debates and criticisms, Pelosi remained steadfast in her determination to address the riot’s causes and hold those responsible accountable.","Footage from January 7, 2021, revealed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s intense condemnation of former President Donald Trump.

By May, it was declared that the updated rocket launcher would be deployed to units of the Korean People's Army between 2024 to 2026 as replacement equipment.Inter-Korean relations are currently at a very low point, with Pyongyang designating South Korea as its ""principal enemy."" The North has closed agencies dedicated to reunification and has issued warnings over territorial infringements.The test-firing by North Korea coincided with major annual joint military drills by South Korea and the United States, which ran until Thursday.

Analysts suggest that North Korea might be testing and increasing the production of artillery and cruise missiles possibly for this purpose.North Korea, historically infuriated by joint US-South Korean military exercises, decries these drills as rehearsals for invasion.

Sparks after entering the Capitol fought with US Capitol Police Sergeant Victor Nichols.Nichols while testifying at trial in Washington, said he ""acted like a green light for everybody behind him, and everyone followed right behind him.""The sentence deviated from the federal sentencing guidelines, which suggested a prison term ranging from 15 to 21 months. Meanwhile, a probation officer had recommended a sentence of 21 months, according to Judge Kelly.Earlier this month, United States District Judge Timothy Kelly dismissed the count of obstruction of an official proceeding against Sparks at the request of prosecutors.

However, during the sentencing on Tuesday, Judge Kelly stated that he believed Sparks's intent was to obstruct the certification process.Sparks while addressing Judge Kelly expressed his belief that the 2020 presidential election was ""taken"" and that the United States is currently ""in tyranny.""

Harris is expected to address several policy shifts that have emerged since her nomination, including her changing stances on fracking, border security, and private health insurance. Her previous progressive positions on these topics as a 2019 presidential candidate have been a point of contention.Additionally, Harris may face questions about her awareness of President Biden’s mental decline, despite her public defense of him following a contentious debate performance.Walz, who will share the spotlight with Harris, is anticipated to face inquiries about his military service record and the left-wing policies implemented during his tenure as Minnesota's governor.CNN's Dana Bash, who moderated the June presidential debate marking Biden's campaign’s decline, will conduct the interview. The debate was a turning point, leading to increased scrutiny of Biden’s performance and subsequent withdrawal.Former President Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, have criticized Harris and Walz for their media avoidance.

Previous incidents

A pro-Palestinian campus group at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, has alleged that the medical school deleted photos of Arab students from multiple social media platforms . The images, taken at a school event earlier this year, included students wearing keffiyehs , which symbolise solidarity with Palestinians. These photos were deleted from Flickr, a photo-sharing site.The university’s Feinberg School of Medicine also reportedly removed photos from its official Instagram page.The Students for Justice in Palestine chapter has demanded a public apology and an investigation into the removal. The group criticised the university, stating that Palestinian medical students and their families are being targeted for celebrating their achievements publicly.University spokesperson Hilary Hurd Anyaso said that the photos were removed to protect students from potential doxing, though it was not clarified if any students were actually doxxed or endangered, according to media reports. Anyaso emphasised that the decision was made out of concern for student safety and reaffirmed the university's commitment to diversity and inclusion.Last November, three Palestinian college students were shot in Burlington, Vermont; one was paralyzed, and there were concerns that the incident might have been a hate crime.Additionally, ""doxxing trucks"" displaying the names and faces of pro-Palestinian student demonstrators were seen on several campuses last fall.The Council on American-Islamic Relations reported a record number of discrimination complaints in 2023, with a notable portion related to educational settings. Jewish students also faced a rise in antisemitic incidents following the Hamas attacks on October 7, according to the Anti-Defamation League.","Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, has deleted photos of Arab students from multiple social media platforms.

The incidents involved a pilgrimage group on their way to Iran and another near the town of Azad Pattan on the border between Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.The first accident claimed the lives of 23 individuals when their bus plunged into a ravine near Azad Pattan.Sameena Khan, head of Tehsil Headquarter Hospital in the town of Kahuta, confirmed the recovery of 23 bodies from the crash site.""I have lost three members of my family,"" Tara Zafar, who went to the hospital after hearing about the accident, shared. ""My father, sister and one-year-old nephew were among the dead. I hoped that at least one of them had survived. It's doomsday for my family.""Umar Farooq, a senior government official from Sudhanoti district, where the bus started its journey, also confirmed the death toll from the crash site in a phone call with AFP.In the second incident, 12 men died when their bus, heading towards Balochistan , crashed into a ravine on the Makran Coastal Highway after being prevented from crossing into Iran. Aslam Bangulzai, a police official at the scene, explained that the death toll could rise as an army crane was on its way to lift the bus from the ravine and check if passengers were pinned underneath.""This is a particularly treacherous tract of road, with many twists and turns. The driver was speeding and the bus fell into a deep ravine,"" Bangulzai added.The accident occurred in a mountainous area, approximately 100 kilometers from the nearest town of Uthal and 500 kilometers from the Iran border town of Pishin. Hamood Ur Rehman, a senior government official in the nearby district of Gwadar, stated that the bus was carrying pilgrims on their way to the Arbaeen pilgrimage but was turned back at the Iran border due to document issues.Road accidents with high fatalities are common in Pakistan due to generally poor safety measures, inadequate driver training, and often decrepit transport infrastructure.The bodies of 28 pilgrims who died in a bus crash in Iran were returned to Pakistan on Saturday. The bus was carrying 51 Pakistani pilgrims who were passing through Iran to attend the Arbaeen commemoration in Iraq, one of the largest events in the Shiite calendar, when it overturned and caught fire in front of a checkpoint in Yazd province on Tuesday night, according to Iranian state TV reports.","At least 35 people were killed in two separate bus accidents in Pakistan on Sunday.
