"Faridabad Suicide: Before suicide horror, a calm & routine morning, parathas, talk of a family outing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/faridabad/before-faridabad-suicide-horror-a-calm-routine-morning-parathas-talk-of-a-family-outing/articleshow/121790617.cms,"The spot where Mehto waited with his four sons till the train crushed them; (right) the room where he lived with his family





FARIDABAD: There was no foreboding of the extraordinary day that would reduce the Mehtos from a family of six to one.Not even that morning. June 10 bore the stamp of routine. The boys took their usual morning baths before the heatwave made an oven of their room. Their mother made parathas for breakfast. Their father, Manoj Mehto, lazed, ambled around the alley, spoke to a few neighbours. Like he did on days he did not go to work, which would be twice or thrice a week.""It was a normal Tuesday morning,"" Preeti told TOI on Wednesday, alone in a house - in fact, a room- where four boys and two adults packed in, each with a few inches marked out to sleep or sit, bedroom, living room and kitchen rolled into one.The little room in Subhash Colony would allow no secrets, at least not within its confines. As people living in other such dwellings on the road put it, it's so cramped that even thoughts could get heard.And yet, the storm raging in 36-year-old Mehto's mind made no noise. Preeti has to think hard to remember if anything was amiss. Yes, it was odd of him to put on new clothes. But it had seemed in tune with what Preeti read as a jovial mood and a desire to take the boys out to a park.""You come too,"" he insisted to her, speaking of a 'family outing'.""But I wasn't feeling well and had a lot of work to do at home, so I refused. I told him to take the children out. They all left and never returned...,"" a distraught Preeti said as neighbours crowded the house with one question - why?Preeti did not have an answer.Manoj had not gone to the park. He bought chips and cola and headed for the railway tracks nearby. The five of them sat on the tracks under the Elson Chowk flyover. The boys had no inkling of what was to happen. For close to an hour, they sat there. One of the most horrifying deaths the country has seen unfolded next as a train - Golden Temple Express - ran them over. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on firm, making sure all five of them would be right in line when the train came. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders and held Pawan (10) and Kaaro (7) by their arms.Police have initiated an inquest and are still searching for a motive. After questioning different people, police officers said they had come to know that Manoj might have had some ""trust issues"" and was particularly peeved with a neighbour of Preeti's parents back at their home in Bihar's Lakhisarai who helped take her messages to them.""Preeti's parents did not have mobile phones, so she would call the neighbour, a man she refers to as a 'cousin', and request him to help her get in touch with them. There was nothing more to it,"" said Rajender Singh, in charge of the railway police post in Ballabgarh.The couple's neighbours in Subhash Colony said they hadn't heard any arguments between Manoj and Preeti. Preeti told police she didn't have any recent disagreement with Manoj. The two had fallen in love and got married 11 years ago.""We got married, and my sister married Manoj's brother. We shifted here (Faridabad) three years ago, and I stayed at home because he always asked me not to take a job and raise his kids well,"" Preeti said.Seema Devi, a neighbour who visited the couple's house on Wednesday, said she didn't know the family, but came to convey her condolences. ""We are all shattered by this very disturbing incident. I came to pay condolences and wanted to know what led the man to make such a decision,"" she said.A police officer said Mehto's and the boys' bodies are currently at the mortuary of BK Civil Hospital. ""Manoj's brother requested us to wait for the autopsy till he arrives in Faridabad. He will reach on Thursday, after which the post-mortem examination will be conducted,"" he said.","Manoj Mehto waited with his four sons till the train crushed them. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders.

Poll Do you believe international cooperation is effective in tackling cross-border crime? Yes, it helps bring justice beyond borders No, legal and political barriers make it difficult

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar

Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

He is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Police say Akhtar planned the killing, managed finances through more than 10 bank accounts, and coordinated with other accused.

He worked closely with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and helped arrange weapons and shelter for the attackers.

Akhtar reportedly left Mumbai a month before the murder to avoid raising suspicion.

He is linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang.

Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol Bishnoi.

Zeeshan Akhtar has been detained in Canada in connection with the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique. Akhtar was reportedly held on the basis of an Interpol notice and has been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Baba Siddique, 66, was shot dead on October 12 last year outside his son's office in Bandra (East), Mumbai. Three assailants carried out the attack. His son had alleged that a builder lobby involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project was responsible, but police ruled out this angle. Instead, their chargesheet pointed to Lawrence Bishnoi's Canada-based brother Anmol as the mastermind, linking the murder to Siddique's alleged connections with Dawood Ibrahim and actor Salman Khan.So far, 26 people have been arrested from different parts of the country, including Pune, Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich, Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat. They include Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots. All 26 are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).","Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

SRINAGAR: Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention calling for the restoration of Article 370 and initiation of dialogue with Pakistan.The convention stood out as a rare political event in Kashmir Valley, where even most of the regional parties have largely shifted discourse to demanding the restoration of statehood rather than raising the issue of restoring J&K’s special status.Addressing party workers at the event, titled ‘Convention for the Restoration of Legitimate Constitutional Rights of the People of Jammu and Kashmir’, CPM general secretary M Alexander Baby said the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to J&K, amounted to betrayal. “Before adding it into the Constitution of India, Article 370 was thoroughly deliberated upon and agreed to,” Baby said.He hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for claiming that the abrogation of Article 370 had brought peace and development to Kashmir.Baby, accompanied by several party MPs and other functionaries, also visited border areas in Uri to assess the destruction caused by Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.He said the compensation offered to affected residents was inadequate. “Govt is providing only Rs 1.3 lakh for damaged houses and residential structures. That amount is meagre,” he said, adding that party MPs would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha.The CPM leader, who also met family members of Adil Shah, the ponywallah killed in Pahalgam terror attack, said Kashmiris had been fighting terrorism for years, but the current administration had marginalised elected representatives of the state. During the security review meetings, it’s the LG, a nominee of the Centre, who chaired the meeting, while the elected chief minister Omar Abdullah was excluded, Baby said, adding that “this only emboldens the terrorists”.Baby asserted that terrorism must be fought, but war was not a solution. “Military options are limited. On May 7, certain steps were taken, but we must stop there and begin negotiations,” he said, calling for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Rejecting any third-party intervention, he said US President Donald Trump shouldn’t have any role.CPM leader from Kashmir, M Y Tarigami, also criticised the central govt for bifurcating J&K and stripping it of statehood and special status. “This is the only region in the country where such a reversal (from state to Union Territory) has happened. Elsewhere, UTs have been upgraded to full states,” Tarigami said.","Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention.

Rajkot mourns demise of ex-CM Rupani, its friendly neighbour

GANDHINAGAR: For Gujarat's former chief minister Vijay Rupani , the number 1206 was a symbol of fortune, a silent companion through the years. He believed in it with a tender faith. The registration plates of all his vehicles - scooters and cars - had 1206 on them. Friends say it had always been his lucky charm.But fate gave it a cruel twist. On June 12 - 12/06 - the same number that followed him for decades marked the day his journey ended. Rupani was aboard the AI flight that crashed moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad. He was en route to London to meet his wife and daughter. He never arrived. The ex-CM, now the party in charge of Punjab, had put off his visit to the UK from June 5 to 12, owing to Ludhiana West bypoll on June 19, said Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar.""This is very unfortunate.

The identity of the deceased was yet to be confirmed.The victim was riding towards Porur when the structure, estimated to weigh between 50 and 100 tonnes, came crashing down. It had been installed as part of the elevated metro rail line and spanned between two piers to support future tracks.Rescue teams brought in heavy equipment to remove the debris. This resulted in a heavy traffic pile up on the Poonamallee-St Thomas Mount Road.According to a statement from Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), two I-girders erected near the L&T head office main gate in Manapakkam collapsed after one of the supporting A-frames slipped.I-girders are long, beam-like elements, designed to bear heavy loads. They are a key component in elevated metro rail corridors, typically laid between concrete piers to support track slabs above.The A-frame, which failed in this instance, is a temporary steel structure used during construction to hold the girder in place until it is permanently secured. Any failure in the A-frame’s grip or alignment can cause the entire girder to dislodge, especially during the early stages of erection.“A thorough investigation is forthcoming,"" CMRL said in its statement.","The victim was riding towards Porur when the structure, estimated to weigh between 50 and 100 tonnes, came crashing down.

Israel launched a ""preemptive strike"" on Iran, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites. The Iranian state-run news agency acknowledged the explosions. Air-raid sirens preventatively rang out in Israel.The strikes occurred amid heightened tensions regarding Iran's nuclear programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors issued its first censure against Iran in 20 years on Thursday. Iran responded by announcing plans for a third enrichment facility and upgrading its centrifuges.Also read: Operation 'Rising Lion': What nuclear facility did Israel strike in Iran? Why this site was chosen Israel maintains its stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons, while Tehran denies such intentions despite issuing contradictory statements.According to the AFP, Iran Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami killed in Israeli attack. Tasnim news agency, a local media outlet, stated: ""Major General Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was martyred in the Israeli regime's attack on the IRGC headquarters.""The Revolutionary Guard maintains significant influence within Iran's theocratic structure and holds authority over the nation's ballistic missile capabilities, Times of Israel reported.Also read: Operation Rising Lion: Iran's key uranium enrichment facility hit 'several times' - what we know so far Israeli forces report that the initial strikes also resulted in the deaths of Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's military chief, along with several high-ranking military officials and prominent nuclear scientists.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated via YouTube that Israel conducted ""a targeted military operation roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,"" indicating operations would persist until the threat subsides. He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”Iran warned Israel after it launched ""Operation Rising Lion"" on Thursday, said they will face a “severe punishment.”Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,” Khamenei says.“With this crime, the Zionist regime has set itself for a bitter and painful fate and it will definitely receive it,” Khamenei says.Defence minister Israel Katz issued warnings about potential missile and drone attacks, declaring an emergency situation requiring adherence to protective measures. “In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement.The statement added that Katz “signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.”“It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it saidSecretary Rubio confirmed Israel's independent action, stating the US received prior notification of strikes deemed necessary for Israeli self-defence. He cautioned Iran against targeting US interests.In a statement, he said: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense.

Reed further stated: ""I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.""Numerous commercial aircraft were traversing Iranian airspace during the strikes, as evidenced by flight tracking data.After the Israeli strike commenced, some aircraft continued their routes through Iranian airspace, whilst others swiftly adjusted their flight paths to exit the region.Several countries had previously restricted their aircraft from flying over Iran due to ongoing regional tensions.A senior Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, confirmed that Israel has conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear and military installations, though specific locations were not disclosed.During the operational briefing, the official outlined three primary concerns regarding Iran: They claim Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons, despite US intelligence assessments indicating otherwise. Additionally, Iran's extensive ballistic missile arsenal and its distribution of weaponry to regional groups like Hezbollah and Hamas were cited as significant threats.During the Tehran explosions, Donald Trump was observed socialising with Congressional members on the White House lawn. He continued meeting and photographing with guests, though it was not clear whether he had been briefed about the situation.Earlier that day, Trump had commented that whilst an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities was not immediate, it remained a strong possibility.The US government had taken precautionary measures, including withdrawing diplomatic staff from Baghdad and offering evacuation options to US military families across the Middle East region.After the Israel attacked Iran, the oil prices surged over six percent on Friday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said Israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against Iran, striking 'at the heart' of Tehran's ballistic missile programme. The Israeli PM said the attack was to roll back the threat to Israel's ""very survival"".Netanyahu said Israel's attack on Iran would ""continue for as many days as it takes"" after Israel announced it had carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites.""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement, naming the operation ""Rising Lion"", reported news agency AFP.""We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility at Natanz... We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme,"" he said, adding that Israel had also hit Iranian nuclear scientists ""working on the Iranian bomb,"" he said.""This military operation aims to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as necessary to eliminate that threat. For decades, the tyrants in Tehran have openly and brazenly called for the destruction of Israel,"" he said.Israeli PM claimed that Iran has produced ""enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs"" and that it could produce ""a nuclear weapon in a very short time"".""They have backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs - nine. In recent months, Iran has taken steps it had never taken before - steps toward weaponising that enriched uranium. If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be within a year. It could even be within a few months - less than a year. This poses a clear and present danger to Israel’s very existence. Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime,” Netanyahu said in an address shortly after the ""Operation Rising Lion"".The attack comes hours after Iran announced that it has built and plans to activate a third nuclear enrichment facility, escalating tensions with the United Nations just after the UN’s atomic watchdog censured the country for failing to meet its nonproliferation commitments aimed at preventing the development of nuclear weapons.""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organisation said in a joint statement.The timing also coincides with the efforts of the United States to actively lead negotiations with Tehran aimed at reaching a deal to restrict Iran’s capacity to develop nuclear weapons.The Israeli strike followed months of friction between US President Donald Trump and Netanyahu over how best to confront Iran. Netanyahu has consistently pushed for military action as a way to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions.On Thursday, Trump reiterated his opposition to an Israeli attack, warning that such a move could derail diplomatic efforts. ""I think it would blow it,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged the complexity of the situation, adding, ""It might help it actually, but it could also blow it.""Earlier, Trump had dismissed an Israeli plan to launch a strike against Iran, making it clear that he wanted time to pursue a negotiated settlement with Tehran. Just two weeks ago, he said he had cautioned Netanyahu against attacking while talks were under way.However, those negotiations have stalled in recent weeks, and it remains uncertain how much effort Trump made to prevent this latest escalation.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday said that the strikes by Israel were ""unilateral"" and that US' priority is now to protect the American forces in the region.Rubio said that Israel said that the strikes were done in the spirit of self-defence.He said that Iran must not harm US interests or personnel.In a statement, Rubio said, ""Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense.

Rubio says U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes against Iran





The United States has made it clear that it is not involved in Israel’s latest strikes on Iran and has warned Tehran against targeting American forces in response. The statement came from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio late Thursday, just hours after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran.""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,"" Rubio said. He added, ""Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.""Israel's attack caused multiple explosions across Tehran early Friday, raising fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Following the strikes, Rubio confirmed that Israel had informed Washington in advance, calling the action necessary for its self-defence. According to Rubio, Israel claimed the strikes were necessary to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear ambitions.The airstrikes came shortly after US president Donald Trump advised both countries against such action, saying it could damage the chances of reaching a peaceful agreement. Talks between Washington and Tehran on Iran’s nuclear programme were scheduled to enter a sixth round this Sunday in Oman.The US department of State had urged American citizens to stay alert and follow local news amid rising tensions in the Middle East.In a post on X, the department had said, “Due to high tensions in the Middle East, the security environment remains complex and can change quickly. We remind US citizens in Israel and the broader region to remain cautious and monitor the news for updates.”The Israeli military expects its operation targeting Iran’s nuclear programme and long-range missile sites to continue for several days, according to The Times of Israel. The IDF is bracing for heavy retaliation from Iran following tonight’s airstrikes.“At the end of the operation, there will be no nuclear threat from Iran,” military officials said. They added, “We are in a window of strategic opportunities. We have reached the point of no return, and there is no choice but to act now.”",Rubio says U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes against Iran.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

The Senegalese Italian TikTok sensation and one of the most-followed influencers globally was detained in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. The 25-year-old arrived in the US on April 30 and was held at Harry Reid International Airport on Friday, according to an ICE spokesperson. Although detained, Lame was not issued a deportation order. Instead, he voluntarily left the country, an option that allows individuals to exit without a formal deportation mark on their immigration records. This could be crucial in avoiding long-term re-entry bans, which can stretch up to 10 years.Lame's detainment comes in the middle of US President Donald Trump's intensifying clampdown on immigration, which has triggered protests across major US cities. Recent US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles, combined with the controversial deployment of the National Guard, have reignited debates over the administration’s use of executive power. In California, tensions escalated as tear gas and flash-bangs were used on demonstrators outside federal buildings. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned Trump’s actions, calling them “unconstitutional” and vowing to challenge the federal government in court.Just weeks ago, Lame walked the red carpet at the Met Gala in New York City, one of the fashion world’s biggest events. His visit to the US, however, was unexpectedly cut short due to his visa situation. While his exit from the country was amicable and without legal penalties, the incident highlights growing concerns around immigration enforcement and how even international celebrities can get caught in the crossfire of broader political battles.According to the reports, Lame has not publicly commented on the incident, but his team is expected to clarify his future travel plans soon. Whether he will return to the US in the near future remains uncertain, especially given the increasing scrutiny at borders under the Trump administration’s renewed immigration agenda.Born in Senegal and raised in Chivasso, Italy, Khaby Lame shot to fame during the COVID-19 lockdowns. After losing his factory job in 2020, he began posting videos silently mocking over-engineered life hacks. His expressive, wordless reactions quickly resonated with millions, propelling him to stardom.According to the reports, Khaby lame has more than 160 million followers on TikTok, Lame is now the platform’s most-followed creator. His meteoric rise has led to major brand collaborations including a long-term deal with Hugo Boss and prestigious accolades.

TOI correspondent from Washington:





Pakistani expat supporters of former PM Imran Khan are lining up protests against the country's de facto military ruler, ""Field Marshal"" Asim Munir, who is scheduled to arrive in Washington DC on Thursday to attend a military parade to celebrate the 250th anniversary of US Army.""General Asim Munir and his regime have committed some of the worst human rights abuses in Pakistan’s history. Pakistani-Americans from across the country will travel to Washington this Saturday, the 14th, to demand a lifting of the martial law, an end to human rights violations, and restoration of the constitution,"" the US wing of the Imran Khan's PTI said in a statement.Munir is a guest of the Centcom commander Gen Michael Kurilla, who gave glowing testimonials to Pakistan as a ""phenomenal partner"" in counter-terrorism at a congressional hearing earlier this week, underscoring rejuvenated ties between Washington and Islamabad. The remarks came in the face of Pakistan's terrorist depredations in the US and in India, where officials attribute the uptick in terror attacks in Kashmir, including the Pahalgam carnage, to Munir's hardline policies aimed at keeping the military relevant.Once a ""frontline ally"" and a ""major non-Nato partner"", Pakistan's ties with US have been moribund for almost 15 years following a tactical alliance during the Bush presidency to vanquish Al Qaeda and ISIS, even as Washington forged strategic ties with New Delhi with a civilian nuclear deal and began to view India as a counterweight to China.Successive US Presidents after Bush, including Obama, Trump in his first term, and Biden, largely ignored the country. But ties have rebounded dramatically over the past 15 weeks after the Pakistani establishment reached out to Trump surrogates to play a ""get out of jail"" card, dangling lucrative contracts in mineral exploration and cryptocurrency to Trump surrogates to make inroads into Washington.Among them is Gentry Beach, a Texas-based businessman, hedge fund manager, and CEO/co-founder of Highground Holdings and Valence Chemicals, who is a longtime friend and associate of Donald Trump Jr., having met him at the Wharton School of Business in the 1990s.Beach led a US business investor delegation to Pakistan soon after the Trump II inauguration to explore investments in luxury real estate, mining, energy, technology, with his company White Bridge Mining, signing an agreement for exploration of gold and other minerals. Following meetings with top Pakistani leaders in Islamabad and Dubai, Beach began talking up Pakistan in Washington, calling it an ""amazing country"" and echoing Islamabad's talking points that it has been on the ""frontlines in the war on terrorism"" and ""sacrificed so much for America. ""Trump himself began taking a charitable view of Pakistan after having lambasted it during his first term. ""The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” he tweeted in January 2018. He also suspended $1.3 billion in security assistance to Pakistan, citing its failure to crack down on terrorist networks.But amid scuttlebutt that Pakistan had bought its way back into Washington's good books, the US President took a more benign view of Islamabad, asserting on June 6, “Pakistan has very strong leadership. Some people won’t like when I say that, but it is what it is.""","Pakistani expat supporters of former PM Imran Khan are lining up protests against the country's de facto military ruler, ""Field Marshal"" Asim Munir.

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami was killed in Israel's 'targeted military operation', news agency AFP reported citing Iranian media reports.As the Commander-in-Chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami was heading one of the most powerful military organisations in Iran.Born in 1960 in Golpayegan, Iran, Salami joined the IRGC shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and quickly rose through the ranks, gaining prominence during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.Known for his hardline views and strong loyalty to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Salami was a key figure in shaping Iran’s military strategy, particularly its regional influence and missile development programs.Prior to becoming the IRGC chief in April 2019, he served as the organisation’s deputy commander for over a decade.Salami was widely recognised for his aggressive rhetoric against Israel, the United States, and Gulf Arab states, often emphasising Iran’s military readiness and deterrence capabilities.Under his leadership, the IRGC expanded its missile arsenal and strengthened ties with proxy groups across the Middle East, playing a central role in Iran’s foreign policy and regional security agenda.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said Israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against Iran, striking 'at the heart' of Tehran's ballistic missile programme.

Raj is the mastermind,” Syiem said, adding that all the five accused _Sonam, Vishal Chauhan, Raj Kushwaha, Akash Rajput and Anand Kurmi _ said the plan was hatched in Indore 11 days before Raja and Sonam’s wedding.“They were all friends and one of them was Raj’s cousin. It was not a contract killing. They committed the crime as a favour to Raj,” said the SP.“They wanted to get rid of Raja in various places. First, they tried to eliminate him somewhere in Guwahati, which did not materialize. They then wanted to eliminate him in Nongriat. But they didn't find a place to dispose the body. They then wanted to do it between Mawalakhyat and Weisawdong but that also didn't happen.Finally, they did it in Weisawdong falls,” the SP said.Investigations revealed how the suspects planned Sonam’s disappearance back in February, way before Raja and Sonam tied the knot.The three people involved in the crime arrived in Guwahati way before Sonam did, the SP said. “The initial plan was to eliminate Raja in Guwahati itself. Since they were unable to execute the plan in Guwahati, Sonam decided to travel to Shillong and then to Sohra. Later, they decided to execute the plan in Nongriat,” Vivek Syiem said.“All the accused took turns to hack Raja Raghuvanshi. Then they threw the body into the gorge. They left the place immediately after. Akash discarded his shirt and put on the raincoat Sonam was wearing.”The police claimed that in February Sonam and Raj had initially thought of ways where Sonam would disappear and probably escape the marriage with Raja. “One plan was to make her get washed by ariver. Another plan was murder somebody, put it on a scooty and burn that person's body and later claim to be that of Sonam’s,” the SP said. But when these ideas could not be implemented, they focussed on eliminating Raja after the wedding, police said.","The five accused have all confessed to the murder of Raja Raghuvanshi.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said that Israel struck Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz.Netanyahu said the Israeli forces also attacked Tehran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb and ballistic missile programme.""We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponisation programme. We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme,"" Netanyahu said in an address shortly after ""Operation Rising Lion"".According to news agency AFP, Iranian state television also reported that an explosion was heard at a key uranium enrichment site in central Iran.""New explosion heard at Natanz uranium enrichment facility"" in Isfahan province, an Iranian broadcaster also reported, showing thick black smoke rising from the facility.The Israeli PM said Iran's ballistic missiles ""could carry nuclear payload"", threatening the lives of millions. He said, ""This is an intolerable threat. It must be stopped.""""Last year, Iran fired 300 ballistic missiles at Israel. Each of these missiles carries a tonne of explosives and threatens the lives of hundreds of people.Soon, those missiles could carry a nuclear payload, threatening the lives not of hundreds, but of millions. Iran is gearing up to produce 10,000 of those ballistic missiles within three years. Now just imagine, imagine 10,000 tonnes of TNT landing on a country the size of New Jersey. This is an intolerable threat. It must be stopped,"" the Israeli PM said.Netanyahu said Iran's ""new plan to destroy Israel"" involved surrounding the country with regional proxies and launching direct attacks, including the October 7 incident.""But the people of Israel, the soldiers of Israel rose like lions to defend our country. We crushed Hamas. We devastated Hezbollah. We hit Iranian proxies in Syria and Yemen. And when Iran directly attacked us twice last year, we struck back inside Iran itself. Yet in defending ourselves, we also defend others,"" he was quoted as saying by the news agency AP.The strikes hit Iran’s capital, Tehran, early Friday morning, with loud explosions echoing across the city.The Israeli PM said the attack was to roll back the threat to Israel's ""very survival"". Netanyahu said Israel's attack on Iran would ""continue for as many days as it takes"" after Israel announced it had carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites.The Isreali Defence Force (IDF) said it ""has the obligation to act in defense of the civilians of Israel and will continue to do so"".""The Iranian regime has been working for decades to obtain a nuclear weapon. The world has attempted every possible diplomatic path to stop it, but the regime has refused to stop,"" IDF said.The Natanz nuclear facility is one of Iran’s most critical and well-known nuclear sites, playing a central role in the country's uranium enrichment program. Located about 250 kilometres south of Tehran, Natanz houses thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium, a process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or, if further enriched, material for nuclear weapons.The facility has been at the heart of international concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions for years, making it a frequent focus of diplomatic negotiations, United Nations inspections, and covert sabotage operations. Natanz has also been the target of multiple cyberattacks and suspected Israeli-led operations aimed at slowing Iran’s nuclear progress.Its significance stems not only from its scale and technological capacity but also from its symbolic status as a key pillar of Iran’s nuclear strategy. Any disruption at Natanz can severely impact Iran’s enrichment capabilities and serves as a powerful lever in the ongoing standoff between Tehran and Western powers over nuclear proliferation.In 2021, the Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010 and widely believed to be a joint US-Israeli creation, once disrupted and destroyed Iranian centrifuges at Natanz amid an earlier period of Western fears about Tehran's program.Natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July that authorities later described as sabotage. Later, Iran rebuilt that facility deep inside a nearby mountain.Located approximately 100 kilometres southwest of Tehran, the Fordo enrichment site is another key part of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Unlike Natanz, Fordo is smaller in scale but is heavily fortified. Built deep within a mountain and shielded by anti-aircraft defences, the facility seems specifically constructed to survive potential aerial assaults. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, construction at Fordo began around 2007, though Iran only disclosed the site’s existence in 2009 after it had been detected by Western intelligence agencies.The Bushehr nuclear power plant, situated along the Persian Gulf roughly 750 kilometres south of Tehran, is Iran’s only operational commercial nuclear power station. The plant’s construction was initially started in the mid-1970s under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s regime.Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the facility suffered damage during the Iran-Iraq war. Its completion was later facilitated by Russian assistance. Bushehr runs on Russian-supplied uranium and is under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran is currently working on two additional reactors at the same site.Located about 250 kilometres southwest of Tehran, the Arak facility houses a heavy water reactor. Heavy water is used to cool nuclear reactors, but a key concern is that this process also produces plutonium, which can be utilised to develop nuclear weapons. This provides Iran with an alternative route to a bomb, separate from uranium enrichment, should it decide to pursue that path. Under the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, Iran committed to redesigning the Arak reactor to reduce these proliferation risks.The Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center is located around 350 kilometers southeast of Tehran and serves as a major hub for Iran’s nuclear research and development. The center employs thousands of nuclear scientists and hosts multiple research reactors supplied by China. Additionally, it includes a range of laboratories that support various aspects of Iran’s atomic program, making it a key part of the country’s nuclear infrastructure.Situated within the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, the Tehran Research Reactor is a significant element of the country's civilian nuclear activities. The reactor was originally provided by the United States in 1967 as part of the Cold War-era ""Atoms for Peace"" initiative. Initially designed to use highly enriched uranium, the reactor was later modified to operate on low-enriched uranium to address concerns over nuclear proliferation.The attack comes amid surging tensions over Iran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme. Just a day earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Board of Governors formally censured Iran for failing to cooperate with inspectors, marking the first such rebuke in two decades.In response, Iran swiftly announced plans to build a third nuclear enrichment site and to upgrade its centrifuges with more advanced models.Israel has long vowed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon -- something Tehran denies it is pursuing, though Iranian officials have occasionally hinted at the possibility. Meanwhile, the United States had been bracing for potential escalation, having already withdrawn some diplomats from Baghdad and offering voluntary evacuation for the families of US military personnel stationed across the Middle East.After the attack, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the strikes by Israel were ""unilateral"" and that US' priority is now to protect the American forces in the region. Rubio said that Israel said that the strikes were done in the spirit of self-defence. He said that Iran must not harm US interests or personnel.Meanwhile, the global oil markets reacted quickly, with benchmark Brent crude prices jumping more than 2 per cent following the attack","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel struck Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. Netanyahu said the Israeli forces also attacked Tehran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb and ballistic missile programme.

Despite his typically hardline stance on immigration, US President Donald Trump on Thursday signalled a potential shift—suggesting some undocumented immigrants may be allowed to remain in the US to prevent labour shortages in critical sectors like agriculture and hospitality.Speaking at a White House event, Trump said an executive order is being considered to allow certain undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, especially those working for American farmers.""Our farmers are being hurt badly. They have very good workers,"" Trump said.""They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be great. We're going to have to do something about that,"" he added.Trump indicated the possible executive action would also impact the hotel sector: ""We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have.""""We're going to have an order on that pretty soon. We can't do that to our farmers,"" US President said.He did not specify what the order would contain or when it might be issued.Farm industry leaders have long urged the administration to shield agriculture from mass deportations, warning that such policies could severely disrupt the nation’s food supply chain, which relies heavily on immigrant labour.According to the US Departments of Labour and Agriculture, nearly half of America’s estimated 2 million farm workers—and many in the dairy and meatpacking industries—lack legal status.""Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform. ""Changes are coming!""The US president’s remarks come amid nationwide protests against immigration raids.Demonstrators have criticised the targeting of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, especially those detained at their workplaces. Protests intensified last week following enforcement actions in Los Angeles.On Thursday, Trump acknowledged the broader economic consequences of strict immigration enforcement, including within the hotel industry—an area connected to his own business interests.","US President Donald Trump suggests some undocumented immigrants may be allowed to remain in the US.

The Trump administration has begun notifying hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela that their temporary permission to live and work in the United States has been revoked, and they must leave the country immediately, according to a statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday.The notices are being sent via email to individuals who entered the country under a humanitarian parole program initiated by the Biden administration in October 2022. Approximately 532,000 people from the four nations had been granted two-year permits under the program, which allowed them to live and work in the US with financial sponsorship.DHS confirmed that the letters state their work authorization and legal status are now “effective immediately” terminated. The agency encouraged those affected to leave voluntarily through a mobile application called CBP Home, promising a travel stipend and a $1,000 payment upon return to their home country. However, the department offered no details on how it would track departures or distribute payments.The decision follows the US Supreme Court’s ruling last month that allowed the Trump administration to dismantle the program, which the former president had vowed to eliminate, calling it an example of “broad abuse” of the humanitarian parole system.“This is a deeply destabilizing decision,” said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refugee. “These are people that played by the rules... they passed security screenings, paid for their own travel, obtained work authorization, and began rebuilding their lives.”Zamora, a 34-year-old Cuban mother who came to the US in 2023 under the program, said she’s afraid of being detained while her child is at school. “I’m afraid to return to Cuba, the situation is very difficult there,” she said. Zamora is seeking permanent residency through the Cuban Adjustment Act but has not yet received approval. “I’m going to wait quietly without getting into trouble,” she added.","Hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela must leave the country immediately.

California Democratic Senator Dragged Out Of Kristi Noem Presser Over LA ICE Clashes | Watch





In a chaotic scene on Thursday, Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed, pushed to the ground and handcuffed during Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ’s news conference in Los Angeles.The incident was captured on video and has sparked national outrage and renewed criticism of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The California representative interrupted Noem’s event to raise questions about recent immigration raids that have triggered protests across the state and the country. Tensions flared after Noem said that federal forces were not retreating but instead planned to intensify operations to ""liberate"" the city from its ""socialist"" leadership.“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla shouted as a Secret Service agent grabbed him by the jacket and shoved him out of the room. A scuffle ensued in the hallway, where he was seen on his knees before being pushed to the floor and restrained by several officers.“Hands off!” he yelled during the altercation.The Department of Homeland Security later defended the actions of officers, claiming Padilla “chose disrespectful political theatre” and did not identify himself.However, the video clearly shows him stating his name and position. DHS also said that Padilla “was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply,” adding that officers “acted appropriately.”Padilla explained he was seeking answers about “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions” after receiving no response to prior inquiries. “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question… I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day labourers,” he said.Such treatment of a sitting senator drew immediate condemnation from fellow Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “despicable” and said, “We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.” Kamala Harris described the event as “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”Meanwhile, Noem later told Fox LA she had a “great” conversation with Padilla but criticised his behaviour as inappropriate. The White House accused the senator of “grandstanding.”Republicans defended Noem, with House Speaker Mike Johnson accusing Padilla of “charging” at her and suggesting the act was worthy of censure. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are now demanding an investigation into the incident.","California Democratic Senator Dragged Out Of Kristi Noem Presser Over LA ICE Clashes.

US President Donald Trump took a reflective turn on Thursday, steering a conversation back in time to the days of World War II.In remarks that blended history with surprise, Trump recounted recent conversations with French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin—both of which circled back to one of history’s greatest conflicts.""Macron is a good man,"" Trump began, before describing how the French leader told him, “We are celebrating World War II and our victory.” Trump said he responded with a smirk: ""Your victory?""—a remark that seemed to play down France’s role in the Allied win, despite being one of the key members of the coalition.He then shifted to Russia. Recalling a conversation with Putin, Trump said the Russian president emphasised the Soviet Union’s immense sacrifice in the war.""Russia fought with us in WWII and everybody hates them,"" Trump quoted Putin as saying, mentioning that the USSR lost around 51 million people during the conflict. ""And Germany and Japan, they're fine — someday somebody will explain that,"" Trump continued. ""But I like Germany and Japan too. Everybody hates Russia and they love Germany and Japan… It’s a strange world.""Trump went on to express confusion and disappointment over what he sees as America’s lack of commemoration for its role in the war. ""We won World War II and World War I, right? We won them. And yet, we are the only country that doesn’t celebrate. Everybody’s celebrating and we should celebrate too,"" he said.During World War II, the United States was a major force within the Allied powers, which included the UK, the Soviet Union (successor - modern day Russia), and France.

Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should the media play a role in raising awareness about such crimes? Yes, it's crucial No, it could lead to panic

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

Appeals court temporarily blocks judge's ruling to return control of National Guard to California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/appeals-court-temporarily-blocks-judges-ruling-to-return-control-of-national-guard-to-california/articleshow/121817354.cms,"Appeals court temporarily blocks judge's ruling to return control of National Guard to California(AP Photos)





The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.The court said it would hold a hearing on the matter on June 17. The ruling came only hours after a federal judge's order was to take effect at noon Friday.Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. The order applied only to the National Guard troops and not Marines who were also deployed to the LA protests. The judge said he would not rule on the Marines because they were not out on the streets yet.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had asked the judge for an emergency stop to troops helping carry out immigration raids, had praised the earlier ruling.""Today was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,"" Newsom said in a news conference before the appeals court decision.The White House had called Breyer's order ""unprecedented"" and said it ""puts our brave federal officials in danger.""""The district court has no authority to usurp the President's authority as Commander in Chief,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. ""The President exercised his lawful authority to mobilize the National Guard to protect federal buildings and personnel in Gavin Newsom's lawless Los Angeles. The Trump Administration will immediately appeal this abuse of power and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue. ""Newsom's case was solely focused on the National Guard, and the judge said when the state attorney asked about whether this could apply to the Marines that he would not rule on that because they were not on the streets yet.Marines in civil disturbance training at nearby base About 700 Marines have been undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California. Nicholas Green, an attorney for the state, told the court: ""I have been told by the office of the governor that within the next 24 hours, 140 Marines will replace and relieve National Guard members in Los Angeles.""Typically the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.Title 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service under certain limited circumstances, such as when the country ""is invaded,"" when ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,"" or when the president is unable ""to execute the laws of the United States.""Breyer said in his ruling that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.""The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of 'rebellion,'"" he wrote.It was not immediately clear how that would change the situation on the ground.California sued the federal government Newsom sued to block the Guard's deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids.The governor argued that the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and wanted the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying that involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles, said that as of Wednesday about 500 of the Guard troops had been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials.None of the Marines have been trained to go on immigration raids, and it is not yet clear if they eventually will, Sherman said.Trump improperly called up the Guard, judge says In his broad ruling, the judge determined Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place.The lawsuit argued that Title 10 also requires that the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard.Brett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not.In a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump's orders were not subject to judicial review.""Courts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation. Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. And courts should not interfere here either,"" the department said.""Our position is this is not subject to judicial review,"" Shumate told the judge.Breyer, who at one point waved a copy of the constitution, said he disagreed.""We're talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority. That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George,"" he said.Protests intensified The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.","The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hold a hearing on the matter on June 17.

Operation Rising Lion: Iran's key uranium enrichment facility hit 'several times',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-iran-amid-nuclear-tensions-operation-is-called-rising-lion-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/121814943.cms,"Here's what we know so far:



Israeli PM Netanyahu said in a video message: ""Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.""

Israel’s defence minister described the assault as a series of ""preemptive strikes."" Codenamed as 'Rising Lion'.

Israel’s military chief of staff said the country is fully prepared along all its borders and issued a strong warning to its enemies. ""We are prepared across all borders. I warn that anyone who will try to challenge us will pay a heavy price,"" he said.

According to a statement from IDF spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin, the Israeli military targeted Iranian military and nuclear sites in what is being described as a broad and coordinated offensive.

""This operation will continue as long as necessary, until we complete the mission,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that the strikes are aimed at Iran's nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and broader military infrastructure.

In response to the attacks, Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported that flights were suspended at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport . While the airport itself has not been directly hit, air traffic has been halted as a precaution.

State TV reported that the Natanz enrichment facility ""has been hit several times,"" and broadcast footage showing thick smoke rising from the site.

Israel has for years warned it would take direct military action if Iran’s nuclear program crossed red lines.

International watchdogs say Iran continues to enrich uranium close to weapons-grade levels, raising alarm in Israel and among its allies.

The strikes come as the Trump administration has been engaged in diplomatic efforts to reach a new agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear activities. US envoy Steve Witkoff has held five rounds of talks with Iranian officials in recent months. However, there are no signs that the US participated in the Israeli operation.





Israel launched a military operation against Iran late Thursday, with explosions reported across Tehran, the Iranian capital.

Trump's 'CHANGE OF HEART' After Elon Regrets Attacks On U.S. Pres. | Biggest Drama Of 2025 Ends?





An Islamist terror group leader has released a disturbing video calling for the assassination of US President Donald Trump , Vice President JD Vance, and several top advisers. He said their strong support for Israel was the reason behind the threat, according to the New York Post.The Yemen-based figure is Sa'ad bin Atef al-Awlaki, who is the leader of al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).In a disturbing 34‑minute video titled 'Inciting the Believers', released on Sunday, the terror leader urged American Muslims to “take revenge” and strike at those he called “infidel Americans”. He named Trump, Vance, as well as figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio , Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and billionaire Elon Musk . “Go after them and their families and all those who have any ties or are close to the politicians of the White House,” al‑Awlaki said.He further said, “There are no red lines after what has been happening to our people in Gaza,” and endorsed recent antisemitic attacks and prior assassination attempts on Trump, according to security sources.The video also includes a broader incitement of violence against Jewish people in the US. “Do not leave a single safe place for Jews — just as they have not left any homes, shelters, or respite for the Palestinians,” al‑Awlaki said.“Even hospitals are being bombed … Take revenge.”Al‑Awlaki became head of AQAP in March 2024 and has a $6 million US bounty on his head offered by the State Department. AQAP is officially designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US government. The Associated Press reported that al‑Awlaki’s video was his first since assuming leadership and also urged lone‑wolf attacks targeting leaders in Egypt, Jordan and Gulf states over the Gaza conflict.According to analysts, AQAP appears to be trying to regain prominence amid growing tensions in Gaza and rising influence of the Iran‑backed Houthi movement in Yemen.","The Yemen-based figure is Sa'ad bin Atef al-Awlaki, who is the leader of al- Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) In a disturbing 34‑minute video titled 'Inciting the Believers', released on Sunday, the terror leader urged American Muslims to “take revenge” and strike at those he called “infidel Americans’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121770314,width-400,resizemode-4/121770314.jpg"

Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli cabinet ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, accusing them of inciting extremist violence and enabling human rights abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.The coordinated move by five Western nations traditionally supportive of Israel marked a strong condemnation of Israel’s settlement expansion and a rare diplomatic rebuke of top Israeli officials. The sanctions, which include travel bans and asset freezes, come amid heightened violence in the West Bank following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the subsequent Gaza war.In a joint statement, the countries' foreign ministers said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich ""have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.”UK foreign secretary David Lammy said the two ministers had been “inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months"" and “encouraging egregious abuses of human rights.”Both men are key figures in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, responded defiantly, writing on social media: “We overcame Pharaoh, we’ll overcome Starmer’s Wall,” referring to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Smotrich, the finance minister, learned of the sanctions while inaugurating a new West Bank settlement and said, “We are determined to continue building. ”Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar labelled the sanctions “outrageous” and said he would consult with Netanyahu to coordinate a response.The move reflects increasing global frustration with Israel’s conduct in the occupied territories. Netanyahu himself is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes in Gaza — allegations he has denied, accusing the court of bias.The Biden administration had earlier imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, a policy that was reversed during Donald Trump’s presidency.Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack, who has long campaigned for action against Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, called the sanctions “historic,” saying they “break the wall of immunity Israeli politicians have enjoyed.” He added, “It is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.”Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 war. Today, over 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank in communities deemed illegal by most of the international community, while around 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military control.

Arabs EXPOSE Netanyahu's True Aim Behind Hostage Talks Lie | 'Only Interested In Power'

Future plan to end decades-old middle east conflict:







Ehud Olmert, former prime minister of Israel, has blamed the current PM, Benjamin Netanyahu , for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which triggered a deadly war in the middle east.In an interview with AFP, Olmert said that US President Donald Trump must intervene in the current situation and tell Netanyahu, “enough is enough.” He asserted that the United States has more influence on the Israeli government “than all the other powers put together,” and that Trump could “make a difference.”“This is it. I hope he (Trump) will do it. There is nothing that cannot happen with Trump. I don't know if this will happen. We have to hope, and we have to encourage him,” the former prime minister added.The US has remained a key ally of Israel. It has approved billions of dollars for selling weapons and military equipment to Israel, often using its veto power in the UN to shield Israel from international pressure.Olmert served as prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009.He also suggested that Israel should denounce the continuation of the war in Gaza as a ""crime"" and insisted that a two-state solution is the only way to end the conflict.He added that while the international community initially accepted Israel's argument of responding to the October 7 attacks as an act of self-defense, this perception shifted when Netanyahu, instead of ending the war in March, chose to intensify military actions in Gaza.Netanyahu ""has his personal interests, which are prioritized over what may be the national interests,"" Olmert charged.""If there is a war that is not going to save hostages, that cannot really do more than what has already been done against Hamas—and if, as a result, soldiers are getting killed, hostages may be killed, and innocent Palestinians are being killed—then, to my mind, this is a crime,"" Olmert said.""And this is something that should be condemned and not accepted,"" he added.The Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The Palestinian militants abducted 251 hostages, 54 of whom remain in Gaza, including 32 the Israeli military says are dead.Olmert, along with former Palestinian foreign minister Nasser Al-Qidwa, is planning to end decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians by creating a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.According to the plan, both sides would swap 4.4 per cent of land. Israel would retain some parts of the West Bank where Israeli settlers already live. In exchange, the Palestinians would receive territory for a future Palestinian state that is currently part of Israel.Ahead of a meeting this month in New York, co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia on steps toward recognizing a Palestinian state, Olmert said the plan is “practical, doable, relevant, valid, and real.”Al-Qidwa, who will present the plan with Olmert at a conference in Paris on Tuesday organized by the Jean-Jaurès Foundation think tank, told AFP that the proposal is “the only realistic and workable solution.”However, he said people in both Israel and the Palestinian territories still need to be convinced—especially while the war continues.“The moment the war comes to an end, we will see a different kind of thinking. We have to move forward with the acceptance of coexistence between the two sides,” he said.He also noted that serious progress is not possible under the current Israeli government or the Palestinian leadership, led by President Mahmud Abbas, who has been in power for 20 years.“You have to get rid of both. And that is going to happen,” he added, calling the Palestinian leadership “corrupt and ineffective.”","Ehud Olmert, former prime minister of Israel, has blamed the current PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas.

As children chased pigeons and old men murmured under poplar trees in Yerevan's central square, unease hung in the air.Armenia is divided over what more it must surrender for a shot at lasting peace with Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan has demanded sweeping concessions from its arch foe as part of a deal to end decades of hostility and conflict between the Caucasus rivals.Despite the tranquil scenes of a warm spring day, the issue has stirred worry in a fragile Armenian society, still reeling from a humiliating military defeat in 2023.Life ""is full of uncertainty"", said Nare Barseghyan, a 25-year-old philologist.""We have a divided society, toxic politics and a growing disrespect for our country,"" she added.""People shouldn't be constantly threatened that there will be a new war if we don't yield to Azerbaijani demands,"" she said.- Exodus -Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian neighbours have fought several wars for control of the Karabakh region, which was historically part of Armenia.Officially recognised as part of Azerbaijan, it was ruled by pro-Armenian separatists for three decades.Azerbaijan recaptured it in a lighting 24-hour offensive in 2023, prompting more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee the mountainous enclave.The defeat and exodus have deepened Armenia's political divisions and sparked street protests over the government's handling of the crisis.Seeking to move beyond the conflict, Baku and Yerevan agreed in March on the text of a broader peace treaty, hailed by some as a possible turning point in relations.But Azerbaijan is asking, among other demands, for Armenia to first amend its constitution to formally drop any territorial claims to Karabakh -- a move that would sever its bond with a region perceived by Armenians as their ancestral homeland.Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has signalled his readiness to comply for the sake of a lasting peace, announcing plans for a constitutional referendum in 2027.- 'No security' -The loss of Karabkah has splintered Armenian society.""Some believe the issue of Artsakh is closed but most do not -- because no nation can so easily give up a part of its homeland,"" said Robert Matevosyan, 52, using the Armenian name for Karabakh.""You can't close that chapter when every day you see people from Artsakh who've lost everything,"" he added, referring to the Karabakh refugees who rushed to the relative safety of Armenia.Matevosyan, a softly spoken engineer and part-time tour guide, is from Syunik, a southern Armenian region that borders Azerbaijan.When he returns to his village of Kapan, with Azerbaijani military posts just a few hundred metres away, he said he feels the tension in the air.""There is no security. Only the illusion of it,"" he told AFP.He does not want Armenia to change its constitution ""under threat from Azerbaijan"".""If anyone thinks this will bring peace, they're wrong. Azerbaijan doesn't want peace,"" he said.Such doubts are widespread across Armenian society, where Pashinyan's proposed constitutional referendum dominates public discourse.""The constitution shouldn't be changed under external pressure,"" said Karine Hambardzumyan, a 65-year-old physicist.""I don't want to build my life under someone else's threats.

UK Threatens To Sue Abramovich Over £2.5 BN Chelsea Sale As Russia-UK Tensions Escalate





LONDON: Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry into Britain’s role in 1984’s Operation Blue Star is announced in Parliament by the end of July.No-platforming is a political strategy where people actively work to prevent certain politicians or public figures from speaking publicly, often due to disagreements with their views.The warning, delivered in a letter signed by 455 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, follows a rally of more than 10,000 Sikhs at Trafalgar Square Sunday marking the 41st anniversary of the military operation at Amritsar’s Golden Temple against Sikh militants hiding there.Deputy PM Angela Rayner had publicly committed to the inquiry just before the 2024 general elections. Labour also promised it in two consecutive manifestos.The federation insists the inquiry must investigate both UK involvement in the Indian military operation and anti-Sikh actions in Britain during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. It plans to contact every MP individually, asking them to confirm written support for a judge-led inquiry by July-end.The letter warns Starmer that failing to act “could have massive consequences for the re-election of many Labour MPs”, citing rising support for Reform UK and independent candidates. Sikh Federation UK also said it is in talks with Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and SNP to secure broader political backing.Documents declassified in Jan 2014 showed Thatcher’s government sent an SAS officer to India in Feb 1984 after Indian officials requested help planning an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.In Feb 2014, then-cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood concluded there was “no record of any assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the limited military advice provided in mid-February,” describing it as a “one-off”.Sikh Federation disputes this, citing its 2017 Sacrificing Sikhs report. “The papers released prove training and equipment was secretly provided by Britain before the Indian army assault in June 1984,” the letter says. “In addition, counter-insurgency training and equipment were provided to Indian army and police to deal with the Sikh uprising that followed the massacre. We are confident a judge-led public inquiry will prove the UK involvement had a massive rather than limited impact. ”",Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced in Parliament.

The United Kingdom's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia, meanwhile, China poses a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”. The government's strategic review is set to be concluded on Monday, the Guardian reported.A 130-page document authored by three advisers to UK PM Keir Starmer also suggested on drawing extensively on lessons from the war in Ukraine. While Russia was the central concern, the document also highlighted China, that has at times cooperated with Moscow. It further identified Iran and North Korea as smaller but significant “regional disruptors.”According to the report, Britain was entering “a new era of threat,” as drones, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies were transforming the nature of warfare more profoundly than ever before.The analysis is not expected to announce new defence spending commitments but will reaffirm Starmer’s February pledge to raise the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% in the following parliament. However, the document is likely to support a major medium-term spending increase—potentially exceeding £50 billion in real terms—that may be agreed at the upcoming Nato summit in June.There, Western allies are considering a proposal to raise core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% dedicated to cyber and infrastructure efforts, partly in response to mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump.It is also expected to address the issue of British army size, as tensions continue between the ministry of defence and the treasury over whether to commit to increasing troop numbers beyond the current target of 73,000. This comes amid fresh figures revealing that the army's strength has fallen to 70,860 full-time trained soldiers as of 1 April—its lowest level since the Napoleonic era—marking a 2.3% decline over the past year.Meanwhile, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has also warned Indo-Pacific allies of an ""imminent threat"" from China, reassuring them that they would not face growing military and economic pressure from the country alone.","Britain's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia.

Prince William may be on holiday with Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, but his work as the Duke of Cornwall never truly takes a back seat.During a recent visit to the Duchy of Cornwall estate, The Telegraph witnessed how William remains focused on improving life for its residentseven while away with his family.One of the family’s favourite spots is Tresco, an island in the Isles of Scilly, part of the duchy. Here, the prince is well known for chatting with locals about community needs and development. His efforts have led to tangible improvements, including a new healthcare centre with a maternity suite, housing plans for essential workers like teachers and doctors, and initiatives promoting sustainable tourism.The Isles of Scilly hold a special place for William, as family holidays there echo his own childhood trips with Princess Diana and the future King Charles, People reported.A holidaymaker who spotted the couple in 2020 told the Daily Mirror, “William and Kate were riding their bicycles, having a laugh. They looked so happy enjoying the weather. I did do a double-take. They were really friendly and said hello.”In May this year, Prince William returned to the Isles of Scilly on official duty — much to the chagrin of his family.“My family are very upset I’m here without them,” he told the Daily Mail. “The children will kill me if I don’t go home later.” He was spotted buying pastries at a local cafe, likely to bring back for them.The Duchy of Cornwall, established by King Edward III in 1337, covers around 130,000 acres of land and assets, supporting the heir to the throne and his family financially. But William’s focus goes beyond finance, he is committed to bettering the lives of those living on duchy land, prioritising sustainability, mental health, and charitable partnerships.“II’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.","Prince William is on holiday with his family in the Isles of Scilly, part of the Duchy of Cornwall.
