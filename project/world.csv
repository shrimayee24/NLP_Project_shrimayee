"12 die, 40 vehicles gutted as tanker crash triggers blasts on Jaipur-Ajmer highway",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-die-40-vehicles-gutted-as-tanker-crash-triggers-blasts-on-jaipur-ajmer-highway/articleshow/116517121.cms,"‘Tanker gas gushed out like water from overflowing dam’



JAIPUR: An 800-metre stretch of the Jaipur-Ajmer National Highway near Bhankrota in the Rajasthan capital turned into a scene of unmitigated tragedy and devastation at dawn Friday after a collision between an LPG tanker and a truck set off a chain of explosions, killing 12 people, critically injuring at least 33, and leaving a row of cars and sleeper buses charred.Ten bus passengers are among the people unaccounted for. DCP (West) Amit Kumar said former IAS officer Karni Singh had also been reported missing.Authorities quoted witnesses as saying that the Bharat Petroleum tanker entering Jaipur from Ajmer was making a U-turn near the Delhi Public School junction when the linen-laden truck speeding down the opposite carriageway crashed into it. Such was the impact that it broke the tanker's nozzles, releasing a gush of LPG into the air that fuelled the serial explosions that followed.Vehicles trailing the tanker and the truck were reduced to metal barebones in the inferno. Some of the victims inside these vehicles, including buses, presumably had little or no time to escape.Over 40 vehicles were gutted in the fire trail. Officials said it could have been worse had the blaze spread to three fuel stations in the vicinity.CCTV footage from the scene captured the scale of explosions at 5.45am, with the flames visible from a distance and the noise waking up people several kilometres away. Seven of the deceased were identified as Harlal (32); motorcyclist Radheyshyam Choudhary (32); truck driver Shahbuddin (34) of UP's Rae Bareli; Shahid (34) and Faizan (20) from Udaipur' Mahendra (27) of Makrana; and Anita Meena (28), an armed police constable.The tanker driver was unaccounted for until evening. Unconfirmed reports said he tried to flee but was unlikely to have made it through the inferno. The seven injured who are on ventilator support at Jaipur's SMS Hospital include Yusuf (45), a Banswara resident; Vijeta (23); Raju Ram Baberwal (40) of Sikar; and Govind (32) from Kekri.A witness said gas “gushed out of the nozzles like water from an overflowing dam”. A sleeper bus from Udaipur ferrying 24 passengers went up in flames. A truck filled with cartons of matchboxes caught fire just outside a fuel pump. Another tanker filled with gas broke down. Fire tenders used foam and water to avert an explosion.Officials said over 25 fire engines were deployed, with teams arriving from Mansarovar, VKI, Vaishali Nagar, and Bani Park. The fire brigade removed the LPG tanker that exploded from the middle of the road. The residual gas was transferred to another tanker. In an official statement on X, Bharat Petroleum condoled the deaths and pledged Rs 6 lakh each to the next of kin of the victims and Rs 2 lakh to the injured.PM Modi announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh and Rs 50,000 for the injured. CM Bhajan Lal Sharma announced assistance of Rs 5 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 1 lakh each to the injured. Transport secretary Shuchi Tyagi directed Jaipur district magistrate to set up a six-member committee to investigate the accident.The Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety, too, wrote to Rajasthan govt, seeking a report on the accident. The committee asked for a plan to improve road safety, officials said.","A collision between an LPG tanker and a truck set off a chain of explosions, killing 12 people, critically injuring at least 33, and leaving a row of cars and sleeper buses charred.

What Donald Trump said on the possibility of a govt shutdown



What will happen if the govt shuts down?



Longest govt shutdown

As 38 Republicans voted against the stopgap deal that was championed by President-elect Donald Trump, VP-elect JD Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson replacing the 1,500-page bill that the Republican leadership disapproved of, a federal government shutdown is the most likely scenario now.Congress now has until Friday midnight to approve a spending bill or extend the deadline in order to avert a government shutdown. Elon Musk is being blamed for the scenario as he made non-stop posts on X rallying against the old bill. Dems called him 'President Musk' while some Republicans even wanted him as the Speaker.Musk did not step back and reacted to the possibility of a govt shutdown and said Dems deserve to lose bigtime in the midterms. But it was not only Dems, 38 Republicans too rejected it. ""If Dems reject this & government shuts down, they deserve to lose bigtime in the midterms,"" Musk said.Before the new bill was rejected, Donald Trump said: ""Our country is far better off closing up for a period of time than it is agreeing to the things that the Democrats want to force upon us.""Trump said Biden is still the president and it's his obligation to properly lead. ""Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling. Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President,"" Trump said.Federal funding expires on midnight December 20, today. Without a new bill, the federal government would not be able ti pay its employees which also included the military. Social security benefits, however, won't be affected during a shutdown as that comes under mandatory spending and is not funded through bills passed by Congress. Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy families and veterans' benefits would also continue.The longest shutdown was for 34 days from December 21, 2018 to January 25, 2019.","Federal funding expires on midnight December 20, today.

“Couldn’t Care Less”: Why Kylie Kelce Isn’t Bothered With Chart Numbers And People’s Opinions



Kylie Kelce is aware of what her naysayers have to say following her impressive milestone. The NFL WAG’s podcast “Not Gonna Lie” is only three episodes in but has already surpassed Joe Rogan's bestselling podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience” on the charts. Kelce and Rogan’s show is currently on first and second place on the charts on Spotify, but as of now, she still holds the top spot on Apple Podcasts. But the podcaster doesn’t seem too bothered with her new accomplishment.Kylie who’s married to former Eagles center Jason Kelce is a mum of three children, namely, Wyatt, Elliotte, and Bennett. The former high school coach is also expecting her fourth child with Jason and often talks about her home life on her podcast. The widespread interest in her podcast has come as a surprise to many but listeners have found Kylie’s show authentic and relatable. “I couldn’t care less about the charts,” she told the New York Times recently.She’s aware that her haters’ biggest criticism of her seems to be that no one knows who she is, “which is very funny to me,” she told the Times, “I don’t need you to know who I am.”“I’m focused on putting out content that people like to consume,” Kelce said. “If that puts us there for a week, cool. If it puts us there for longer than that, cool. But I also don’t need to feed any conflict that’s created by it.”There’s no denying the massive influence Rogan’s podcast has had on American listeners. Rogan has even hosted Donald Trump and JD Vance on his program in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. In fact, it’s common knowledge that Rogan’s podcast resonates the most with young male, right-leaning audience. However, Kelce shared in her interview that her political beliefs “aggressively lean” left.Kelce told The New York Times that she would be open to hosting any political figures on her show, and also named Michelle Obama and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as potential guests. She shared the latter's initiative to put free period products in school bathrooms as an admirable move.“I would talk to Michelle Obama in a heartbeat, and I know she is not personally running,” said Kelce, adding that she'd ""love it"" if the former First Lady would run for office.Also Read : Las Vegas Raiders Eyeing Sam Darnold As $10M Star Quarterback for 2025?","Kylie Kelce's podcast ""Not Gonna Lie"" is only three episodes in but has already surpassed Joe Rogan's bestselling podcast.

Delphi double murders: Indiana man sentenced to 130 years for 2017 murders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/delphi-double-murders-indiana-man-sentenced-to-130-years-for-2017-murders/articleshow/116512913.cms,"An Indiana man has been sentenced to 130 years in prison for the 2017 murders of two teenage girls who disappeared while hiking near Delphi. Richard Allen, was found guilty last month of killing 13-year-old Abigail Williams and 14-year-old Liberty German.During a brief hearing on Friday, 52 year old Allen was sentenced by Judge Fran Gull to the maximum 65 years for each of the two murder charges, to be served one after the other. The hearing, which lasted less than two hours, saw victim impact statements from six of the girls’ relatives. Following the sentence, Allen’s defence team revealed that they would appeal the verdict.“Thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims. What they went through was unimaginable,” defense attorney Jennifer Auger said. She further added, “but today is not the day for that.”Allen had faced between 45 years and 130 years in prison in the killings of the Delphi teens.The jury, consisting of seven women and five men, was kept in isolation throughout the trial, which started on October 18 in Delphi, the girls' hometown. Located about 60 miles (100 kilometres) northwest of Indianapolis, Delphi has a population of around 3,000 residents.Allen, a resident of Delphi, was arrested in October 2022, five years after the girls were killed. At the time, he was working as a pharmacy technician just a short distance from the courthouse. His trial had been delayed multiple times, and his defence lawyers were replaced and reinstated after a series of complications.Abby and Libby went missing on February 13, 2017, after being dropped off for a hike. Their bodies were found the next day, both with their throats cut. Prosecutors presented evidence, including a gun and a bullet, tying Allen to the crime.In his closing arguments, Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland told the jury that Allen, who possessed a gun, forced the girls off the hiking trail and initially intended to assault them.However, he changed his plans after a van drove by and instead slit their throats. McLeland also pointed out that an unspent bullet found between the teens’ bodies had been ""cycled through"" Allen’s .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun as per the news agency AP.A grainy video filmed by Libby before she died also showed a man following the girls, which prosecutors argued was Allen.They also played a recording of Allen admitting to his wife, “I did it. I killed Abby and Libby.”Despite these confessions, Allen’s defence team argued that they weren’t reliable, claiming he was under intense mental stress and isolation at the time. They also pointed out that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene. They also suggested that the murders might have been part of a ritualistic killing by a white nationalist group, however this theory was rejected by the judge, stating there was no credible evidence to support it.","Richard Allen, 52, was found guilty last month of killing Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.

The purpose behind the construction of Stonehenge, a monument dating back roughly 5,000 years, has long puzzled historians and archaeologists. However, a new study may have shed light on its origins, suggesting it served as a symbol of unity among the peoples of ancient Britain , according to the news outletResearchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University claim that Stonehenge was created to represent the unification of communities from different regions of Britain. They claim that people from Scotland and Wales contributed local stones to the construction as a gesture of goodwill.The study, published in, highlights Stonehenge as an early example of a political and symbolic effort to unify diverse communities. The researchers describe the monument as a ""monumental expression of unity between people, land, ancestors, and the heavens.""In the paper, the researchers argue that Stonehenge’s long-distance links support the theory that the Neolithic monument had a unifying purpose in ancient Britain, alongside its symbolic value.""The fact that all of its stones originated from distant regions, making it unique among over 900 stone circles in Britain, suggests that the stone circle may have had a political as well as a religious purpose,"" said lead author Professor Mike Parker Pearson from UCL's Institute of Archaeology.""[It was] a monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos.""The study posits that the Scottish and Welsh contributions symbolized alliances and shared efforts, embodying a sacred or political unity . Additionally, similarities in architectural styles between northern Scotland and the Stonehenge region suggest strong connections between these areas.""[This was] perhaps to cement an alliance or to take part in the extraordinary long-distance collaboration that building Stonehenge represented and embodied,"" the authors added.Evidence shows that many of the individuals buried at Stonehenge lived outside Salisbury Plain, indicating it was a site that drew people from across Britain.The study aligns with earlier research suggesting Stonehenge was used for rituals and ceremonies tied to the solstices. During the winter solstice, the setting sun aligns with the Altar Stone, further emphasizing its celestial significance.Theories about Stonehenge's purpose have ranged from its use as a solar calendar to a center for healing, ancestor worship, or burial rites.

CHANDIGARH: Over a year and half ago, among the gathering to mourn the demise of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch Parkash Singh Badal at the party’s head office in Chandigarh was a teary eyed Om Prakash Chautala who despite not in the pink of his health had come to have a last glimpse of his old family friend. One of the chapters of long family ties between two stalwart political families of the region – Badals in Punjab and Chautalas in Haryana – came to an end on Friday with the passing away of fivetime Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala.Their native villages might be nearly 45 km apart but the closeness of Chautala family with that of late Badal’s is imprinted on the entire stretch between Badal and Chautala villages. These families have maintained a bond that goes back nearly seven decades.The proximity could be gauged from the fact that in April 1984, when senior Badal was in jail, it was Devi Lal who had performed the “kanyadaan” during the wedding of Akali leader’s only daughter Parneet Kaur with Adaish Partap Singh Kairon, son of former Punjab CM Partap Singh Kairon.According to senior Akali Dal leader Sikander Singh Maluka, “Their friendship dates back to much earlier than that. They came close to each other while fighting for the farmers’ issues in farm agitations. They came even closer when Bansi Lal was the CM and there was a bypoll in Rori in 1974. At that time, it was Badal sahib who made Devi Lal contest the byelection. Devi Lal had given up saying that Bansi Lal will not let him win. But Badal sahib insisted. And when Devi Lal said he did not have money, Badal sahib gave him his chequebook. Devi Lal contested and won and the ties between the two families got strengthened. After Devi Lal, Badal sahib’s ties with Chautala continued.”Daljit Singh Cheema, another senior Akali Dal leader, said, “Chautala sahib and other members of the family maintained the ties. After Badal sahib’s demise, Chautala family members put his statue in Killianwali. These things teach a lot that relationships are not confined to politics alone. When Badal sahib was in jail, Chaudhary Devi Lal performed all rituals of Badal sahib’s daughter’s wedding.”Cheema added, “Despite differences among the Chautala family members, all members came to attend the funeral and bhog ceremony of Badal sahib.”On the 97th birth anniversary of senior Badal in Dec last year, a lifesize statue of Badal was installed by Chautala family alongside Devi Lal’s statue at a memorial in Killianwali village in Muktsar district near Punjab-Haryana border. Sukhbir Singh Badal had expressed his gratitude to Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) president Ajay Chautala and his son and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala for making the “space complete” while praying for a stronger bond between the two families. After the demise of Devi Lal in 2001, Badal had dedicated the memorial to former deputy prime minister by installing his life size statue in Killianwali.Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo O P Chautala was seven years younger to Badal and the members of both families treated the latter as family elder till he passed away in April last year.Prior to that both families treated Devi Lal, who was 13 years elder to Badal, as the family elder till his demise in 2001.The Chautalas and Badals have been extending support to each other during their respective electoral battles in both the states over the years. The scale of the decades-old family bonding has been such that no political alliance could ever threaten to cause any difference between them.The perennial Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal dispute between Punjab and Haryana where both Badals and Chautalas took respective stands for their states had no impact on their ties as the two families remained closely knit.In a post on X, Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “Deeply saddened by the passing away of veteran leader and former Haryana CM Shri Om Parkash Chautala ji. All his life, he championed the cause of farmers and the poor. His passing away at a time when our farmers are engaged in a fight for justice and survival is a huge loss to society in general and to farmers and downtrodden people in particular. His passing away is also a huge personal loss to me and my family. I will always miss his warm and guiding hand. I share the deep sense of loss that common people and his family must be passing through at this hour.”",Om Prakash Chautala was among the gathering to mourn the demise of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch Parkash Singh Badal. The two families have maintained a bond that goes back nearly seven decades.

Republican division grows as 34 House members vote against shutdown bill. Who were they?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republican-division-grows-as-34-house-members-vote-against-shutdown-bill-who-were-they/articleshow/116522725.cms,"The Capitol is pictured in Washington (AP)

A last-minute vote on Friday in the US House of Representatives saw over 30 Republicans voting against a critical spending bill designed to avert a partial government shutdown , signaling a deepening divide within the party on fiscal policy .The bill, designed to extend government funding until March 14, passed with 34 Republicans voting against it, while no Democrats opposed it. One Democrat, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), voted present. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it will face further scrutiny before potentially reaching President Biden ’s desk. The president has indicated he will sign the bill if it clears the Senate.Among the Republicans who voted against the measure were prominent figures such as Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.), and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who strongly objected to the $100 billion allocated for the Biden administration.Rep. Burchett criticized the bill, and was quoted by the Fox News Digital as saying, “I don’t know why we’re giving Joe Biden $100 billion to play with in 30 days. Oddly enough, it didn’t have what Trump wanted most of all.”This vote followed a chaotic week of negotiations, during which lawmakers scrambled to reach an agreement. A bipartisan 1,547-page spending proposal was released on Tuesday, but it fell apart after backlash from figures like Elon Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.A Trump-backed, more condensed version of the bill was introduced Thursday night but also failed to gain traction. Ultimately, the bill that passed Friday marked a return to a more traditional funding approach, although it still faced considerable pushback from conservative Republicans.Rep. Boebert, known for her fierce criticism of President Biden, explained her vote by saying, “I’m just ready for President Trump to be back.”Other Republicans who voted against the bill included Rep. Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.), Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas), Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.), Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah), Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho), Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas), Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.), Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.), Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.), Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.), Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas), Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.), Rep. Greg Lopez (R-Colo.), Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), and Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-Wis.).With the shutdown deadline looming, the House's action has cleared a path to avert a shutdown, but the Senate’s approval is still uncertain. Should the bill pass in the Senate, it will head to President Biden, who has signaled his intention to sign it and avoid a shutdown.","The bill, designed to extend government funding until March 14, passed with 34 Republicans voting against it, while no Democrats opposed it.

White House in crisis? Biden and Harris 'cancel Christmas trips and rush back' amid speculations of emergency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-in-crisis-biden-and-harris-cancel-christmas-trips-and-rush-back-amid-speculations-of-emergency/articleshow/116492629.cms,"Biden reportedly returned to Washington, DC. Similarly, Harris canceled her planned flight to California and stayed in the capital.

Social media abuzz with speculation

Budget crisis speculation

Earlier conversations with

Harris' recent public appearance

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris abruptly canceled their holiday plans on Friday, fueling speculation about an ongoing emergency at the White House , as per various reports. Neither has issued a public statement , leaving the nation guessing about the sudden changes.Biden, who was expected to spend Christmas in Delaware, reportedly returned to Washington, DC, taking his motorcade directly from the airport to the White House late in the evening. Similarly, Harris canceled her planned flight to California and stayed in the capital.Harris had planned to be in LA until Monday, but her office provided no reason for the last-minute cancellation, leaving many to wonder if the political turmoil over the government’s funding was the cause. As the deadline for a potential government shutdown looms on Friday, Harris' absence from the West Coast has fueled further uncertainty about the Biden administration’s strategy in handling the budget impasse.The abrupt schedule changes have sparked widespread speculation on social media. One user noted discrepancies in the president’s official schedule, saying, “The official schedule for Biden does say he was to return to the White House at 5:30 pm, but as you can see, it has recently been updated.”Another user posted, “Kamala Harris canceled her trip, rushing back to the White House…WHAT IS HAPPENING?” The lack of clarity has left many questioning whether the cancellations are tied toHurricane Helene briefings or another undisclosed matter.Meanwhile, some social media users circulated images of an alleged White House press release stating that the ""Vice President will not travel to Los Angeles, CA, and will remain in Washington, DC.""Republicans are embroiled in an internal battle over a budget deal brokered between Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democrats, aimed at averting a government shutdown. Critics have slammed the bill for being rushed through Congress, arguing that members were not given enough time to fully review the proposal.Meanwhile, the deal was further complicated when Republicans, led by President-elect Donald Trump and entrepreneur Elon Musk, introduced an alternate funding bill. That plan was swiftly rejected in the House, with many Republicans voting against it, creating a partisan standoff.Democrats, particularly those close to Harris, expressed frustration that the bipartisan agreement, which was seen as a potential compromise, was derailed after Musk publicly campaigned against it on X, the social media platform he owns. The showdown has added to the tension on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers race to find a resolution before the shutdown deadline.While Harris has not publicly commented on the situation, insiders close to her suggest that she is carefully weighing her political future, reported the Blaze. Following the aftermath of a challenging election, Harris has reportedly told allies that she intends to remain an influential figure in American politics.Some speculate that she may consider a campaign for governor of California, though others believe she will take on a more prominent role opposing the incoming Trump administration, reported the Blaze.“She is not someone who makes rash decisions,” said former Harris aide Brian Brokaw. “She takes, sometimes, a painfully long time to make decisions. So I would pretty much guarantee you she has no idea what her next move is.”With the deadline for a government shutdown fast approaching, all eyes will be on Harris and her next steps as the political drama continues to unfold in Washington.Before his return, Biden had a conversation with Pope Francis to discuss efforts to promote peace during the holiday season. According to a White House readout, the president thanked the pope for his advocacy on global issues and accepted an invitation to visit the Vatican next month.Harris’ last public event was on Tuesday, where she addressed high school and college students in Largo, Maryland. During her speech, she urged supporters to remain committed to their values despite the challenges ahead. “Yes, there is disappointment, but there is also resolve for the future. We must stay in the fight,” Harris said, referencing the aftermath of her election loss to Donald Trump.","Biden reportedly returned to Washington, DC, taking his motorcade directly from the airport to the White House late in the evening.

The driver of the car that plowed into a Christmas market crowd in Magdeburg , Germany, on Friday, killing at least two people, including a child, has been identified as Taleb. The city government reported at least 68 injuries, with 15 people in critical condition. The driver was arrested immediately.Taleb A., a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian medical doctor, is a consultant in psychiatry and psychotherapy, according to a report by The Guardian.

Nancy Mace escalates feud with Fox News host: 'Which bathroom do we think Trey Gowdy uses?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nancy-mace-escalates-feud-with-fox-news-host-which-bathroom-do-we-think-trey-gowdy-uses/articleshow/116523542.cms,"Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy

This week, a heated online exchange between Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy sent shockwaves through the political sphere, culminating in a series of personal jabs and escalating tensions within the GOP.It all began when Gowdy took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize Mace, saying, “Nancy Mace would not be in the House if it weren’t for Donald Trump, and she can’t vote the way that he asked her to today?” Mace wasted no time firing back, retorting, “I have a message for Trey Gowdy: You let Hillary Clinton off the hook for Benghazi. Sit your ass back down.”However, the spat didn’t end there. Mace further escalated the conflict by sharing an old photo of Gowdy from his congressional days, with the caption, “Which bathroom do we think Trey Gowdy uses?” The comment appeared to be a swipe not only at Gowdy but also at her opposition to transgender rights , a point of contention that has repeatedly surfaced in her politics.Mace’s comment seemed to echo her criticisms of incoming transgender Representative Sarah McBride , who made history as the first openly transgender state senator in the US McBride, a fierce advocate for transgender rights, has notably used Capitol Hill bathrooms that align with her gender identity, a topic that has sparked controversy among certain Republican lawmakers.The clash with Gowdy wasn’t the only fallout Mace faced this week. Wesley Donehue, a South Carolina-based political consultant, revealed that he had severed ties with Mace months ago, citing her behavior as the reason. “I fired Nancy Mace as a client because I’m a political consultant, not a babysitter or a sex therapist,” Donehue wrote. He went on to call Mace’s actions “egotistical” and described her remarks as a “childish attack.”Adding fuel to the fire, Mace’s former communications director, Natalie Johnson, posted an old video of Mace enthusiastically praising Gowdy on Fox News. At the time, Mace referred to herself as a “huge fangirl” of Gowdy. Johnson’s comment, “It’s tough being a sycophant,” suggested a deepening fracture within Mace’s political network.This personal drama comes at a particularly challenging moment for the GOP. The Republican Party is currently embroiled in internal strife as they struggle to agree on a government funding bill . Just recently, a Republican-backed spending plan, supported by Donald Trump and Elon Musk, was shot down in the House by a 174-235 vote. The bill, which sought to raise the debt ceiling through 2027, was opposed by every Democrat in the chamber and 38 House Republicans, further exposing the ongoing divisions within the GOP.","Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy got into a heated online exchange this week.

A terrifying incident unfolded in Magdeburg, Germany , on Friday as a black BMW barreled into a bustling Christmas market, killing at least two people, including a child, and injuring 68 others. The attack has been described by local authorities as a terror act, with 15 of the injured in critical condition.Eyewitnesses painted a grim picture of the chaos that ensued when the vehicle drove into the crowd at high speed, traveling 400 meters towards the town hall. One eyewitness, who spoke with German media, described the sound of screams and cries as people scrambled to escape the path of the oncoming car. A food stall operator likened the scene to a ""war zone,"" with blood on the ground and injured victims receiving medical treatment amid the destruction.As the events unfolded, several videos began circulating on social media, showing the moments before and after the car crashed into the crowd. In one particularly harrowing video, the alleged driver, later identified as 50-year-old Taleb A., is seen lying on the ground beside his wrecked vehicle. A police officer, standing just a few meters away, pointed a drawn weapon at the suspect, who remained on the pavement, his head propped up, while officers moved in to arrest him. Passersby can be seen watching in disbelief as the arrest is made.The footage, shared by the German news agency dpa, shows the intense and chaotic aftermath of the attack. Emergency responders were quickly on the scene, tending to victims who were wrapped in thermal blankets and surrounded by medical teams. “This was a real chaotic situation,” said MDR reporter Lars Frohmüller, who arrived shortly after the attack. “We saw blood on the floor, and we saw people sitting beside each other with golden and silver foils around them.”The suspect, Taleb A, is a Saudi Arabian national who has lived in Germany since 2006 and was granted refugee status in 2016.

A medical doctor and consultant in psychiatry and psychotherapy, Taleb’s motive remains unclear, though local officials have emphasized that he acted alone and there is no ongoing threat to the city.Saxony-Anhalt’s leader, Reiner Haseloff, addressed the public, assuring them that the situation was under control. ""As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,"" Haseloff stated.Witnesses at the scene described the terror and confusion as the vehicle sped through the crowded market.

A missile attack on Kyiv early Friday morning killed at least one person and injured 12 others, according to Ukrainian authorities. Several embassies also sustained damage in the attack, which Ukraine attributed to Russian forces.The Kyiv City Military Administration confirmed the casualties via Telegram, reporting that five of the injured were hospitalised while others received on-site treatment.The attack, which began around 7am, involved five ballistic missiles, all intercepted by Ukrainian air defences, according to Ukraine's air force command. 40 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were also destroyed, and 20 more drones failed to reach their targets.Despite the defence efforts, falling debris caused widespread damage and injuries in Kyiv's city center.Infrastructure across multiple districts were impacted due to the impact of debris, according to Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city military administration. ""In one district, an office building, road surface, and gas pipe were damaged, and five cars caught fire,"" Popko said in a Telegram post. Another district saw a building under construction catch fire due to falling debris.Among the damaged sites were embassies of several countries, including Albania, Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal, and Montenegro, according to Ukraine's foreign ministry. Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi condemned the attack as ""barbaric,"" mentioning that windows and doors of embassy premises were shattered.Portugal’s foreign ministry reported light damage to its facility and summoned Russia’s charge d’affaires to protest the incident.Russia’s defence ministry claimed responsibility for the strike, stating that it targeted Ukrainian military facilities in retaliation for a recent Ukrainian missile attack on a chemical plant in Russia's Rostov region.The ministry said the strike focused on a command post of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Kyiv Luch design bureau, and positions of the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system. ""The strike targets were achieved. All objects were hit,"" the ministry wrote on Telegram.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, calling for increased sanctions against Russia. He also expressed gratitude to international partners for their continued support in bolstering Ukraine's air defence systems.""I thank all of our partners who are responding to this and other Russian attacks by being ready to provide more air defence systems,"" Zelenskyy said, as reported by CNN.Meanwhile, Russian forces also targeted the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson with heavy shelling, killing two people and injuring 10, according to Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration.","At least one person killed and 12 injured in missile attack on Kyiv.

"Biden skipped key call on Afghanistan pullout, citing mental fatigue: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-skipped-key-call-on-afghanistan-pullout-citing-mental-fatigue-report/articleshow/116515756.cms,"Joe Biden

A recent report exposes White house cover ups of Joe Biden’s health related concerns. The report released by The Wall Street Journal revealed that President Joe Biden was so mentally fatigued that once he allegedly missed a critical phone call from the House Armed Services Committee before the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.Representative Adam Smith (D-Wash), who then chaired the powerful committee at the time, revealed he had tried to contact Biden to express concerns about the administration’s optimistic public comments on the withdrawal. Based on his extensive work on the issue, Smith believed the process would be far more difficult than White House officials were suggesting and sought to share his findings.“I was begging them to set expectations low,” Smith told the Journal. However, despite his efforts, he was unable to speak directly with the president, the New York Post quoted.The August 2021 withdrawal ended the United States' longest-running conflict but resulted in significant casualties, including 13 American service members and more than 170 Afghans, during the chaotic evacuation at Kabul airport.The operation also left $7 billion worth of US military equipment behind and allowed the Taliban to seize control of Afghanistan.In the aftermath, Smith publicly criticised the administration for lacking a “clear-eyed view” of the toppled US-backed Afghan government’s stability. His remarks to the Washington Post drew a heated response from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who reportedly called Smith to express his anger. According to the Wall Street Journal, Smith pushed back against Blinken, who later accepted responsibility for the disastrous withdrawal.Biden eventually apologised to Smith during a personal phone call—the only direct communication the congressman received from the president during his tenure as committee chair. Reflecting on his experience, Smith remarked, “The Biden White House was more insulated than most,” noting that he had spoken with President Barack Obama on multiple occasions during his presidency, even before becoming committee chair.The report also detailed how Biden’s aides managed his schedule to accommodate his fluctuating mental and physical stamina. They allegedly delayed meetings or rescheduled them for later in the day, acknowledging that the president had “good days and bad days.”This bombshell report also addressed concerns over Biden’s inaccessibility, even to members of his own party, during a pivotal moment in his presidency.A national security official even told an aide in spring 2021, “Today was a bad day, so we’re going to address this tomorrow.”Concerns over Biden’s energy levels first emerged during the 2020 presidential campaign, after his widely criticised debate performance against former President Donald Trump. At the time, staff admitted Biden had difficulty functioning outside a six-hour window that typically ended around 4 pm.The Afghanistan withdrawal remains a defining moment of Biden’s presidency, with its repercussions continuing to influence public opinion and policy discussions.",A report released by The Wall Street Journal revealed that President Joe Biden was so mentally fatigued that once he allegedly missed a critical phone call from the House Armed Services Committee.

38 House Republicans defied Donald Trump's command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/38-house-republicans-defied-donald-trumps-command/articleshow/116515076.cms,"President-elect Trump's hammerlock on the Republican Party was shaken on Thursday night when 38 of his party's lawmakers in the House voted to defy his command to support a spending and debt deal . Writing on social media, Trump had told Republicans to ""vote 'YES' for this Bill, TONIGHT!"" He said it was vital to pass a bill that extended spending until early next year and suspended the nation's debt limit until 2027, well into his next term. For the better part of a decade, that kind of dictate has usually been enough for Trump, who has methodically seized control of the Republican Party at all levels. But with just a month left before he returns to office, Trump found out that at least some of his followers were willing to buck his leadership in the right circumstances. The rebel Republicans, combined with most House Democrats, sank that legislation.The defiance came not from the handful of moderate Republicans who have previously earned the prez-elect's ire. This time, it was conservatives who would normally align themselves with Trump's philosophy who voted against his wishes. Several did so because they opposed the idea of raising debt limit for more than two years, something they argue would allow out-of-control govt spending to continue unabated. Trump had argued that raising the limit would clear the decks for his ambitious legislative agenda, removing a potential fight over the issue early in his term.For Trump, the actions of his party Thursday raise questions: Have the signs suggesting his grip over the GOP is tighter than ever been wrong? Has he lost some control he once had? Or was the vote merely a brief hiccup in the absolute loyalty forecast for when he moves back into the White House next month? The answer may not be known until Trump puts a razor-thin Republican majority to the test next year. It will take a handful of Republicans to doom any one of his agenda items in House or Senate. But such defiance would come at the risk of their political careers. Still, the rebel Republicans voted against his wishes Thursday despite an explicit electoral threat.","38 Republicans in the House voted against President-elect Trump's command to support a spending and debt deal.

Ex-CNN analyst admits ignoring Biden’s health decline as report exposes White house cover-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-cnn-analyst-admits-ignoring-bidens-health-decline-as-report-exposes-white-house-cover-up/articleshow/116514521.cms,"An apology about my Joe Biden coverage

Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza has admitted he should have “pushed harder” to cover concerns about President Joe Biden ’s mental and physical health.In a YouTube video released on Thursday, Cillizza confessed that, despite being regularly urged by Republicans to address Biden’s decline, he failed to do so, brushing off the issue at the time.“As a reporter, I have a confession to make,” Cillizza said. “I should have pushed harder earlier for more information about Joe Biden’s mental and physical well-being and any signs of decline.”He recalled that Republicans often contacted him during his time at CNN, questioning why he didn’t address the apparent signs of the president’s deterioration.However, Cillizza admitted that he “brushed them off” because he had not seen concrete evidence of Biden’s faltering health, despite visible verbal gaffes, physical stumbles, and moments when the president appeared to lose his train of thought in public.Cillizza’s confession follows a bombshell report by The Wall Street Journal, which reveals how Biden’s aides carefully took advantage of his presidency to conceal the extent of his age-related decline, as per the New York Post.According to the report, meetings with top national security officials were often rescheduled or cancelled, with staff responding that Biden “has good days and bad days,” and some days were simply “bad days.” Lawmakers also reported having limited contact with the president, who was largely surrounded by his fiercely loyal staff.Cillizza cited the report in his video, explaining that he accepted the White House’s position that Biden was mentally and physically fit, and which deterred him from pushing harder on the issue. He also admitted that the fear of “age-shaming” played a part in his hesitance to investigate further.“The White House and the people around Joe Biden were absolutely adamant that suggesting anything — asking the question about whether he was in some physical, mental or both decline, was offensive,” Cillizza said.“‘How could you? It’s age-shaming.’ And I think that impacted me at some level.”While Cillizza said he occasionally raised the question, he also admitted that he didn’t “push on it” as much as he should have.The political pundit also acknowledges that after leaving CNN, Biden’s age became more of an issue, and he started questioning the president’s ability.“Once it became a little bit more clear to me about Biden’s age, I think I did write pretty regularly and talk pretty regularly about how I wasn’t sure that this guy was up to it,” he said.“And then obviously, after the June 27 debate, everybody, including me, was writing and talking about it.”The debate, which raised questions about Biden’s ability, led Democratic figures, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to encourage him to step aside and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, who later lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.Reflecting further, Cillizza acknowledged, “I probably should’ve pushed harder on the Biden age stuff because, in retrospect, it’s clear that the people close to him knew that at best, he had some good days and some bad days.”He further added that the poor performance at the June 27 debate made it evident that Biden’s health was a concern, raising questions about when his close aides were aware of the extent of his decline.“When did people near him know, what did they know, and why did they not share?” Cillizza questioned.","Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza has admitted he should have ‘pushed harder’ to cover concerns about President Joe Biden’s mental and physical health.

Pakistan developing missiles that could eventually hit US: Official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-developing-missiles-that-could-eventually-hit-us-official/articleshow/116486852.cms,"White House flags Pakistan's missile advances

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

Pakistan slams US missile sanctions as ‘biased’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-us-missile-sanctions-as-biased/articleshow/116480917.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme.

The move freezes any US-based assets belonging to the targeted entities and also forbids American citizens or businesses from engaging with them.“In light of the continuing proliferation threat of Pakistan’s long-range missile development, the United States is designating four entities for sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,” a press release by the US Department of State said.The NDC, headquartered in Islamabad, plays a central role in Pakistan’s missile development efforts, according to a State Department factsheet. It has been actively seeking components for the country’s long-range ballistic missile systems, including the SHAHEEN family of missiles, which are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists suggests that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal now consists of approximately 170 warheads. The country conducted its first nuclear test back in 1998, and remains outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.The sanctions also target three private firms—Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, and Rockside Enterprise—accused of helping the NDC acquire equipment for its missile programme.“The United States will continue to act against proliferation and procurement activities that pose a concern,” Miller further added in the release.The Pakistani embassy in Washington is yet to respond to the sanctions.",The U.S. has announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme.

Pak SC conditionally allows army to announce military trial verdicts of pro-Imran protesters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sc-conditionally-allows-army-to-announce-military-trial-verdicts-of-pro-imran-protesters/articleshow/116298908.cms,"Supreme Court of Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

Bangladesh reduces ULFA leader's death sentence in weapons smuggling case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-reduces-ulfa-leaders-death-sentence-in-weapons-smuggling-case/articleshow/116442037.cms,"Representative image/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh high court on Wednesday reduced the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment in a 2004 case involving the attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).The court also acquitted a former junior minister and five others. Baruah, reportedly residing in China, had been sentenced to death in absentia in 2014. His name appears on India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ""most wanted"" list.In 2011, ULFA split into two factions. The pro-talk group, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, chose to return to Assam from ""abroad"" and engage in peace negotiations. In contrast, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Baruah, rejected the idea of negotiations.The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when authorities in Chattogram (then called Chittagong) seized ten truckloads of weapons from the premises of the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. The consignment was reportedly intended to be transported through Bangladesh to ULFA hideouts across the border in India.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, 1,100 submachine guns, 11.41 million bullets, and over 11 lakh rounds of ammunition.The high court bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar commuted Baruah's death sentence to life imprisonment. The bench also acquitted Bangladesh's former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who had earlier received capital punishment.The acquitted individuals include former DGFI (a defence intelligence agency of Bangladesh) director-general retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former industries ministry additional secretary Nurul Amin, and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The weapons were reportedly intended for ULFA and were being moved through a jetty managed by CUFL, a state-run fertilizer plant. Among those previously sentenced to death was Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director and retired brigadier general, who passed away in prison before his appeal could be heard. Nizami, also a former minister, was executed several years ago for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.Babar’s lawyer, Shishir Manir, argued that Babar had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons, and the prosecution failed to present credible evidence or reliable witnesses. Babar was also sentenced in a separate case involving a 2004 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. However, a high court bench acquitted him in that case earlier this month.The arms haul case remained dormant for years during the BNP-led government, where Jamaat-e-Islami was a coalition partner. Reports suggested that police officers involved in the seizure faced harassment, and efforts were made to suppress the investigation. The military-backed interim government in 2008 ordered a re-investigation amid these allegations. The extended probe revealed that officials from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the National Security Intelligence (NSI) oversaw the arms shipment. Chinese firm NORINCO was identified as the manufacturer of the weapons, though investigators could not trace the ship that transported the consignment to Bangladesh.In 2014, a special tribunal in Chattogram convicted 14 people, including Baruah, Babar, and Nizami, sentencing them to death. The court ruled that the consignment was part of an elaborate plan to arm ULFA militants.",Bangladesh high court reduces death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment.

A total of 10 truckloads of weapons were seized in April 2004 despite alleged efforts of certain ""influential quarters"" for its safe passage to United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) hideouts in northeastern India through Chattogram, which was then spelled as 'Chittagong'.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, over 11 lakh ammunition, 1,100 sub machine guns and 11.41 million bullets.The two-member High Court bench commuted the punishment of ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who was sentenced to death after a trial in absentia --- now assumed to be living in China --- and sentenced him to life imprisonment, said a government attorney at the bench.The High Court bench comprising Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar acquitted former state minister for home Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who were handed down capital punishment following the death reference hearing, he added.The five others to escape the gallows are former director general of forces Intelligence (DGFI) retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of a state-run fertilizer plant (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former additional secretary of industries ministry Nurul Amin and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The plant site was said to have been used for trans-shipment of weapons for ULFA.Former chief of Bangladesh 's National Security Intelligence ex-brigadier general Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director as well, was also sentenced to death but he died a normal death in prison as the appeal and death hearing process was underway.Nizami, a former minister in the past Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-Jamaat alliance government, however, was hanged several years ago on charges of crimes against humanity during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War siding with the Pakistani troops while his party was opposed to the country's independence.Babar's lawyer Shishir Manir earlier told the bench that his client had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons and the prosecution could not produce any credible evidence or trustworthy witness in support of the charges brought against him.The former junior minister was also sentenced over a 2004 grenade attack on the now deposed prime minister and the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina and her top party leaders when 24 people were killed and hundreds wounded but another High Court bench acquitted him after death reference hearing on December 1.Earlier on January 30, 2014, a special tribunal in the northeastern port city of Chattogram handed down the death penalty to 14 people, including two former ministers of the past BNP government, two ex-army generals and a top ULFA leader in the arms haul case.The trial or lower court verdict had come nearly a decade after the accidental seizure of 10 truck loads of smuggled-in weapons destined to the ULFA hideouts in northeastern India through Bangladesh territory.The two politicians to get the capital punishment were Babar and Nizami, the former Jamaat ameer and then industries minister in the same cabinet, while ULFA's fugitive military wing chief Barua was one of the convicts to be awarded the death penalty.But the case was shelved for years during the past BNP-led four-party government with Jamaat being the key-ally while police officers who seized the weapons were allegedly exposed to professional harassment.The subsequent military-backed interim regime in 2008 ordered the re-investigation amid allegations that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the then administration to suppress facts to weaken the case.The supplementary chargesheet said the weapons were brought for ULFA under the supervision of some DGFI and NSI officials while the consignment was unloaded at a government jetty in Chittagong to be reloaded in trucks destined for northeastern frontiers.Officials familiar with the investigation said their extended probe found Chinese firm NORINCO to have produced the weapons but they could not identify the ship that carried the illegal consignment to Bangladesh territory.","A Bangladeshi High Court on Wednesday commuted the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Barua to life imprisonment.

DHAKA: The Bangladesh HC scrapped on Tuesday a section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category, reports Ahsan Tasnim.

Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure. The court remarked that restoration of the caretaker govt system will pave the way for holding elections under a non-partisan govt.Tuesday's verdict scrapped the parts of the 15th Amendment Act, which scrapped the 13th amendment that had introduced the non-party caretaker govt system in 1996, and brought significant changes to the charter. The court, however, did not interfere with the provisions of the 15th Amendment Act that deal with state principles, including secularism, socialism, state region, nationalism, Father of the Nation, and number of reserved seats for women in parliament, saying that future govts will take decisions on these issues.BNP said the restoration of the caretaker govt system fulfilled people's expectations.
