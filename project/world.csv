Reckless Driving and Speeding Harassment and Unsafe Encounters

PANAGARH/CHANDERNAGORE: A high-speed car chase on national highway 2 early Monday ended in tragedy as 27-year-old dancer and event manager Sutandra Chatterjee lost her life when her vehicle overturned. Chatterjee, a resident of Chandernagore in Bengal, was traveling to Gaya in Bihar for work when the accident occurred around 12.30am. While Chatterjee, seated in the front passenger seat, bled to death, at least two of her colleagues suffered injuries. Police have seized both vehicles involved in the chase, but have yet to make any arrests.Durgapur-Asansol police commissioner Sunil Kumar Choudhary said the crash resulted from an overtaking attempt gone wrong. ""We have studied CCTV footage and have found that trouble arose when a white car, while overtaking the woman's car, grazed it. As per CCTV footage, the woman's car was chasing the other vehicle and met with the accident leading to the woman's death. We have started a case based on a complaint by one of the occupants of the car in which the woman was traveling,"" he said.Chatterjee's colleagues, including Mintu Mondal - who later lodged an FIR - and driver Rajdeo Sharma, gave a different account. They alleged that the occupants of the white car had been harassing Chatterjee before ramming their vehicle multiple times over a 10km stretch.""There were five men in the car. They constantly honked and made obscene gestures at madam while driving next to our car. They kept overtaking us and then allowing us to go ahead. They chased us till Panagarh (150km northwest of Kolkata), and in the process, there were multiple collisions between our cars. We tried to avoid them, fearing they were robbers,"" said driver Sharma.According to Mondal, the white car's occupants appeared drunk and abandoned their vehicle at the scene before fleeing. ""We crawled out of the car, but madam was bleeding and unresponsive. The youths in the white car stood there for a while but fled, leaving their vehicle behind,"" he said, claiming they had initially caught two of the men but had to release them to tend to Chatterjee.Sutandra was the sole breadwinner of her family after her father - singer Sukanta Chatterjee - died from cancer. She took care of her ailing mother and two grandmothers while managing her newly launched event management company Moonwalk, based in Gaya.Her grieving mother Tanushree rejected the police version of events and demanded immediate arrests.""I lost my husband eight months ago, and now my only child. This is not a way to die,"" she said.","Sutandra Chatterjee, 27, was traveling to Bihar for work when her vehicle overturned.

Until Monday, the rescue teams could not reach the last point and were stuck 40 meters away.Hoping against hope, the teams utilised thermocol boats to navigate the challenging terrain to bring out at least some of the workers alive but the chances of them coming out of the tunnel looked dim.If not, the teams will at least try to salvage the workers' bodies and bring them out of the tunnel, officials at the site said. As of now, the teams are still facing obstacles, with heavy water and slush hampering the rescue efforts.The eight workers, who are believed to be trapped in the last 50 meters in front of the tunnel boring machine (TBM), remained unaccounted for since the collapse of the tunnel roof on Feb 22.The project contracting agency, Jaiprakash Associates Ltd , initiated dewatering operations to clear the water from the site in the hope of finding the survivors. Officials remain cautiously optimistic that some of the workers might still be alive, though they acknowledge that they are racing against time.Telangana irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy, who was at the site, instructed the NDRF, Navy, and other agencies to work in coordination and clear the final stretch of the tunnel. ""The goal is to push the mud towards the tunnel entrance in order to locate the missing workers,"" he said and directed Jaiprakash Associates to dewater the entire tunnel by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.","The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams on Tuesday finally reached the last point of the collapsed roof.

India skips vote on Ukraine resolutions as US faces setback in UNGA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-skips-vote-on-ukraine-resolutions-as-us-faces-setback-in-unga/articleshow/118539238.cms,"The UN Security Council votes on Feb 24, 2025, at the United Nations headquarters.

Europe-backed resolution seeks withdrawal of Russian troops

Amid high drama at the UN over the 2 resolutions that were brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war – one by the US and other by Ukraine and Europe – India abstained from voting on both. Both resolutions were adopted with 93 votes in favour, as EU members seemed to prevail over the Americans in mustering support from the 193-member body for comprehensive peace and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.The voting for the US effort, which sought a swift end to the conflict, was more dramatic as the US itself abstained from voting on a resolution it had sponsored.This was because the European countries managed to successfully introduce amendments in the text. India, which maintains that it is not neutral but on the side of peace, was expected to vote in favour but the amendments meant that Indian too had to abstain.India was also among the 65 countries that abstained from voting on the Europe-backed resolution that called for just and lasting peace, and also immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. This was in line with its earlier abstentions in the Assembly on resolutions condemning Russia.India officially continues to maintain that it wants both parties involved to restart the dialogue and diplomacy process to resolve the conflict. The Trump administration has been engaging directly with Russia to end the war, keeping both EU and Ukraine out.While the defeat in the General Assembly is a setback for the US, it will look to make up for it in the Security Council, hoping that France and UK will not veto it. Both countries have not used their veto power for decades. The voting was expected to take place later in the day. With effectively just one paragraph, the US resolution seeks lasting, and not just and lasting, peace and calls for a swift end to the conflict between the 2 countries. If approved, it will be the first real resolution to be adopted by the Council on the issue since the beginning of the war. The only 1 adopted so far was days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine for a special emergency session in the Assembly on Ukraine.EU member states had sought 3 amendments in the US draft resolution, including replacing “Russia-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation”.It also called for reaffirming the UN’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters. The third was a mention of “just, lasting and comprehensive” peace and not just lasting peace. Russia’s amendment for addressing the “root causes” of the conflict was rejected.","India abstained from voting on the 2 resolutions brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war.

So as usual, let me bell the cat,"" he wrote.""Leadership ( corporate or political or any other) is about having difficult conversations. It is about trouble-shooting. It is not about living in denial; problems have to be addressed, they cannot be wished away.""You and I both know that Shashi (Tharoor) is an outstanding parliamentarian. He is probably among the only few in the country to whom the cliché, “He needs no introduction” truly applies. It is therefore disappointing that once again a great asset of the party is being forced to talk to the media to get his message through to you or the Congress leadership. Almost five years to the date, I was compelled to write an article in a national newspaper when facing a similar predicament. No problem is intractable; the key question is do we have the will to solve them in everyone’s interest? And that too quickly,"" he said in the post.""The Congress must be focused on taking on the BJP, but a prerequisite for that is to first get the house in order. This cannot become an ongoing unresolved challenge for years as it paralyses the energy and drive of the Congress workers and supporters. A challenger party has to be swift, desperate, risk-taking, hungry and on a constant prowl. It cannot be business as usual, for sure. We need to the hit the nail on the head going forward, but right now, we seem to be hitting our head on the nail,"" Jha wrote.Four-time Congress MP Tharoor appears to be growing increasingly disillusioned with the party, following what he perceives as a continued sidelining by the high command.His recent public criticism of a leadership vacuum in Kerala Congress and a meeting with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi to discuss his role in the party have fuelled speculation about his future within the organisation.","Former Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha wrote an open post for Rahul Gandhi on X.

Taylor Swift has been sacked from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl

Taylor Swift has been facing backlash from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl, according to SportsMillions. Conservative fans, including Alexis Winters of Queens, believe the drop in followers and booing signals Swift should focus on music and avoid politics.Travis Kelce, boyfriend of Taylor Swift, has gained over 12,370 followers on Instagram following his Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, according to SportsMillions, which used Social Blade to track their social media stats.Taylor Swift's Instagram following has plummeted to over 144,200 followings following the Super Bowl LIX controversy , according to SportsMillions data, causing speculation about the reasons behind the backlash.Swift's presence at the Super Bowl, where she supported her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, was met with mixed reactions. Some fans were excited to see her, while others expressed frustration, particularly those who disagree with her political stances. Some speculate it stems from her growing political influence.Alexis Winters, a member of the New York Young Republican Club, attributed the decrease in followers to a broader sentiment among certain conservative fans. ""We are tired of celebrities calling down to us from their ivory towers, giving their two cents on policies that will never impact them,"" Winters stated.She further added, ""Taylor Swift is simply the best example of this, and her loss of hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers represents the hundreds of thousands of Americans who chose their president over the woke Hollywood mob.""While Taylor Swift's Instagram followers declined, Kelce gained over 12,370 followers after the Super Bowl, according to Social Blade tracking. Some fans argue that Swift's criticism is unfair, especially when compared to Kelce's reception. ""I mostly think it's equally maddening and unsurprising how people seem more eager to celebrate the man dating a successful woman than the actual woman herself,"" said Sara Koger, 32, of Buckeye, Arizona.Jenna Piwowarczyk, a leader of the ""Swifties for Trump"" movement, expressed disappointment over Swift's treatment during the game. ""When Travis made an appearance on the Eras Tour, Swifties were excited to see him and cheered him on. When Taylor was shown on the Jumbotron, she was booed,"" Piwowarczyk noted. ""I understand the demographic of the Super Bowl attendees are not fans of Taylor Swift, but the generalized hatred towards her for simply supporting her boyfriend is uncalled for and gross.""Also read: Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole stuns in a viral Fenty ad, blending seduction and empowerment that could make Taylor Swift nervous Taylor Swift's influence remains strong, with her Eras Tour becoming the highest-grossing concert tour of all time.

Massive power blackout pushes Chile into chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/massive-power-blackout-pushes-chile-into-chaos/articleshow/118570148.cms,"Why did the blackout happen?

Present situation



A major power outage left much of Chile in darkness, disrupting daily life, halting transport, and forcing businesses to stay shut on Tuesday. The government declared a state of emergency and imposed a mandatory curfew until 6 am Wednesday, (local time) as officials scrambled to restore electricity.The blackout, which began in the late afternoon, took down the internet and mobile networks, stranded public transport, and even obstructed the country’s crucial copper mining operations. Water shortages were also reported as electric pumps failed while hospital and government buildings resorted to functioning on emergency generators.Traffic lights failed and subway services in Santiago along with other cities were put to a standstill, leaving passengers trapped in dark tunnels. Daily activities such as classes, football matches and restaurants and cinema business were also suspended, leading to revenue loss around the country.Interior minister Carolina Toha described the situation as a crisis, though the exact cause of the outage remained unclear.“Our priority is public safety,” she said, announcing that security forces had been deployed to control traffic and prevent disorder. “Obviously, this was something no one planned for.”By 10 pm, more than five hours into the blackout, none of the 14 affected regions had fully recovered electricity, leaving at least 7 million people without power.Chile’s grid operator, the National Electrical Coordinator, attributed the blackout to the failure of a disrupted high-voltage transmission line that was the backbone of the system carrying power from the Atacama desert of northern Chile to the capital in the country’s central valley. However, the exact reason for the breakdown of the grid, still remains unknown.Speaking to news agency AP, a Santiago resident Jorge Calderón described the scene as “chaos.” He worried about food spoiling in the summer heat, while others feared being trapped in lifts or stuck in their homes without working elevators.Authorities worked to evacuate people from subway stations in cities including Santiago and Valparaíso, while transport minister Juan Carlos Muñoz urged residents to stay home, warning that just merely 27 per cent of the capital’s traffic lights were functional.At Santiago International Airport, emergency power was activated, though officials cautioned that flights might be disrupted. Meanwhile, Chile’s state-owned copper giant, Codelco, also confirmed its mining operations had been severely affected by the outage.Videos circulating on social media showed scenes of confusion across Chile, a country stretching over 4,300 km (2,600 miles) along the Pacific coast. In the capital city of Santiago, people used their mobile phones as torches in the underground metro, while police were seen helping evacuate buildings.Efforts to restore electricity continued through the night, however, with millions still in darkness, the government remained on high alert.","At least 7 million people in Chile were left without power on Tuesday.

United States Vice President JD Vance recalled a heated exchange of words with a Ukrainian immigrant in the backdrop of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which broke out in February 2022.Sharing the run-in with the Ukranian-American man, Trump's deputy said immigrants must identify themselves as Americans and should look out for the interests of the United States.""During my senate campaign in 2022, I met a Ukrainian-American man in NE Ohio.

One of the most important parts of assimilation is seeing *your* country as the USA.

Vance wrote.Vance's post comes days after the United States aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a resolution condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.The move, under newly elected US President Donald Trump, has strained US-Europe ties and raised doubts about Washington’s shifting stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.The UN general assembly vote saw the US and Russia opposing a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution that directly accused Moscow of aggression and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops.

‘Tyranny of the judiciary’: Elon Musk blasts federal judge for blocking Trump’s refugee order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tyranny-of-the-judiciary-elon-musk-blasts-federal-judge-for-blocking-trumps-refugee-order/articleshow/118569781.cms,"Elon Musk

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has criticised the US judiciary following a federal judge’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s executive order pausing refugee admissions . Musk, in a post on X, questioned the judiciary’s power over presidential authority, calling it a threat to democracy.“If any judge anywhere can block every presidential order everywhere, we do not have democracy, we have tyranny of the judiciary,” Musk wrote.Musk’s remarks come after US District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a Biden-appointed judge based in Seattle, issued an injunction against Trump’s directive, which sought to indefinitely halt refugee admissions. The judge ruled that the order effectively nullified existing federal law and overstepped the president’s authority.“To be sure, the president has substantial discretion … to suspend refugee admissions, but that authority is not limitless,” Whitehead said in his ruling from the bench. “I cannot ignore Congress’ detailed framework for refugee admissions and the limits it placed on the president’s ability to suspend the same. … Our system of separated powers demands no less.”Musk’s criticism reflects growing frustration among some conservatives and Trump allies over judicial interventions in executive actions. The court’s decision is one of several recent rulings blocking key elements of Trump’s policies since his return to office. Judges have also halted his administration’s freeze on federal grants and foreign aid, as well as efforts to give Elon Musk’s allies in the Department of Government Efficiency access to vast government databases containing sensitive financial and personal data.Whitehead’s ruling, issued after a hearing on a lawsuit brought by refugees and resettlement groups, temporarily halts the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing Trump’s order. Opponents of the directive argued that it left many would-be refugees stranded overseas after they had sold their belongings in preparation for their scheduled resettlement.“The defendant agencies’ implementation of the order likely violates bedrock principles of administrative law by vastly expanding the scope of the order with no reasoned explanation [and] no advance notice,” Whitehead stated.The Justice Department has indicated that it may appeal the ruling. Government attorney August Flentje urged Whitehead to pause his injunction while the administration considers its next steps, but the judge said he would rule on that request after issuing a formal written order.Musk’s post reignited debate over the judiciary’s role in reviewing executive actions. While critics argue that judicial intervention is necessary to check presidential overreach, Musk and others see it as an impediment to governance.The US Constitution grants courts the authority to block executive orders that violate the law or the Constitution, a fundamental aspect of the separation of powers. However, Musk’s comments align with Trump’s longstanding grievances against judicial interference, particularly when it comes to immigration policy .As Trump’s administration pushes forward with its agenda, legal battles over executive authority are likely to continue, with Musk emerging as one of the most vocal critics of judicial intervention in governance.","Elon Musk has criticised the US judiciary following a judge's decision to block President Donald Trump’s executive order pausing refugee admissions. Musk, in a post on X, questioned the judiciary's power over presidential authority, calling it a threat to democracy.

""They should learn what it means to be American and recite the pledge of allegiance.

He ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 but dropped out after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses. Since then, he has strongly supported Donald Trump and his political agenda.Announcing his campaign, he said, ""I am honoured to announce my candidacy to serve as the next governor of the state of Ohio.""Ramaswamy also promised to make Ohio a leader in a ""second industrial revolution"" in the US.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump endorsed Ramaswamy, writing on Truth Social, “Vivek Ramaswamy is running for governor of Ohio.

The United Nations General Assembly on Monday saw a dramatic shift in global alliances as 17 countries, including the United States, Russia, and North Korea, voted against a nonbinding resolution condemning Russia as the aggressor in the Ukraine war. This was more than double the opposition compared to a similar resolution two years ago, highlighting growing geopolitical realignments .The resolution, backed by European nations, still passed overwhelmingly but was largely symbolic, serving as a show of solidarity with Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion.

Trump said, presenting the caps with the flair of a seasoned showman.He then teasingly singled out a journalist, questioning whether he was ""allowed"" to accept one. ""Are you allowed to take one? Because he'll consider it. I know him well. He's sort of a stiff. Brian, you're not a stiff. You're sort of a stiff guy. He'll take other things, but not a free hand. Always say yes to the president. Always say yes to the president. Would anybody like one?""Trump’s gesture comes amid growing tensions between his administration and the White House press corps. The White House recently announced it would take control of media access, stripping the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) of its long-held authority to decide which journalists cover presidential events. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the move was necessary to end the WHCA’s “monopoly” and allow access to more outlets.The decision has sparked criticism, with WHCA President Eugene Daniels warning that it undermines press freedom . ""This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States. It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president,"" Daniels said. Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich also questioned the decision, saying it gave power to the White House rather than the people.The changes come as Trump continues to feud with major media outlets. His administration recently barred the Associated Press from presidential events over a dispute regarding the naming of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” Trump has called AP a “terrible” and “radical left” organisation, while standing by his decision to rebrand the body of water. ""I'm just admiring it as I look at it. I'm getting teary-eyed,"" he remarked during a briefing, gesturing toward a map labeled ""Gulf of America.""Trump has long had a contentious relationship with the media, frequently dismissing critical coverage as “fake news.” In a recent exchange aboard Air Force One, he mocked a HuffPost reporter who asked about a controversial remark by Vice President JD Vance. “I don’t know even what you’re talking about. Neither do you. Who are you with?” Trump quipped. Upon learning the reporter was from HuffPost, he responded, “Oh, no wonder. I thought they died. Are they still around? I haven’t read them in years.

Certainly, it’s okay with me if he’d like to. He would like to sign it together with me.” He described the deal as a “very big deal.”A senior administration official, while cautioning that plans remain fluid, indicated that Zelenskyy’s visit was likely given the current diplomatic posture. The agreement reportedly involves granting the US significant stakes in Ukraine’s rare earth minerals industry, a key sector in global technology and defense production.Trump has recently escalated pressure on Zelenskyy, labelling him a “dictator” and blaming Ukraine for the war that Russia initiated in 2022. His administration initially proposed that Ukraine allocate $500 billion in future revenue to the US as de facto reparations for the military and humanitarian aid it has received. Zelenskyy rejected that offer but has continued negotiations to reach a modified deal.“We’re saying, look… we want to get that money back,” Trump said on Tuesday, again overstating the total US aid sent to Ukraine, which stands at approximately $120 billion since the war began. He falsely claimed the US had provided $350 billion in aid and that European support for Ukraine was structured as a loan, a claim widely disputed.Some of Trump’s allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), have suggested that US economic involvement in Ukraine’s mineral sector would serve as a form of security guarantee, as Washington would have a vested interest in protecting its investments. However, Trump has signaled that Europe, rather than the US, should be primarily responsible for Ukraine’s military security in the future.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to visit Washington on Friday to finalize an economic partnership with the United States.

String of aviation disasters raises alarm

January 2024: A US Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane near Washington, DC, killing 67 people.

February 2024: A medical jet plummeted into a Philadelphia street, exploding on impact and killing seven.

Last week: A Delta flight crash-landed in Toronto, flipping upside down and bursting into flames.

A terrifying near-miss at Chicago Midway Airport on Tuesday morning saw a Southwest Airlines plane come within moments of disaster, forced to abort landing at the last second as a private jet rolled across its path without authorization.Southwest Flight 2504 , a Boeing 737 inbound from Omaha, Nebraska, was mere feet from touching down when the private Challenger 350 suddenly moved onto the runway, creating a potentially catastrophic scenario.Shocking footage captured the moment the Southwest pilots had to react instantly—yanking the plane back into the air just before impact. Passengers onboard felt the engines surge as the aircraft climbed sharply to avoid a deadly crash.“The crew followed safety procedures, and the flight landed without incident,” Southwest Airlines later confirmed, though the dramatic moment left many shaken.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the unauthorized movement of the private jet, which departed for Knoxville, Tennessee, shortly after the incident. Officials are examining whether pilot error, miscommunication, or an air traffic control oversight led to the close call.While no injuries were reported, aviation experts say the event underscores growing concerns about runway safety and near-collisions at major airports.This near-disaster comes amid a wave of aviation tragedies making headlines in recent weeks:As federal investigators piece together what went wrong in Chicago, one thing is clear—the margin for error in the skies is razor-thin.","A Southwest Airlines plane was forced to abort landing at Chicago Midway Airport on Tuesday morning.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range.

The measures, which will be announced on Monday, come exactly three years after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters news agency.The UK government said the entry ban would apply to those providing “significant support” to the Russian state, including senior politicians, government officials, and business figures with access to the highest levels of power.British Security Minister Dan Jarvis sent a strong message to those targeted by the new restrictions.“You are not welcome in the UK,” he said. “The measures announced today slam the door shut to the oligarchs who have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people whilst bankrolling this illegal and unjustifiable war.”The latest move builds on existing UK sanctions against Russian elites who have supported President Vladimir Putin ’s war effort.As Britain tightens its grip on Russian influence, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit Washington on Thursday for talks with US President Donald Trump . His visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron , who will meet Trump at the White House on Monday.Both European leaders are expected to urge Trump not to push for a rushed ceasefire deal with Putin and to keep Europe involved in the diplomatic process.
