The survivor has mentioned in the complaint that classmate Wasef Ali molested her and fled when she was struggling to fight off the attackers.The maximum punishment for gang rape is 20 years in jail and for extortion, seven years in jail.Partha Ghosh, the lawyer representing the survivor, said, “We have filed an appeal that a test identification parade be done quickly.”","Sk Riyazuddin and Sk Safiq moved a plea before a local court on Sunday for permission to confess their role in the Oct 10 incident.

All eyes on HAM, RLM, VIP, CPI(ML)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kingmakers-again-can-smaller-parties-tilt-bihars-2025-election-all-eyes-on-ham-rlm-vip-cpiml/articleshow/124705980.cms,"Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM): Manjhi’s strategic muscle

Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM): Kushwaha banks on OBC base

Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP): Sahni eyes bigger role

CPI(ML): Left’s moral and electoral muscle

NEW DELHI: As Bihar heads to assembly elections on November 6 and 11, regional allies within both the National Democratic Alliance and the Mahagathbandhan are preparing to play decisive roles. While the BJP and JD(U) remain the dominant forces, smaller allies such as Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM), and Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) hold critical caste-based support bases that could influence close contests. On the other side, the Left parties, particularly the CPI(ML), are positioning themselves as a powerful voice within the opposition alliance.The state’s political landscape remains shaped by caste equations and coalition dynamics. The NDA’s seat-sharing deal saw BJP and JD(U) receive 101 seats each, while LJP (Ram Vilas) got 29, and both HAM(S) and RLM six each. Yet, murmurs of discontent have emerged, particularly within HAM, where leaders feel “undervalued.” Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan’s internal seat talks with the Left remain unresolved.For all four smaller parties, these elections are about survival, recognition, and bargaining power.Whether within the ruling alliance or the opposition bloc, each carries the weight of distinct caste identities and regional loyalties — crucial ingredients in Bihar’s complex political arithmetic.Former chief minister and Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi continues to wield quiet influence in Bihar’s NDA. The 81-year-old leader, representing the Gaya Lok Sabha seat, commands significant support among Mahadalits, particularly the Musahar community. HAM has been allotted six seats under the NDA’s seat-sharing formula, though Manjhi had demanded 15.“It is true that we have secured fewer seats, the morale of our workers is weakened, and there is deep dissatisfaction among the workers,” Manjhi said on X. However, he added that “for the pride and honour of Biharis… the NDA will triumph, and Bihar’s honour will endure.”HAM has fielded Manjhi’s daughter-in-law Deepa Kumari from Imamganj and her mother Jyoti Devi from Barachatti, drawing criticism over dynastic politics. The party defended the move, noting both women were sitting MLAs with proven records. Despite limited seats, HAM’s Dalit outreach in Magadh — where it dominates six assembly segments — could prove crucial for the NDA in a tight race.Former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha’s RLM, another NDA ally with six seats, is counting on support from the non-Yadav OBC community, particularly the Kushwahas. In 2020, the party was part of the Mahagathbandhan but has since returned to the NDA fold.“The issue of seat allocation among NDA parties has been resolved through amicable discussions,” Kushwaha said, echoing the coalition’s unified message. His wife, Snehlata, has been fielded from Sasaram — a decision defended by party spokesperson Ram Pukar Sinha as “reflective of the people’s support for her candidature.”Despite losing the 2024 Lok Sabha election from Karakat — a setback blamed on BJP rebel Pawan Singh’s independent bid — Kushwaha remains a key player among Bihar’s non-Yadav OBCs, a group the NDA is keen to consolidate.Mukesh Sahni, founder of the VIP and self-styled “Son of Mallah,” has fielded 11 candidates this time, mainly across Mithilanchal, seeking to revive his fortunes after a turbulent 2020. His party, targeting the state’s large Extremely Backward Class (EBC) vote bank, won three seats in 2020 but saw all its MLAs later defect to the BJP.This time, Sahni has declared his ambition to become deputy chief minister if the NDA returns to power. The EBC bloc, Bihar’s most populous, remains a crucial target group for both major alliances. Mithilanchal — where the BJP and JD(U) swept all seven Lok Sabha seats in 2024 — will again be a key battleground, and VIP’s performance could influence the Mahagathbandhan's final tally.On the opposition side, the CPI(ML)-Liberation continues to assert itself within the Mahagathbandhan, demanding a greater seat share after its stellar 2020 showing. The Left bloc won 16 of 29 seats it contested in 2020, with CPI(ML) alone securing 12 of 19 — a 63% strike rate.“We have maintained the spirit of coalition. Although we deserved more seats this time, we finally decided to contest only 20 assembly segments,” said CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya. CPI leader D Raja added, “Our party has a great history in Bihar and widespread presence… we should get reasonable number of seats.”As alliances settle their equations and campaigns intensify, these four smaller parties — HAM, RLM, VIP, and CPI(ML) — could once again emerge as decisive forces in a state where even a few thousand votes can determine who rules Patna.","Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) holds critical caste-based support bases that could influence close contests.

MUMBAI: Closing ranks ahead of the civic elections, the opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1 against “arbitrary and corrupt administration of Election Commission”.The announcement was made Sunday, just after Raj accused EC of inserting 96 lakh fake voters in the electoral lists across Maharashtra for the benefit of those in office. “An attempt is being made to finish off regional parties... 8-10 lakh fake voters have been added in Mumbai and 8-8.5 lakh in Thane, Pune and Nashik each,” Raj said at a party meeting.This will be the first time Congress and MNS cadres will be marching together amid rumblings in the national party’s city unit over an alliance, even though the two parties have been part of the opposition’s meeting with EC on electoral lists. Left parties have also signalled their support for the initiative aimed at bringing the opposition together and keeping the ‘vote chori’ narrative alive ahead of the local body polls.“We will soon announce the time and route of the march in Mumbai... We are going to show the entire country how Maharashtra is fighting to protect democracy,” said Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut at a joint press conference at Shiv Sena (UBT) Bhavan.The meet was attended by NCP (SP) MLA Jayant Patil, Congress functionary Sachin Sawant, MNS functionaries Bala Nandgaonkar and Abhijit Panse, and CPI functionary Prakash Reddy.Raut said people from every district who had lost their right to vote would join the march. “We will show the strength of the voters to the PM, the Union home minister and EC. It is necessary to give a jolt to EC. We also want to tell EC and the rulers in Delhi that Maharashtra is not sitting idle while so much injustice is happening,” Raut said.Raj also asked EC how it would hold local body polls without cleaning up the electoral list. Addressing MNS booth-level agents, he urged them to verify the lists to weed out fake voters. “If polls have to be held peacefully, then clean the electoral list first,” he warned. Without naming BJP, he said the party in office wanted to contest elections by adding fake names to the voters’ list. “It does not matter whether you cast a vote or not. The match has been fixed.

No undue leniency or excessive severity in sentencing: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-undue-leniency-or-excessive-severity-in-sentencing-sc/articleshow/124695123.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has cautioned trial courts and HCs against undue leniency or excessive severity while imposing punishment on a person convicted of an offence and said that deviation from this time-tested sentencing policy could erode public faith in the judiciary or lead to injustice.“Undue leniency can cause public confidence in the justice system to plummet, while excessive severity may lead to injustice,” ruled a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih while rejecting a plea for reduction of the eight-year sentence imposed on a youth who, in the heat of the moment during an altercation, struck a blow that led to the death of a man.The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister. His sister had given birth to a child on account of the sexual assault. The family of the man who raped the girl was unwilling to accede to the proposal to get the rape survivor married to him. The man was in jail on the charge of sexual assault. When the accused, with his family, was visiting the alleged rapist’s family to resolve the issue of his sister’s proposed marriage to him, an altercation broke out, in course of which the alleged rapist’s brother intervened in an effort to calm the situation.But the accused was so enraged by the sexual assault on his sister, coupled with the alleged rapist’s refusal to marry her, that he picked up an axe and gave a fatal blow to the one attempting to pacify the two sides.Senior advocate Rahul Kaushik told the court that the accused was merely 20 years old when the incident happened.Highlighting that the crime was not pre-meditated, he pleaded for leniency in sentence, which had been reduced to eight years by the HC from 10 years imposed by the trial court.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta agreed that the appellant may have been deprived of self-control because of his sister’s alleged rape at the hands of the man. But he found no sudden provocation in the circumstances to warrant the trial court's converting a murder case into a culpable homicide one.","The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister.

Rahul Gandhi Slams PM Modi After Trump Claims India Assured Him to Cut Russian Oil Imports

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of being ""frightened"" of Donald Trump , hours after the US President claimed that the PM has ""assured him that India would stop buying Russian oil"".The Congress leader said the Prime Minister ""keeps sending congratulatory messages despite repeated snubs"".""PM Modi is frightened of Trump. 1.

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India.

""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.

India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Historical context and public reactions



A call for enhanced security measures



A modern heist with deep historical echoes







A daring daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum on Sunday shocked the world, as thieves made off with eight priceless pieces of royal jewellery from the historic Apollo Gallery. The heist, which unfolded with remarkable precision and speed, was captured on video and has raised serious concerns about the security of France's cultural institutions.The robbery, described by witnesses as ""like a Hollywood movie,"" occurred shortly after the museum opened to the public. According to an AFP report, an American tourist, who was at the scene, recalled the surreal nature of the event. “It was crazy,” she said. ""They moved so quickly and casually.""The thieves, believed to be a team of four, arrived around 9:40 a.m. and targeted high-security display cases within the Apollo Gallery, which houses part of France’s crown jewels. The criminals used specialized tools, including angle grinders, to break through the glass, while visitors casually strolled by unaware.A viral clip shared by BFMTV shows one of the suspects, wearing a bright yellow vest and black hoodie, cutting through the display case as unsuspecting museum-goers pass by, seemingly oblivious to the unfolding heist. The entire operation lasted a mere seven minutes.The stolen items included exquisite jewellery from the collections of France's emperors and empresses. Among the pieces taken were:Despite the precision of the operation, the thieves were unable to steal the Empress Eugénie’s crown, which was dropped and damaged during their escape.Interior Ministry Laurent Nuñez,emphasized the historical and patrimonial value of the stolen jewels, stating, “Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value.” This loss, as much as a financial blow, represents a cultural and historical setback for both France and the world.The Louvre, renowned for housing the world’s most famous art collections, including theand the, now faces questions about its ability to safeguard such invaluable national treasures.French authorities believe the thieves were highly experienced, possibly even “foreigners” with prior knowledge of the museum’s security systems. Minister Laurent Nuñez acknowledged that the museum’s security had been a “weak spot,” highlighting the shocking ease with which the criminals bypassed existing measures. The intruders reportedly forced open a window on the Seine-facing façade, an area currently undergoing construction. Once inside, they accessed the Apollo Gallery, which houses part of France’s historic crown jewels, using a freight lift under renovation.According to Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, speaking on France Inter, the intruders “entered from the outside using a basket lift,” and the entire operation lasted seven minutes. He added that the thieves had cut the glass panes with a disc cutter and were “manifestly a team that had done scouting,” highlighting the precision and planning behind the crime.The heist, which has stunned the public, marks the first major theft at the Louvre in over 37 years. The museum had previously been the target of a high-profile theft in 1988, when a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was stolen. However, this most recent robbery stands out not only for its audacity but also for the high-profile nature of the items involved.Culture Minister Rachida Dati expressed her shock and confirmed that an investigation was already underway, with police reviewing CCTV footage and security logs in an attempt to identify the masked assailants. She vowed that no stone would be left unturned in recovering the stolen jewels.The theft has raised urgent questions about the security of cultural institutions in France, particularly the Louvre, which hosts up to 30,000 visitors a day. Experts and public figures alike are calling for a reevaluation of security measures, especially as such incidents tarnish the reputation of one of the world’s most visited and respected museums.As forensic teams continue to collect evidence, the museum remains closed to the public while authorities work to recover the stolen items. With the stolen jewels being of immense cultural and historical value, investigators are leaving no detail unchecked in hopes of bringing the thieves to justice. However, as of Monday, no arrests had been made, and the identities of the three masked assailants remain unknown.This robbery echoes the infamous 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa, which was stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. That heist exposed vulnerabilities in the Louvre’s security, vulnerabilities that seem to persist even over a century later.This latest robbery raises similar concerns about the museum’s ability to safeguard its priceless treasures. The Mona Lisa became a symbol of both cultural fascination and theft-related intrigue worldwide, and today, this heist does the same for the stolen royal jewels.","Thieves targeted high-security display cases within the Apollo Gallery, which houses part of France’s crown jewels.

The Washington Post

CNN

“You know, we’re building right behind us, we’re building a ballroom. They wanted a ballroom for 150 years, and I’m giving that honor to this wonderful place,” he said. “I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now, because right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.”

Funding and donor support for the White House Ballroom





“It will be in keeping with the White House architecture,” Trump said. “It will be appropriate in color and in window shape. There won’t be anything like it actually. … You know, a new thing is you build a super modern building next to an old-fashioned building, and I think that’s good, but I don’t have the courage to do that with the White House.”?

“I said, ‘How long will it take me?’ ‘Sir, you can start tonight, you have no approvals.’ I said, ‘You gotta be kidding.’ They said, ‘Sir, this is the White House, you’re the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.’”

Architecture, heritage, and reaction

Beyond the Ballroom: Trump’s capital vision

Construction has officially begun on President Donald J. Trump’s long-anticipated White House ballroom, a sprawling $250 million project that marks one of the most ambitious structural changes to the presidential residence in over a century. The move, confirmed through a statement posted by the White House on Truth Social, coincides with visible demolition activity on parts of the East Wing, where excavators and construction crews have been working since Monday.For the first time in the history of the White House, a permanent ballroom is being constructed on the grounds, a dream Trump said had been shared by every U.S. president for more than 150 years.“I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” the president announced in a post shared on Truth Social and reposted by the official White House account. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete! For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc.I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway, with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!”The ballroom, spanning approximately 90,000 square feet (8,300 square meters), is being built over the area that currently houses the East Wing. Renderings released by the White House depict a vast, neoclassical-style interior with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, marble floors, and three walls of arched windows overlooking the South Grounds.Demolition began on October 20, 2025, when construction crews and excavators were seen tearing down sections of the East Wing façade, including parts of the roof, entryway, and windows. Photos obtained by multiple outlets, includingand, showed visible demolition activity and portions of the structure’s interior being removed.The East Wing, which was constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942 during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, has long served as the location of the First Lady’s offices. Under Trump’s modernization plan, this wing will be “fully modernized” as part of the ballroom development. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the state ballroom will accommodate up to 650 seated guests, more than triple the capacity of the current East Room, which has historically been the largest event space in the White House.At a ceremony honoring Louisiana State University’s NCAA baseball champions in the East Room earlier Monday, Trump spoke about the construction:The president has emphasized that the ballroom’s construction will come at “zero cost to the American taxpayer,” financed entirely by private donors, major U.S. corporations, and Trump himself.During a recent White House donor dinner attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin, Trump unveiled further design plans and confirmed that the new venue will feature bulletproof glass, a 1,000-person capacity, and the ability to host a future presidential inauguration.He assured guests that the structure would align with the mansion’s historic architecture:When asked about regulatory procedures, Trump recalled:The ballroom project, estimated between $200 million and $250 million, is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s second term in January 2029.The White House stated that the ballroom will maintain the “theme and architectural heritage” of the neoclassical executive mansion. Plans call for a separate structure, adjacent but “not touching” the existing White House.“It won’t interfere with the current building,” Trump said in July. “It’ll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of. It’s my favorite place. I love it.”Still, images of the demolition sparked controversy across social media, with some critics, including one former lawmaker, calling the project an “utter desecration.” Despite the criticism, Trump’s supporters and donors have lauded the expansion as a “historic upgrade” to one of America’s most iconic buildings.The East Wing renovation marks the largest physical modification to the White House in over 80 years, rivaling the 1948 Truman reconstruction and the 1990s West Wing refurbishments.The ballroom is part of a broader effort by Trump to reimagine Washington’s landmarks and leave a symbolic architectural legacy.At a fundraiser for ballroom donors earlier this month, Trump also unveiled a 3D model of a monument called the “Arc de Trump,” designed to resemble Paris’s Arc de Triomphe. He said the arch, topped with a gold statue, will be located across from the Lincoln Memorial and will “serve as a gateway to Washington while entering via the Arlington Memorial Bridge from Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.”The Arc de Trump is proposed to commemorate the United States’ 250th anniversary in 2026 and, like the ballroom, will be privately funded by supporters.Throughout his presidency, Trump, a former real estate developer, has personally overseen numerous aesthetic and structural updates to the White House, including:","The White House ballroom is expected to be completed before the end of President Trump’s second term, in January 2029.

What Ingrassia wrote on chat?



Poll Do you think social media should censor racist remarks made by political figures? Yes, to prevent hate speech No, freedom of speech matters

Who is Paul Ingrassia?



What will happen to his nomination?







Another chat leaked from Trump administration and this time the target is US president's pick to head the Office of Special Counsel and this is also ""racist.""Paul Ingrassia, who is scheduled to hear a Senate on Thursday, made several remarks in his chat with Republicans like Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell” — and casually admitted he has a “Nazi streak. ”“MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday’ should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs,” Ingrassia wrote in January 2024, according to the chat. “Jesus Christ,” one participant responded.Using an Italian slur for Black people, Ingrassia wrote a month earlier in the group chat seen by POLITICO: “No moulignon holidays … From kwanza [sic] to mlk jr day to black history month to Juneteenth,” then added:“Every single one needs to be eviscerated.”In May 2024, the group discussed a Trump campaign staffer hired in Georgia working on outreach to minority voters when Ingrassia suggested she did not show enough deference to the Founding Fathers being white, according to the chat.“Paul belongs in the Hitler Youth with Ubergruppenfuhrer Steve Bannon,” wrote the first participant in the chat, referring to the paramilitary rank in Nazi Germany and the Republican strategist.“I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it,” Ingrassia responded, according to the chain. One group member stated that Ingrassia’s comment was not taken as a joke, and three participants opposed him during the exchange that day.Referring to white nationalist Nick Fuentes and the “Live From America” show on Rumble, a second member replied: “New LFA show coming starring Nick Fuentes & Paul Adolf Ingrassia.” To which Ingrassia wrote, “Lmao,” according to the group chat.Ingrassia made additional racist remarks, according to the chain. In January 2024, he referred to former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy as: “Never trust a chinaman or Indian” and then added: “NEVER,” the texts show.A month later, discussing why some Republicans believe Democrats portray Black people as victims, the texts show Ingrassia remarked: “Blacks behave that way because that’s their natural state … You can’t change them.” He then added: “Proof: all of Africa is a shithole, and will always be that way.”(In his first term, Trump used the term “shithole countries” to describe some African nations and Haiti.)The May 2024 discussion surrounding the “Nazi” remark became serious as Ingrassia maintained his stance. Ingrassia initially suggested that the Georgia operative should “read a book (if she’s able to) on George Washington and America’s founding,” according to the chain.“Paul you are coming across as a white nationalist which is beneficial to nobody,” a third participant in the chat replied. When Ingrassia stated that “defending our founding isn’t ‘white nationalist,’” the participant countered, saying Ingrassia “reflexively went to saying whites built the country.”“They did,” Ingrassia responded, according to the chat. This prompted the participant to reply, “You’re gunna be in private practice one day this shit will be around forever brother.” Ingrassia shared an image of paintings depicting several Founding Fathers, including Washington, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, in the chat.“We should celebrate white men and western civilisation and I will never back down from that,” he wrote, according to the chain. The third participant criticized Ingrassia’s “white nationalist” tone and suggested he was exhibiting “a tinge of racism.” The second participant then described him as “a scumbag,” to which Ingrassia allegedly replied, “Nah it’s fine … Don’t be a boomer … I don’t mind being a scumbag from time to time,” the texts show.In February 2024, Ingrassia wrote: “We need competent white men in positions of leadership. … The founding fathers were wrong that all men are created equal … We need to reject that part of our heritage,” according to the text exchange.He has ties to Fuentes and Andrew Tate, a far-right influencer charged in Britain with rape and human trafficking, which he denies.One month after the “Nazi” comment in the group chat, Ingrassia attended a rally for Fuentes but later claimed he did not know who organised the event and soon left. Fuentes did not respond to a request for comment. After Fuentes was removed from a Turning Point USA event in June 2024, Ingrassia called it “an awful decision.”He also referred to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a “psyop” a week after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. In March 2023, he stated that education should focus on “elevating the high IQ section of your demographics, so you know, basically young men, straight White men.”Paul Joseph Ingrassia is an American attorney and political commentator who, as of 2025, served as White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).He also briefly served as liaison to the Department of Justice earlier that year.Ingrassia studied mathematics and economics at Fordham University before attending Cornell Law School, where he served as senior online editor for the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy.He is known for his conservative political views and has contributed writings to outlets like National Review and The Daily Caller. Ingrassia co-hosted a podcast and gained attention for controversial political commentary frequently cited and shared by former President Donald Trump.In May-2025, Trump nominated Ingrassia to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency responsible for protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.Paul Ingrassia’s nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel is effectively blocked in the Senate, according to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who stated Monday night that “he’s not going to pass.""Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, already planning to vote against advancing Ingrassia’s nomination.Responding to inquiries about whether the White House should withdraw Ingrassia’s nomination, Thune told reporters, “I hope so,” and chuckled before adding, “He’s not going to pass.”","Paul Ingrassia, who is scheduled to hear a Senate on Thursday, made several remarks in his chat with Republicans like Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell” — and casually admitted he has a “Nazi streak. ”“MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday’ should be ended and tossed into the 7th Circle of Hell where it belongs,” he wrote in January 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124711632,imgsize-36142,width-400,resizemode-4/paul-ingrassia.jpg"

FULL: Trump’s Shocking U-turn On Tomahawks After Putin’s Call | Watch Big Russia Announcement





US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting came amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.“It’s an honour to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,” Trump said as he welcomed Zelenskyy. “We’ve gotten along really very well.” He added that his recent call with Putin had been “productive” and that he believed “something can get done” to bring peace between the two countries.Trump said both leaders Putin and Zelenskyy “don’t like each other,” calling the hostility “tremendous bad blood.” “These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everyone,” he said. “So one way or another, we’ll be involved in talks, but it might need to be in separate settings.”Asked about military aid, Trump expressed hesitation over supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is that it’s not easy for us to give massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said.“Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”He added, “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’re in it to get the war over. We’re not in it to sell weapons.” Trump’s comments came after Putin reportedly warned that supplying long-range missiles could escalate the conflict and make peace talks harder.The meeting, their third in the Oval Office and sixth this year, also included discussions on Ukraine’s proposal to store US liquefied natural gas in its facilities.Before the lunch, Trump briefly joked about Zelenskyy’s “very stylish jacket,” referring to their earlier tense February meeting where the two had clashed on live television.Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his Middle East ceasefire efforts and urged him to use that to help end the war in Ukraine. “With your support, we can stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Their army and economy are weakened, and this is a crucial moment.” He also noted that he had met with American energy and defence companies “ready to assist after the attacks on our infrastructure.”Trump, who has frequently described himself as a peacemaker, said, “I solved eight wars. I’ve saved millions and millions of lives.” Referring to India and Pakistan, he added, “That would have been a bad one. But we solved it.” He said he hoped to make Ukraine “number nine.”After meeting Zelenskyy, Trump took to Truth Social to call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. Trump said it is time to let each side “claim victory” and allow history to judge. He added that the war would never have started under his leadership and urged leaders to bring troops home so families can live in peace.He wrote: ""The meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was very interesting, and cordial, but I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide! No more shooting, no more Death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE, GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!""Speaking to journalists outside the White House after meeting President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think that Russia is afraid about Tomahawks, really afraid, because it’s a strong weapon.”","US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

On Cam: First Visuals Of Priceless Napoleon Jewels Robbed In Brazen Daylight Louvre Heist I Paris

What’s happening now?





Within a matter of four to seven minutes , thieves stole eight pieces of jewelry, which officials described as ‘incalculable’ value, from the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday. The daylight heist, which was orchestrated about 30 minutes after the opening, is among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory.Taking advantage of ongoing renovations, the thieves, disguised in workers' vests, broke into the museum before escaping swiftly on scooters on Sunday morning between 09:30 and 09:40 local time, stealing France’s historic collection of crown jewels.They stole eight items in total, which, according to the officials, include: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a reliquary brooch; Empress Eugénie’s diadem; and her large corsage-bow brooch.The thieves also tried to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife to Napoleon III, however, they abandoned it after the guards confronted them. This heavily adorned crown with 1,354 diamonds, 1,136 rose-cut diamonds, and 56 emeralds was later found outside the museum, French authorities said. It was reportedly recovered and broken.The French authorities have described the stolen pieces as ‘priceless’ and ‘of immeasurable heritage value’.Culture Minister Rachida Dati told French news outlet TF1 that the robbery was 'very professional'. Here’s a detailed view of the jewelry stolen from the Louvre museum.Among the prized possessions stolen from the Louvre museum was an exquisite diadem that belonged to Empress Eugénie. This piece features 212 pearls, 1,998 diamonds, and 992 rose-cut diamonds.Another treasured jewelry is the bow adorned with 2,438 diamonds and 196 rose-cut diamonds. The bow features bejeweled tassels and is the centerpiece of a belt; however, the museum website says there is no imagery of the finished item.A prized 19th-century imperial ensemble stolen from Louvre museum is the diamond brooch of the Empress. Called a reliquary brooch, this piece is adorned with diamonds; however, despite its name, it does not contain a relic.The thieves also stole pieces from the Sapphire set, linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense. The stolen pieces were a tiara embellished with 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds. The necklace stolen from the set has 8 sapphires, numerous diamonds, in an intricate gold setting. The thieves also stole one of the earrings. The stolen set is originally part of a larger set with brooches, a comb, and bracelets. This set is described by the website Louvre as a ‘precious testimony to Parisian jewelry.’Among the most exquisite pieces stolen are parts of Napoleonʼs emerald wedding gift set, which was added to the Louvre’s collection in 2004. This was given by Napoleon to his second wife, Marie Louise, during their marriage in 1810. The necklace has 32 emeralds and 1,138 diamonds. The set also includes emerald and diamond earrings, which were stolen.The forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, the authorities said. So, will they be able to recover the stolen jewels? The recovery could be difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again. Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance,” Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds, told AP.Meanwhile, the authorities are still looking for answers about how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance. The authorities are looking at CCTV footage, inspecting the basket lift the thieves used to get to the gallery, and the staff, who were on the site, are being interviewed.","Thieves stole eight pieces of jewelry, which officials described as ‘incalculable’ value, from the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday.

Aftermath





A high-stakes meeting meant to strengthen US-Australia ties ended in presidential fury — after Donald Trump discovered one of his guests once called him a “village idiot.”What should have been a routine diplomatic success quickly turned into an uncomfortable spectacle at the White House on October 20. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had just signed an $8.5 billion deal on rare earth minerals — a strategic agreement designed to reduce reliance on China and deepen Indo-Pacific cooperation — when the mood in the Cabinet Room suddenly shifted.Moments after the signing, Trump was asked by a Sky News Australia journalist whether he was aware that Kevin Rudd, Australia’s ambassador to Washington and a former prime minister, had spent years publicly savaging him. Rudd, now Canberra’s top diplomat in the US, had once branded Trump “the most destructive president in history,” a “traitor to the West,” a “village idiot,” and said the “general consensus” was that he was “nuts. ”Trump, visibly irritated, first tried to brush it off. “I don’t know anything about him. If he said something bad, maybe he’d like to apologise,” he said. Then, turning to Albanese, he asked: “Did an ambassador say something bad about me? Don’t tell me. Where is he? Is he still working for you?”Albanese, laughing nervously, pointed across the table — where Rudd was sitting.When Rudd raised his hand, Trump locked eyes with him and demanded: “Did you say bad?” The ambassador tried to explain that his comments were made “before I took this position,” but Trump snapped back: “I don’t like you either — and I probably never will.”The tense exchange was more than a diplomatic embarrassment. It highlighted how one of Washington’s most important alliances can be thrown off course by Trump’s famously thin skin and how personal grievances can overshadow strategic interests. Australia is a critical partner in US efforts to counter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific and a cornerstone of the AUKUS pact, which will see Canberra acquire nuclear-powered submarines with American assistance.The incident also revived memories of past diplomatic fallouts during Trump’s first term. In 2019, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, resigned after Trump branded him a “fool” and froze him out following leaked cables in which he described the administration as “inept” and “dysfunctional.” The fear now is that Rudd — whose appointment was already politically sensitive in Canberra — could face a similar fate.Personal politics meets policy: Rudd’s remarks date back to 2017, when he was leading the Asia Society think tank, but Trump’s tendency to take even old insults personally has turned them into a live diplomatic issue.A crucial alliance in the balance: The meeting was supposed to mark a reset in the US-Australia relationship after Albanese’s close ties with Joe Biden . Instead, it raised doubts about Canberra’s ability to maintain influence with an unpredictable White House.Precedent cuts both ways: Trump has a history of sidelining diplomats who criticise him, yet he’s also shown a willingness to forgive when it suits his agenda — as seen with Vice President JD Vance, who once likened him to “America’s Hitler.”Strategic stakes remain high: Despite the drama, the rare earth minerals deal and reaffirmation of AUKUS show that both nations see a shared interest in reducing Chinese dominance, particularly in critical minerals and defence.Domestic fallout in Australia: Albanese’s government, already under scrutiny for its outreach to Trump, must now reassure both voters and allies that the alliance remains robust — and that Rudd’s position in Washington is secure.Australian officials said Rudd privately apologised to Trump after the meeting, and the president accepted. But true to form, Trump reportedly repeated to aides that he “doesn’t like” the ambassador and “probably never will.”Whether that sentiment hardens into policy — or results in Rudd being sidelined — remains to be seen. What is clear is that one of America’s oldest alliances just received a stark reminder that, in the Trump era, diplomacy is often less about geopolitics and more about personal loyalty.","Donald Trump clashed with Aussie envoy Rudd over past insults, casting shadow on critical U.S.-Australia alliance talks.

Trump mocks movement





Large crowds of protesters gathered across all 50 states of the US on Saturday against President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched into its third week amid a legislative deadlock.While the protesters called the demonstration the “No Kings” movement, Republicans ridiculed it as “Hate America” rallies.Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states including Washington, Los Angeles, Montana, and several other places.More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states — from major cities such as Washington D.C. and New York to small towns across the Midwest.In San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she had never attended a protest before. Only recently, she began to view Trump as a “dictator.”“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands in Washington near the US Capitol, where the federal government remained shut for a third week amid a legislative deadlock.Demonstrators slammed what they called the Republican billionaire’s strong-arm tactics, including attacks on the media, political opponents, and undocumented immigrants.It was the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only closed federal programs and services but also tested the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces and National Guard troops into US cities — viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities — sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies leading to deportations and alleged injustices, and the government shutdown’s impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Meanwhile, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before departing for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.Trump’s campaign social media account also mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president dressed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.Republican leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”","More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states.

BANGKOK: Myanmar's military has shut down a major online scam operation near the border with Thailand, detaining more than 2,000 people and seizing dozens of Starlink satellite internet terminals, state media reported Monday.Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations responsible for bilking people all over the world. These usually involve gaining victims' confidence online with romantic ploys and bogus investment pitches.The centers are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false pretenses, promising them legitimate jobs and then holding them captive and forcing them to carry out criminal activities.Scam operations were in the international spotlight last week when the United States and Britain enacted sanctions against organisers of a major Cambodian cyberscam gang, and its alleged ringleader was indicted by a federal court in New York.According to a report in Monday's Myanma Alinn newspaper, the army raided KK Park, a well-documented cybercrime center, as part of operations starting in early September to suppress online fraud, illegal gambling, and cross-border cybercrime.It published photos displaying seized Starlink equipment and soldiers said to be carrying out the raid, though it was unclear when exactly they were taken. KK Park is located on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a major trading town on the border with Thailand in Myanmar's Kayin state. The area is only loosely under the control of Myanmar's military government, and also falls under the influence of ethnic minority militias.Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government, charged in a statement Monday night that the top leaders of the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic organisation opposed to army rule, were involved in the scam projects at KK Park.The allegation was previously made based on claims that a company backed by the Karen group allowed the land to be leased. However, the Karen, who are part of the larger armed resistance movement in Myanmar's civil war, deny any involvement in the scams.Myanma Alinn said the army ascertained that more than 260 buildings were unregistered, and seized equipment, including 30 sets of Starlink satellite internet terminals. It said 2,198 individuals were detained though it did not give their nationalities.Starlink is part of Elon Musk 's SpaceX company and the terminals link to its satellites. It does not have licensed operations in Myanmar, but at least hundreds of terminals have been smuggled into the Southeast Asian nation.The company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday but its policy bans ""conduct that is defamatory, fraudulent, obscene, or deceptive.""There have been previous crackdowns on cyberscam operations in Myanmar earlier this year and in 2023.Facing pressure from China, Thailand and Myanmar's governments launched an operation in February in which they released thousands of trafficked people from scam compounds, working with the ethnic armed groups that rule Myanmar's border areas.","Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations responsible for bilking people all over the world.

Why it matters





The legal battle so far

The politics and stakes

The big picture





A federal appeals court decision that handed Donald Trump a legal victory on deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland is now under threat — as a judge calls for a rare full-court review that could overturn it.On Monday, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that Trump has the authority to federalise Oregon’s National Guard and deploy them to Portland to “protect federal property”. The decision lifted a lower-court injunction that had blocked the move.But within hours, another Ninth Circuit judge formally requested a “vote on whether the case should be reheard” — a process known as an en banc review. That means all 29 active judges on the country’s largest appellate court will now vote on whether to reconsider the case. If they do, a new panel of 11 judges (including the chief judge) will rehear arguments.The outcome will shape the limits of presidential power over state militias — a constitutional faultline not tested in decades. If the panel’s decision stands, Trump could retain control over Oregon’s National Guard and potentially deploy them with minimal justification.Critics warn that it would hand the executive branch sweeping powers to override state authority and suppress protests under the guise of law enforcement.The initial block: District Judge Karin Immergut (a Trump appointee) halted the deployment, calling Trump’s claims of a “rebellion” in Portland “untethered to the facts”. Portland, she noted, had seen only small demonstrations outside an ICE office.Circumvention attempt: After that ruling, Trump tried to deploy federalised California National Guard troops into Oregon — prompting Immergut to issue a second order banning any such deployment.The appeal: Two Trump-appointed appellate judges, Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, overturned Immergut’s orders, saying the president likely acted within his statutory powers to federalise the Guard when “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”The dissent: Judge Susan Graber, a Clinton appointee, issued a scathing dissent, calling the decision “absurd” and a threat to core constitutional principles. She mocked government claims that Portland was a “war zone”, noting protesters often wore “chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all.”Oregon officials have united against the ruling.Governor Tina Kotek urged Trump to “send all the National Guard members home” and said there is no insurrection or public safety crisis.Attorney General Dan Rayfield warned that if the decision stands, the president would have “unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification.”The Ninth Circuit’s ideological makeup could now determine the outcome: 16 of its 29 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents, 13 by Republicans. If the full court agrees to rehear the case, the dynamics could shift dramatically.This is one of the most significant tests in decades of federal authority versus state sovereignty.The case could set a precedent on how broadly a president can interpret “rebellion” or “lawlessness” to justify deploying state troops.It’s also a bellwether for Trump’s second-term strategy of using federalised state forces to police dissent — a tactic that many legal experts say risks eroding civil liberties and the balance of power between Washington and the states.For now, Trump retains control over Oregon’s National Guard — but whether he can actually put boots on Portland’s streets will depend on how the Ninth Circuit’s next move plays out. A decision on whether to rehear the case is expected after both sides submit briefs by Wednesday midnight.","A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that Trump has the authority to federalise Oregon’s National Guard and deploy them to Portland.

'Keep fighting'







LIMA: Peru's Generation Z is leading protests against rampant crime and years of political deadlock, demanding systemic change after watching seven presidents come and go in a decade.Peruvian politics is not for the faint of heart.The country has suffered years of near-constant political crisis, corruption scandals, rising prices and deadly protests.Presidents have been impeached, charged, and forced from office. There is even a specially built jail that still houses three of them.But now a new generation of Peruvians, born since Alberto Fujimori's dictatorship ended in 2000, are now leading the calls for change.In recent days, thousands of young people have filled Lima's streets.They organise through social media and, like youth from Indonesia, Nepal and Madagascar, wave Japanese manga ""One Piece"" pirate flags while voicing their demands.In Lima, their anger erupted on October 15, when clashes with police left one person dead and about 100 injured.""This is about fighting for a future,"" Angelo Nael Genti told AFP.The 19-year-old student was beaten and hospitalised after being hit by a pellet during the crackdown.Most demonstrators are under 28 and many from poor neighborhoods.They say they feel unprotected by a state they accuse of failing to curb crime or deliver stability.Genti joined classmates from a public university for what he called a peaceful march.""They threatened me. They told me if they hadn't arrested me, they would have killed me right there,"" he said, showing bruises on his arm and head injuries.He recalls first feeling the impact of a pellet on his left leg before falling to the ground. ""About seven police officers beat and kicked me,"" he said.Videos of police aggression went viral on social media, amplifying outrage.Despite fear, Genti vows to keep protesting: ""We want to preserve this idea of struggle for the next generations.""His mother calls him a hero for fighting for Peruvians' rights.Genti hopes to finish his cultural heritage studies and possibly pursue filmmaking.The protests have no single leader but share common demands: an end to corruption, better security and jobs in a country where informal work is widespread.A constant struggle for power between lawmakers and Peru's parade of presidents has made crisis the rule, and made reforms all but impossible.Rosalinda, a 26-year-old law graduate, says she marches to ""expel criminals from power.""From a poor Lima district, she has worked and studied to survive.""Generation Z is more of a cliche,"" she said. ""I consider myself part of the working people.""She accompanied young detainees after police arrested about 20 protesters that day.All were later released for lack of legal grounds.AFP heard shouts from inside the detention center before their release: ""Let me out.""Despite fear, Rosalinda says she will keep marching: ""If I don't come back, keep fighting,"" she tells her family.Wildalr Lozano, 20, a cricket player on Peru's national team, says he joined because he feels ""unprotected"" and disconnected from the government.The movement, he adds, is about more than politics: ""I've been robbed twice, and I live in a supposedly safe district.""For many, the 'One Piece' flag symbolises unity against corrupt regimes.The manga series, which has sold hundreds of millions of copies globally, pits a band of pirates against an authoritarian global government.",Peru's Generation Z is leading protests against rampant crime and years of political deadlock.

The Trump administration announced on Saturday that two survivors from a drug-smuggling submarine destroyed in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution. Two others were killed during the strike.US President Donald Trump confirmed the action on Truth Social, saying, ""It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well-known narcotrafficking transit route. U.S. Intelligence confirmed this vessel was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics. There were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel. Two of the terrorists were killed. At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The strike took place on Thursday following a series of attacks on vessels suspected of carrying drugs.The semi-submersible submarine was intercepted after multiple previous strikes involving speedboats had killed 27 people. US Navy officials rescued the two survivors and detained them aboard a warship in international waters, marking the first time the military has held prisoners as part of Trump’s campaign against suspected drug traffickers.Trump described the attack during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding, ""We attacked a submarine and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs. Just so you understand, this was not an innocent group of people. I don’t know too many people that have submarines.""Since early September, the Trump administration has increased military operations in the Caribbean targeting drug smugglers.","Two survivors from a drug-smuggling submarine destroyed in the Caribbean will be sent back to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution.

Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting.This led to many condemnations, including that of Indian-origin Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who called the restrictions an attack on press freedom and slammed US defence secretary Pete HegsethSubramanyam posted his official statement on X, “My statement on the Administration's attacks on the First Amendment and the Pentagon Press Corps.” He also said, “Make no mistake, Secretary Hegseth's attempts to restrict reporters are an attack on freedom of the press, the First Amendment, and our democracy. The American people deserve transparency through accurate and fair reporting. Rather than attacking the messengers of his failed policies, Secretary Hegseth should instead consider doing more to support servicemembers and their families and keep our country safe.”The walkout followed new rules imposed by Hegseth that would allow the Pentagon to expel journalists for reporting on information that had not been approved for release. News organisations rejected the rules, calling them a threat to independent reporting. They see the rules as a way to spoon-feed information and control the narrative.Reporters began leaving; they carried chairs, documents, copying machines, books, and old photos to the parking lot as they handed in their badges.Around 40 to 50 journalists left the Pentagon together, reports the Associated Press.Hegseth has previously limited access to many areas of the Pentagon, held only two formal press briefings, and launched investigations into leaks to the media. He described the new rules as “common sense.""US President Donald Trump backed the new policy, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday, “I think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace. The press is very dishonest.”Several reporters posted on social media when they turned in their badges. Heather Mongilio of USNINews wrote, “It’s such a tiny thing, but I was really proud to see my picture up on the wall of Pentagon correspondents. Today, I’ll hand in my badge. The reporting will continue.”NPR reporter Tom Bowman noted that sources will continue to provide crucial information. “With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters. No one should think that’s good enough,” he said.The Pentagon Press Association, representing 101 reporters from 56 news outlets, opposed the rules. Most organisations instructed their reporters to leave rather than submit.","Dozens of journalists walked out of the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to new MAGA rules limiting their reporting. This led to many condemnations, including that of Indian-origin Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who called the restrictions an attack on press freedom and slammed US defence secretary Pete Hegseth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124669171,imgsize-810304,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

US Vice President JD Vance has stepped in to defend US defence secretary Pete Hegseth after social media was grilling him over the colour of his tie during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The row began when photos from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting at the White House showed Hegseth wearing a tie in white, blue, and red — colours that some claimed resembled the Russian tricolour flag.The photos went viral, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Special Envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, sharing Hegseth’s photo on social media alongside a Russian flag emoji, adding fuel to the fire.Vance responded to the continuous trolling on social media, slamming critics who were reading too much into the tie’s design. “Or maybe he was wearing the colors of America,” he said on X, reposting commentary from American YouTuber and former US Army officer Jake Broe, who was among the first ones to share the viral image and claiming that ""these people love Putin and Russia.""Despite Vance’s defence, most netizens remained unconvinced. Commenters argued that if the tie truly represented the American flag, it should have included stars or a different pattern.Some users even dug up an online listing for what appeared to be the same tie, described in the product details as a “Russian plain flag tie,” adding to the speculation.The photo was captured during Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on Thursday, when he met US President Donald Trump for talks that included a public briefing and a private lunch. Trump later said he intended to work with Ukraine to persuade Putin to end the war, but confirmed that Kyiv would not receive Tomahawk missiles.Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said Russia had launched drone and missile attacks on energy and transport infrastructure ahead of winter, targeting power stations, substations, and railway lines.","US Vice President JD Vance responds to criticism of Pete Hegseth's tie.

A divided US appeals court on Monday cleared the way for President Donald Trump to send National Guard troops into Portland, Oregon, overruling objections from city and state leaders.A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals approved the Justice Department’s request to stay a lower court’s order that had previously blocked the deployment, allowing the legal challenge to proceed while troops are sent, Reuters reported.A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Justice Department's request to put on hold a judge's order that had blocked the deployment while a legal challenge to Trump's action plays out.The court said that sending in the National Guard was an appropriate response to protesters, who had damaged a federal building and threatened US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The unsigned majority opinion was joined by Circuit Judge Bridget Bade and Circuit Judge Ryan Nelson, who were both appointed by Trump in his first term.Nelson also wrote a concurring opinion saying courts have no ability to even review the president's decision to send troops.Circuit Judge Susan Graber, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, dissented. She said allowing troops to be called in response to ""merely inconvenient"" protests was ""not merely absurd"" but dangerous, and she said the full 9th Circuit should overturn the ruling before Trump has a chance to send troops.""Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,"" Rayfield said. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson welcomed the ruling, saying Trump had exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel from protesters. Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to weigh his authority to send troops to Democratic-led cities, after another US appeals court ruled against his decision to send troops to Chicago.On October 4, Portland-based US District Judge Karin Immergut, who is also a Trump appointee, blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops to Portland at least until the end of October, and has scheduled a non-jury trial set to begin on October 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.Trump on September 27 had ordered 200 National Guard troops to Portland, continuing his administration's unprecedented use of military personnel in US cities to suppress protests and bolster domestic immigration enforcement. Trump called the city ""War ravaged"" and said, ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""Oregon Governor Tina Kotek has appealed to a federal appeals court to overturn a decision by a three-judge panel made on Monday, which would allow Donald Trump to deploy federalised National Guard troops to the streets of Portland, despite opposition from state and local officials, as per the Guardian.Kotek expressed her hope that the full Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will vacate the panel’s 2–1 decision, aligning with the request of the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber.“I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek told reporters. “I still urge the Trump administration to send all the National Guard members home.”","A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals approved the Justice Department's request to stay a lower court’s order that had previously blocked the deployment.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment. ""Core issues should be settled with Pakistan as per international norms, on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses to be inflicted will be beyond the imagination and calculations of those responsible for chaos and instability,"" the jihadi army chief said.Munir went on to claim that decisive responses will be made to even minor provocations and that the onus of ensuing escalations, which may bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region, will lie with India,"" he added.Referring to India and Afghanistan, with whom it is currently engaged in hostility, Munir said that the use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij (a reference to rebel groups like the BLA and TTP) as hired guns exposes its 'hypocritical and heinous' face to the world. ""Afghan Taliban regime should rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” Munir added.Claiming the minerals and rare earth deposits in Balochistan would change Pakistan's future, he said, ""The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future.""","Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric.
