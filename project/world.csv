Financial Tactics Backfire



Implications for DOGE and Tesla



The Symbolism of Wisconsin



Musk Responds



Money Can’t Buy Everything



In a closely watched and historically expensive election, liberal Judge Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel to secure a 10-year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, preserving the court’s narrow liberal majority. This outcome not only represents a significant victory for Democrats but also a deeply personal and strategic defeat for billionaire Elon Musk , who invested millions into the race in an attempt to sway its outcome.The Wisconsin Supreme Court race shattered records as the most expensive judicial election in US history, with Musk pouring over $21 million into Schimel’s campaign. Much of this funding came through Musk’s America PAC, a political action committee he established to support President Donald Trump . Musk’s contributions included direct financial backing for Schimel and controversial cash incentives for voters—offering $100 for signing petitions and $1 million checks to select individuals. Despite these efforts, Crawford emerged victorious, securing the liberal majority on the court with national implications for issues such as abortion rights, labour laws, and electoral redistricting.Elon Musk’s involvement in this race was far from incidental. As a key figure in President Donald Trump’s administration and leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has become increasingly active in shaping political outcomes. DOGE has drawn significant attention for its aggressive cost-cutting measures across federal agencies, making Musk a polarizing figure in American politics.By supporting Schimel, Musk aimed to bolster conservative judicial influence in Wisconsin—a critical swing state—and indirectly advance Trump’s agenda. The Wisconsin Supreme Court holds significant sway over issues like voting rights and redistricting, which are pivotal ahead of the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election . Losing this race undermines Musk’s ability to influence these broader political dynamics.Throughout the campaign, Democrats strategically positioned Musk as the primary antagonist, framing his substantial financial contributions as an attempt to “buy” the election. Judge Crawford and her supporters emphasized this narrative in their messaging, portraying Musk’s involvement as an unprecedented assault on democracy.In her victory speech, Crawford declared, “Today, Wisconsinites defended against an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our equitable elections, and our Supreme Court. Wisconsin has firmly declared that justice cannot be bought; our courts are not for sale.” This rhetoric resonated with voters who were wary of corporate interference in judicial matters and galvanized Democratic turnout.The race quickly became a proxy battle between Trump-aligned conservatives and Democrats at both state and national levels. While officially nonpartisan, the ideological stakes were clear: Republicans rallied behind Schimel with endorsements from Trump and Musk, while Democrats—including former President Barack Obama—supported Crawford.The election served as the first major test of public sentiment during Trump’s second term and highlighted Musk’s growing role as a political influencer. However, the loss signals resistance to both Trump’s policies and Musk’s controversial leadership at DOGE.Musk’s financial tactics drew widespread criticism from Democrats and progressive organizations. His decision to offer cash incentives—such as handing out $1 million checks to voters—was seen by many as an attempt to undermine democratic principles. These strategies ultimately backfired by energizing opposition among Democratic voters who viewed them as emblematic of corporate overreach.Despite the unprecedented spending from Musk-affiliated groups, Schimel conceded defeat on election night. During his concession speech, one voter shouted “Cheater!”—a reflection of the contentious nature of the race.The loss carries broader implications for Musk beyond politics. DOGE has faced mounting criticism over its cost-cutting initiatives, which have led to staffing reductions and decreased federal services. Crawford’s win signals growing resistance to these policies at both state and national levels.Additionally, Tesla—Musk’s flagship company—has been embroiled in legal disputes with Wisconsin over dealership rights. A conservative-leaning court could have been more favourable to Tesla’s interests, making this loss a setback for Musk’s business ambitions as well.Wisconsin holds outsized importance in American politics as a key battleground state. By investing so heavily in this race, Musk hoped to shape not just its judiciary but also broader electoral trends ahead of future contests like the 2028 presidential election.However, Crawford’s victory suggests that even vast financial resources cannot guarantee success—especially when voters perceive those resources as undermining democratic norms.Following the loss, Elon Musk took to his X platform (formerly Twitter) to express his frustration. He criticized “the long con of the left” but shifted focus to a concurrent voter ID amendment passed during the election—a small consolation amid his larger defeat. While Musk emphasized that voter ID laws were “the most important thing,” his comments underscored how sorely he felt Schimel's loss.Elon Musk’s involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race was not merely about supporting Brad Schimel; it was part of a larger strategy to cement his political influence and advance conservative priorities. The loss represents a rejection of these ambitions by Wisconsin voters—a costly lesson about the limits of money and power in American democracy. As Democrats celebrate their victory and liberals retain control of the court, questions remain about how this defeat will shape Musk’s future political endeavours. Will he recalibrate his approach or double down on similar contests? Regardless of his next move, one thing is clear: Wisconsin has sent a loud message that justice cannot be bought.","In a closely watched and historically expensive election, liberal Judge Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel to secure a 10-year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

MOHALI: Evangelical Christian pastor Bajinder Singh, founder of Rhema Assembly Church in Punjab, was sentenced Tuesday to rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh.A special court in Mohali announced the punishment after convicting the 42-year-old pastor on March 28 of raping a woman in 2018.Earlier, Singh had been involved in a murder case in the early 2000s, leading to his imprisonment. He converted from Hinduism to Christianity while in jail and later became a self-proclaimed preacher. He was arrested following the conviction in the rape case and transferred to Patiala jail.According to the woman’s testimony, she met him at a roadside eatery and later attended his prayer meetings.In Sept 2017, he called her to a restaurant in Zirakpur in Mohali district on the pretext of helping her travel abroad. He asked her to bring her pas- sport and then took her to his flat, where he drugged and raped her while recording a video.The woman testified that Singh, known as the ‘Yeshu Yeshu Prophet’ and ‘Papa-ji’, later blackmailed her using the video and extorted money.While pastor Bajinder Singh was found guilty, five other accused — Akbar Bhatti, Rajesh Chaudhary, Jatinder Kumar, Sitar Ali, and Sandeep, alias Pehlwan — were acquitted due to insufficient evidence. Another accused, Sucha Singh, died during the trial.Following the sentencing, the woman fainted outside the courtroom due to a panic attack. She regained consciousness within minutes and expressed satisfaction with the verdict, calling Singh a “fraud, bluff master, a cheater, and a hypocritical guru”.In her police statement, she recounted suffering from panic attacks and said Singh had convinced her he could heal her, only for her to face sexual exploitation instead.The verdict reinforced strict judicial action against sexual crimes: “A rapist not only causes physical injuries but more indelibly leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a girl, i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation, & not the least, her chastity.”In case of non-payment of the fine, pastor Bajinder Singh will serve an additional six months in jail. He has also been sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment each under IPC Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation), with all sentences running concurrently.During sentencing, Singh pleaded for leniency, citing personal health issues and family responsibilities.Singh also said his wife suffered from a spinal condition and he had a rod implanted in his leg. However, the court responded that the severity of his crime warranted a strict sentence.Punjab Christian Movement chief Hamid Masih said many believe the case was “micro-managed” by forces seeking to curb rapid spread of Christianity in the state.Singh’s reach extended into politics as well. Pastors in Punjab have gained influence, with politicians visiting their congregations for blessings during elections. He had issued a pointed message to Punjab govt after his FIR was registered: “I request the CM that during elections you come to us, but now you are registering cases against such big pastors. In the next election, we shall show the govt.”This intersection of faith and politics took a more structured form in April 2023 when various Christian denominations came together to form United Punjab Party. it declared support for AAP in the Jalandhar bypolls.","Bajinder Singh, founder of Rhema Assembly Church in Punjab, was sentenced Tuesday to rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh.

Read Ashley St. Clair reply here



Elon, we asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child (who you named) was even born. You refused.

And you weren’t sending *me* money, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for “disobedience.” But you’re really only punishing your son

It’s ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world. It’s all about control with you, and everyone can see it.

America needs you to grow up, you petulant man-child.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has publicly addressed claims made by conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair that he fathered her child. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk stated that he is open to taking a paternity test to confirm whether he is the father of St. Clair's six-month-old son. This marks the first time Musk has directly responded to the allegations.Elon Musk revealed that he has provided St. Clair with $2.5 million in financial support and continues to send $500,000 annually for the child's care, despite not being certain of his paternity. ""I don’t know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed,"" Musk wrote in his post.St. Clair, however, refuted Musk's claims, stating that he had previously refused to take a paternity test before the child was born. She accused Musk of withdrawing most of the financial support as a form of retaliation and control. ""You weren’t sendingmoney, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for disobedience,"" St. Clair responded on X.The feud has drawn significant public attention, with St. Clair alleging that Musk has had minimal involvement in the child's upbringing and has only met the infant three times.

The war of words between formerJustin Gaethje and former UFC two-weight division champion Conorhas once again resurfaced after the former fighter decided to address McGregor’stopic as “dumb sh*t.” This is not the first time the fighters have attempted unapologetic digs at each other. Previously, the American fighter indirectly taunted the Irish fighter after being repeatedly defeated by Dustin Poirier at UFC 257 and UFC 264.

It's true. Conor McGregor, that he is done, bro.” The duo further talked about the possibilities of McGregor actually becoming the president of Ireland. Cormier stated, “He can’t win, can he? I heard they hate him over there.” Askren replied, saying, “I guess we will figure it out.”Just seconds later, Cormier received a call from Justin Gaethje and directly jumped into asking the American fighter about his opinion on McGregor’s political venture. Gaethje was very prompt with his reply, “Daniel, stop calling me for this dumb sh*t.” He further added, “Terrible question. I don’t know sh*t about Ireland and I don’t care. America Baby” The call was cut short right after the statement. Cormier went on to admit that the popularity of the Irish fighter is indeed on a decline.“We won’t spend much time on this, as people are kind of like over McGregor.

Officers from US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), homeland security investigations, and customs and border protection arrived at Mt Baker Roofing 's warehouse in Bellingham, near the Canadian border, at around 7.30 am.Eyewitnesses described a dramatic scene as armed officers stormed the workplace. ""They arrived wielding their guns like they were going to shoot us, like we were criminals,"" said Tomas Fuerte, speaking to Cascadia Daily News.""They corralled us into a room in the back of the building. They had a list and pictures of everyone who was undocumented and took them away,"" news agency AP quoted.Fuerte, who has worked at Mt Baker Roofing for 12 years, said he had never seen anything like it before. He claimed the arrested workers were taken away in two buses.ICE spokesperson David Yost said in a statement that the raid was carried out under a federal search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into the unlawful employment of undocumented workers . He said that those detained had ""fraudulently represented their immigration status and submitted fraudulent documents and/or information to seek employment.""Mt Baker Roofing responded that it was ""fully cooperating with the authorities while also ensuring that our employees are treated fairly and respectfully under the law.""Immigration enforcement has been a politically charged issue in the United States. ICE arrested 32,809 people in the first 50 days of Donald Trump's presidency, an average of 656 per day, more than double the rate seen in the year before. However, while these figures exceed those of the Biden administration, they are still a far cry from the large-scale deportations Trump once promised. Unlike his first term, where factory and office raids were more common, recent enforcement actions have been smaller in scale.Although businesses hiring undocumented workers often face fines, criminal charges against employers remain rare.","Federal immigration agents arrest 37 workers at a roofing business in northern Washington.

The former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , recognising his contributions to human rights and democratic values.The nomination was announced by members of the Pakistan World Alliance (PWA), an advocacy organisation established in December, who are also affiliated with the Norwegian political party Partiet Sentrum.""We are pleased to announce on behalf of Partiet Sentrum that in alliance with somebody with the right to nominate, have nominated Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, to the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with human rights and democracy in Pakistan,"" Partiet Sentrum posted on X on Sunday.Previously also, Khan received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2019 for his endeavours to foster peace across South Asia.Strangely in his own country, the Centre has claimed that Imran Khan orchestrated the riots in the country.The Norwegian Nobel Committee evaluates hundreds of nominations annually through an extensive eight-month selection process before choosing a winner, according to The Express Tribune.Khan, who established Pakistan's primary opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has been in custody since August 2023.In January, authorities sentenced Khan to 14 years' imprisonment for corruption and misuse of authority charges.This verdict marked his fourth significant conviction.Higher courts have since overturned or suspended three previous convictions related to state gift sales, state secret disclosures, and marriage irregularities.Following a no-confidence vote in April 2022, Khan was removed from office. He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Bykovskaya, who remains at large, was convicted in absentia and placed on an international wanted list .In April 2022, Ukraine’s Security Service (SSU) released an audio recording of a chilling conversation between Bykovskaya and her husband, Russian paratrooper Roman Bykovsky , who was actively involved in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The woman was heard granting her husband permission to commit sexual violence against Ukrainian women—provided he “uses protection.”Investigators from Radio Liberty identified the couple, tracing them to Feodosia, occupied Crimea. Ukrainian authorities charged Bykovskaya in December 2022, leading to her eventual conviction.Bykovskaya has also been ordered to reimburse the Ukrainian state over UAH 15,000 (about $362) for forensic and legal expenses related to the case. The verdict will take effect if no appeal is filed within the designated period.Despite the evidence, both Bykovskys denied involvement. Olga deleted her social media accounts and cut off communication after being confronted by journalists.

New book exposes Biden’s exhaustion and confusion before Trump debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-book-exposes-bidens-exhaustion-and-confusion-before-trump-debate/articleshow/119923800.cms,"Joe Biden

A forthcoming book reveals that former White House chief of staff Ron Klain described former President Joe Biden as ""fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged"" ahead of his June debate with President Donald Trump. The book, ""Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,"" written by Chris Whipple, is set for release this month.According to an excerpt published by The Guardian, Klain was alarmed during an initial meeting with Biden at Aspen Lodge, the presidential retreat. ""He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it,"" Whipple wrote. ""Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.""The book details concerns among Biden’s closest aides, with Whipple arguing that they were in a ""fog of delusion and denial."" In an interview with Politico, Whipple stated, ""I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story. I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.""Biden’s preparation for the debate included two mock sessions. However, Whipple’s book claims the first practice debate, intended to last 90 minutes, was cut short after 45 minutes. ""The president’s voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject. All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term,"" the excerpt states.Klain, a longtime ally of Biden, played a key role in helping him prepare for the debate, but concerns mounted as Biden reportedly struggled during the second mock debate. ""25 minutes into the second mock debate, the president was done for the day. ‘I’m just too tired to continue and I’m afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,’"" the book quotes Klain as saying. ""‘I just need some sleep. I’ll be fine tomorrow.’ He went off to bed.""Biden’s team has not yet responded to requests for comment on the claims made in Whipple’s book.The book is one of several set to be published this year chronicling the 2024 campaign, one of the most tumultuous elections in US history. Other books, such as those by The Hill’s Amie Parnes and NBC News’ Jonathan Allen, are expected to provide additional insight into the former president’s departure from the race.Allen’s reporting suggests that former President Barack Obama was not in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris replacing Biden on the ticket, allegedly working behind the scenes to block her efforts. Meanwhile, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson are preparing to release their own book in May, titled ""Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.""The revelations in Whipple’s book add to ongoing scrutiny over Biden’s fitness for office, with his performance in the 2024 campaign becoming a central point of discussion among political analysts and voters alike.","Former White House chief of staff Ron Klain described former President Joe Biden as ""fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged"" ahead of his June debate with President Donald Trump.

Trump admin slashes Maine’s funds over trans inclusion in sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-slashes-maines-funds-over-trans-inclusion-in-sports/articleshow/119923645.cms,"File photo

Maine defies Trump order on transgender athletes, risks federal funding

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has halted federal funding to Maine, citing the state’s refusal to comply with a federal directive on gender-based participation in educational programs.The department also launched an extensive review of grants previously awarded to Maine under the Biden administration, suggesting that many were ""wasteful, redundant, or otherwise against the priorities of the Trump Administration,"" reported the Fox News.The move comes after Maine refused to enforce President Donald Trump’s executive order, issued in February, which bars transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. Secretary of Agriculture Brooks Rollins confirmed the funding freeze, emphasizing that federal dollars will only be restored if Maine aligns with Title IX protections for female athletes.“In order to continue to receive taxpayer dollars from USDA, the state of Maine must demonstrate compliance with Title IX which protects female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins stated in a letter to Maine officials.Maine’s policies regarding transgender athlete participation have been the subject of intense national debate. GOP state Rep. Laurel Libby brought renewed attention to the issue after identifying a transgender track and field athlete at Greely High School who had placed first in a girls’ pole vault competition, having previously competed in the boys’ division. Her social media post sparked widespread discussion but also led to her censure by the Democratic-controlled Maine House for allegedly identifying a minor. Libby has since taken legal action to have the censure overturned.“Governor Janet Mills and Maine Democrats have chosen to dig their heels in and embrace radical left-wing ideology over the safety and rights of Maine women and girls. Despite repeated warnings from President Trump, Maine Democrats continued to defy federal law, forcing Maine girls to unfairly compete against biological males,” Libby told Fox News Digital.“As a result, Maine’s Democrat majority has poised Maine students to lose hundreds of millions in federal funding, starting with our USDA funding, instead of championing Maine girls by adhering to federal law. I continue to stand firmly with Maine girls and President Trump in the pursuit of sanity and fairness. I implore Maine Democrats to abandon this incredibly harmful and radical gender ideology for the sake of our students.”The US Department of Education has also intervened, warning the Maine Department of Education that it has until April 11 to address the issue or face further action, including a possible referral to the Department of Justice. The Department of Health and Human Services has already referred Maine’s case to the DOJ for review.Wednesday’s decision by the USDA marks the second time this year the department has suspended funding to Maine. Last month, federal funding was temporarily withheld from the University of Maine System while officials examined its adherence to Title IX policies. That funding was reinstated days later after the university system was found to be in compliance. However, the primary controversy over transgender inclusion in sports remains at the high school level.Multiple female athletes in Maine have voiced concerns about competing against transgender students. Cassidy Carlisle, a high school student, shared her experience of being placed in a locker room with a transgender peer in middle school and later competing against another transgender athlete in Nordic skiing.“The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,” Carlisle said. “I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. … I didn't think it was happening to me.”A recent survey conducted by the American Parents Coalition found that a majority of Maine voters support restrictions on transgender participation in women’s sports. Out of approximately 600 registered voters surveyed, 63% said school sports participation should be determined by biological sex, while 66% agreed that it is “only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.” The poll also revealed that 60% of respondents—including 64% of independents and 66% of parents with children under 18—would back a ballot measure limiting female sports to biological women.More repercussions may be on the horizon for Maine as federal agencies ramp up pressure. If the state fails to meet the administration’s demands, additional sanctions could be imposed in the coming week, further threatening Maine’s access to federal resources.","USDA halts federal funding to Maine, citing the state's refusal to comply with a federal directive on gender-based participation in educational programs.

LIVE: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs

Donald Trump has unveiled sweeping new tariffs on imports, targeting a range of global economies but notably omitting Russia and North Korea from the list. The move, announced in a dramatic White House Rose Garden event, has sparked concerns over an escalating trade war .Speaking against a backdrop of American flags, Trump declared the tariffs a necessary step to protect US industries, calling the day ""Liberation Day."" The new measures include a 34% tariff on goods from China, 20% on the European Union, and 24% on Japan, with a general 10% baseline tariff for most other nations, including Britain. Trump framed the move as a way to reverse decades of economic exploitation, stating, ""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.""However, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus were not included in the tariffs. A White House official, speaking anonymously to the New York Times, explained that these countries were excluded because they already face ""extremely high tariffs and our previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries.""The announcement triggered immediate backlash. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denounced the tariffs as ""totally unwarranted,"" while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, despite her ties to Trump, called them ""wrong."" The European Union has vowed retaliation, with officials warning of countermeasures that could affect US exports.Wall Street reacted sharply to the news. The S&P index dropped 1.5% in after-hours trading, while the dollar initially fell against the euro before recovering. Businesses in the US have also raised concerns that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers and trigger a broader economic slowdown.Trump’s stance on tariffs has long been a cornerstone of his economic policy. He insists that such measures will bring a ""rebirth"" of American manufacturing and encourage companies to relocate to the US ""This is Liberation Day,"" he declared, claiming that the tariffs would ""make America wealthy again.""Key allies, however, are seeking ways to mitigate the impact. Britain, which faces a 10% tariff, launched a diplomatic effort, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally delivering an invitation from King Charles III for a state visit. Meanwhile, business leaders in affected nations are scrambling to assess the full ramifications of the new trade barriers.","US President Donald Trump announces sweeping new tariffs on imports.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Shivangini Rana

KATHMANDU: Rumours swirled in Kathmandu on Monday that two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges — a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Nepal — after police produced them in court for involvement in the March 28 pro-monarchy violence in which two persons, including a journalist, were killed. The passports of current MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana and Rabindra Mishra have been revoked, and demands to impound former king Gyanendra Shah ’s passport were raised in parliament, Rana’s family members told TOI on Monday evening.RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana, a member of the lower house, were remanded in custody for five days by Kathmandu district court judge Taradevi Maharjan. The court permitted further investigation under charges related to crimes against the state. The duo were among 11 people presented in court on Monday, said court information officer Deepak Kumar Shrestha. Mishra was handcuffed; Rana was not.Rana’s daughter Shivangini told TOI that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in Nepal and treated at the Head and Neck Cancer Institute of India in Mumbai in September. He had just completed a round of radiation therapy and was due to return to India for follow-up treatment, but was not allowed to leave. “I won’t be surprised if they (govt) slap ridiculous charges against him,” she said. “Their passports have also been impounded. Neither he nor Mishra can leave the country now. He was due for treatment in India, but it is now clear that he cannot leave Nepal anytime soon.”Shivangini added that the family had been informed verbally by officials that the passports of both leaders were being held “until further notice”, but no formal communication had been received.Meanwhile, during a session of the federal parliament on Monday, lawmakers from the ruling coalition demanded that former king Gyanendra Shah’s passport also be impounded in connection with the violent demonstrations. Rastriya Janamorcha MP Chitra Bahadur KC said that a thorough investigation into the former king’s role was “essential to protect the republic”.Ramhari Sharma Kafle, chief of the Kathmandu district public prosecutor ’s office, said Mishra, Rana and others may be charged with crimes against the state after preliminary investigation. Of the nearly 200 persons – locals, members of various political parties – arrested and detained so far, police have produced 42 people in court, including those held under charges of criminal mischief and organised crime. The rest are under further investigation, police said.According to officials, the March 28 ‘ Janadolan ’ — led by Durga Prasai’s Nepal Royalist Movement — turned violent and led to widespread vandalism in Kathmandu. Protesters allegedly damaged homes, a hospital, vehicles, and a political party office, and looted a shopping mall. They also reportedly seized a weapon from the armed police. The aam sabha was led by Prasai. Rana was called in as a moral supporter and guest. Businessman-activist Prasai was appointed its ""people’s commander"".Police said Prasai has been on the run since Friday’s protest. On Sunday, he released a video on Facebook saying he was staying in a temple in the capital. Meanwhile, police arrested Gopal Malla, 38, from Bhimsen Gola for allegedly stealing a gas gun from an armed police officer during the violence. The gun has not yet been recovered. Malla, originally from Sainamaina municipality in Rupandehi, now resides in Tarakeshwar-10, Kathmandu.In another development, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has fined Gyanendra Shah Nepalese Rs 793,000 (INR 4 lakh) for protest-related damage. Officials issued the fine over multiple infractions, including littering streets, breaking public railings and damaging fire engines used during the protest. The city police attempted to deliver the letter at Gyanendra’s estate Nirmal Niwas but were turned away by his staff. The notice was subsequently sent by post.Shivangini added that Rana was among the few MPs to oppose foreign influence in Nepal’s political affairs. “In Parliament, he was the only MP who spoke against over 100 million dollars that came into Nepal to promote secularism and conversion,” she said, referencing remarks made by former US president Donald Trump.According to Shivangini, her father supports restoring Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. “He believes bringing back the monarchy and Hindu Rashtra can restore dignity and unite the people. The current democratic system and elected parties have failed the country. He always says, ‘To change the situation, we must change the system.’”On the day of the protest, she said Rana was not the organiser but attended as coordinator of the Janandolan committee. “It was organised by Durga Prasai. My father was present to speak, but before he could, tear gas shells landed on the stage. Everyone ran,” she said. “There were others who provoked the crowd. My father wasn’t one of them. He was unarmed, standing in the middle of the road.”Shivangini showed TOI the video footage that she said showed Rana urging protestors not to resort to violence. “Even after police began firing tear gas, he was asking people not to throw stones and trying to manage the crowd,” she said. “Yet they are talking about charging him with treason.” She said Rana’s driver was shot twice during the protest. “He was just standing next to my father. That bullet could have hit him.”She also alleged the police action was premeditated. “Officers were stationed on rooftops. As soon as we started the national anthem, tear gas rained down. The crowd hadn’t even fully gathered yet. It was all staged,” she said. “We’ve always said our protest will be peaceful, like Mahatma Gandhi’s. We don’t believe in violence.”Shivangini said the govt is deliberately building a case against her father. “There’s fear in the govt. This movement has shaken the country. People are fed up with corruption and political failure. That’s why they want to silence voices like his.”",Two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges.

"We want our guardian back, says RPP, calls for Hindu Rashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/we-want-our-guardian-back-says-rpp-calls-for-hindu-rashtra/articleshow/119834327.cms,"KATHMANDU: Swati Thapa , central committee member of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), weighs her words carefully. “The people want the king back,” she says. “Not as a ruler. As a guardian. A stabilising force. And they want Nepal restored as a Hindu rashtra . These are not political slogans anymore — they’re the people’s survival instincts.”RPP was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy. It began with four seats in the 1991 parliamentary elections and has remained a fluctuating but persistent presence in Nepali politics, often playing the role of kingmaker. In 2022, RPP secured 14 of 275 seats in the federal parliament, marking a modest resurgence. The party was part of the current coalition government until Feb 2023, when it withdrew support.Her party – from which several senior leaders have been arrested or detained – has long championed these demands: the return of a constitutional monarchy, the removal of the country’s “expensive” federal structure, and reinstatement of Nepal as a Hindu state. The return of Nepal as a Hindu rashtra is central to RPP’s vision. “This country became secular without asking its people. That’s the truth,” she said. “We believe more than 80% of Nepalis still want a Hindu state.”Thapa brushes off the concern that RPP’s agenda might alienate moderates or minorities. “This doesn’t mean discrimination (against other communities). It means protection of what’s ours. We respect every religion. But we will not lose ourselves in the process. Why must we keep apologising for our roots?” she said.She alleges that “coerced” conversions — particularly in remote and poor areas — are altering the cultural fabric of the country. “Foreign aid is being used to change who we are,” she said, naming Western agencies as enablers. “We respect all faiths. But this cannot come at the cost of Nepal’s soul.”.Former king Gyanendra Shah’s re-emergence has been a flashpoint in the country. His recent ""return"" to Kathmandu saw enormous crowds — but he remains silent. Is that silence a strategy or a missed moment? “He is not responsible for this movement. He is above all that is happening,” Thapa insisted. “And we don’t want to drag him into daily politics. But the people still revere him. They see him as someone who didn’t steal from them. Someone they can trust. So even his silence has weight.”She confirmed that RPP maintains contact with the royal family and said ""monarchy must remain above political manoeuvring"". On the tricky subject of succession — especially given public unease with Gyanendra’s son, Paras — Thapa is straightforward. “We’ve said clearly: succession should not be automatic.Thapa said, “We've been saying clearly: succession will be from the king's linage. Gyanendra might skip a generation as his has publicly said that he has no interest to rule the country. But it could be his son, grandson or someone from their family. Whatever decision will be taken that will be later after restoration of the monarchy.’When prodded that it's not really how monarchies work, she said that a member of the royal family would always wear the crown, but it would not necessarily be the eldest son. “The bloodline would be at the bottom of our list of what makes our king,” she said. “We’re not talking about bringing back direct rule. The king would be symbolic. The executive power would rest with a directly elected prime minister. But we need a figure above the fray. Someone the country can rally around.”Even if RPP succeeds, the road to restoring a monarchy, even a constitutional one, would take some time. And if not the king, then who? “There is no Plan B,” she said. “That is our honest answer. We see no other figure who can command the trust of the people. That’s why we want the monarchy — not for nostalgia, but because the republic has failed to offer us a credible alternative.”That sentiment has long existed within the party. But in recent weeks, it has found unexpected traction beyond it.What was once a political platform has spilled onto the streets. The slogans once confined to RPP rallies are now the chants of thousands. On March 28, these protests turned violent. Two people, including a journalist, died. Over a hundred were injured. More than 50 — including RPP veterans Rabindra Mishra and MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana — were arrested.“We are not leading all these protests,” Thapa clarified. “But we have given moral support to those that share our goals. This is a joint effort, driven by the public. We are not claiming ownership, and we don’t want to. That would be missing the point.”She said RPP’s movement has been non-violent, with a set calendar of demonstrations. “Our programme has always been peaceful. What happened on March 28 wasn’t who we are.” Thapa blamed state provocation. “We have footage of tear gas fired from rooftops by police in civilian clothes. The crowd was unarmed.” The party has called for a thorough investigation and continues to protest in all 77 districts.Thapa described the surge in support as driven by a profound loss of direction. “People aren’t just angry. They’re exhausted. Corruption, inflation, political instability...”When asked about the absence of political flags at rallies, she said she views it as an affirmation rather than a threat. “We’re proud to see the national flag. Even in our own programmes, we use it. It’s not about RPP. It’s about Nepal.”One of the more visible faces during the recent mobilisation has been controversial figure and former Maoist Durga Prasai, whom some have criticised for inflammatory rhetoric. “We supported the agenda he stood for,” Thapa said. “That doesn’t mean we support everything about his style. Our commitment is to peaceful protest. Anyone who wants the same future for Nepal is welcome — but not at the cost of our principles.”As the protests evolve and the govt continues its crackdown, Thapa said she and her party remain firm. “This is not a passing storm. It’s a reckoning. And it’s just beginning.”","Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy.

Chagos Islands Deal: Trump approves UK-Mauritius deal for Chagos islands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/trump-approves-uk-mauritius-deal-for-chagos-islands/articleshow/119883922.cms,"Trump approves UK-Mauritius deal for Chagos islands (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump formally approved the proposed deal between the UK and Mauritius over the future of the Chagos Islands, clearing a major hurdle for the transfer of sovereignty.Downing Street confirmed on Tuesday that the agreement is now in its final stages, with Britain and Mauritius set to negotiate the remaining details before signing a treaty.A spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said, “We are now working with the Mauritian government to finalise the deal and sign the treaty,” as quoted by The Independent.The move follows months of discussions with the US, which had an effective veto over the agreement due to the strategic importance of Diego Garcia, the largest atoll in the Indian Ocean archipelago.The agreement will see Britain cede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while leasing back Diego Garcia for an initial 99-year period, with an option to extend for another 40 years. The base, a key UK-US military asset, has played a vital role in security operations, including counterterrorism missions and regional surveillance.Trump had initially been sceptical of the plan, but when he met Starmer at the White House in February, he signalled his support. “I have a feeling it is going to work out very well,” he said at the time. “I think we will be inclined to go along with your country.”Now, his formal sign-off is expected to give the deal a smoother path to completion.However, the agreement has faced criticism from multiple fronts. Senior Republicans in the US warned that transferring the islands’ sovereignty could strengthen China’s influence in the region. At home, Starmer has come under fire from both the Conservatives, who initially launched the talks in 2022, and Reform UK, who argue that Britain is giving up a strategically vital territory unnecessarily.As per The Independent, critics have also raised concerns about the cost of the deal, which could reach as much as £18 billion. Some question why the UK is paying to lease back an airbase it already controls. Meanwhile, The Financial Times reported that UK officials reassured Washington that the agreement would not come at any expense to US taxpayers.Downing Street has not provided a timeline for the treaty’s finalisation, but sources close to the negotiations believe no further approvals are needed from Washington. The deal stems from an International Court of Justice ruling that Britain should end its sovereignty over the islands.","US President Donald Trump formally approved the proposed deal between the UK and Mauritius over the future of the Chagos Islands.

Counter-terrorism police may have produced ‘intel report’ on Hindu extremists in Britain; Bob Blackman raises it in Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/counter-terrorism-police-may-have-produced-intel-report-on-hindu-extremists-in-britain-bob-blackman-raises-it-in-parliament/articleshow/119882785.cms,"Counter-terrorism police may have produced ‘intel report’ on Hindu extremists in Britain; Bob Blackman raises it in Parliament

LONDON: The UK’s counter-terrorism police may have produced the controversial “police intelligence report” claiming that Hindu extremists are aligning with Europe’s far right, it has emerged.The Mail on Sunday had published an article at the weekend claiming it had seen a secret report “compiled by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC)” which said British Hindu extremists were forming alliances with far-right groups in Europe over their “common hatred of Muslims” and that some had met far-right activist Tommy Robinson. The report also claimed the Bollywood film “Emergency” contained “Hindutva ideology” and all this was sparking communalclashes in Britain. When TOI approached the NPCC, their spokesperson said: “You would need to contact counter-terrorism policing as this is not an NPCC report .”A spokesperson for counter-terrorism policing told TOI: “We do not comment on what may or may not be leaked documents.”Tory MP Bob Blackman raised the Mail article in the House of Commons on Monday, demanding the secret report be published so it can be scrutinised and to “make sure the blame is put where it should be”. He pointed out that during the Leicester unrest “105 Hindu homes were attacked, but no Muslim homes, and two Hindu temples were attacked, but no mosques.”Charlotte Littlewood, who wrote the first report on the Leicester unrest, which found “no evidence of any Hindutva extremism”, said: “Not a single Hindu who marched in Leicester has ever had relations with Robinson.”The Mail article includes a video of a mob of Muslim men in balaclavas descending on the Durga Bhawan Hindu Centre in Smethwick in 2022, where they attack it with bottles, missiles and fireworks, and another video of a masked man threatening “BJP and RSS Hindutva supporters”, saying they are not welcome “in the UK”. That is despite the fact the article is meant to be about Hindu extremists.Vinod Popat, convenor of Hindu Community Organisations Group Leicester, has written to the NPCC calling for the report to be made public, saying the allegations risk damaging community relations. He also said he took exception to the “repeated misuse and mischaracterisation of Hindutva”.",Counter-terrorism police may have produced ‘intel report’ on Hindu extremists in Britain; Bob Blackman raises it in Parliament.
