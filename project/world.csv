security forces

and

terrorists

— suspected to be behind the fatal May 4 ambush on an Indian Air Force convoy that left Corporal Vikky Pahade dead and four of his colleagues wounded — on Friday evening, even as searches for the attackers entered the seventh day, official sources said.

Former Pakistani army SSG commando turned

Lashkar-e-Taiba

operative Illiyas Fauji, along with two other terrorists from Pakistan — Abu Hamza and Handoon — were earlier identified as kingpins of the attack. “Illiyas Fauji is the mastermind of the attack. Terrorist Habibullah Malik, alias Sajid Jutt, is also involved, operating from Pakistan,” an official source said Thursday.

CCTV footage

from the area also captured three more

Pakistani terrorists

, whose identities are being sought by police.

Sources disclosed that Pakistan is employing drones to smuggle arms and ammunition to terrorists. “Pakistani UAVs carrying weapons were shot down in Poonch and Rajouri,” revealed an official.

Following the May 4 ambush near Shahsitar (between Surankote and Mendhar in Poonch) an intensive cordon-and-search operation was jointly launched by the Army, J&K Police and CRPF — equipped with aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs — to plug potential escape routes and track down the terrorists believed to be holed up in the general area of Surankote-Poonch (Shahsitar, Gursai, Sanai, Lasana, and Sheendara top in the Surankote belt and adjoining areas in Poonch district) spread over approximately 20km.

Sketches of Hamza and Handoon were released while a reward of Rs 20 lakh was announced for any information on their whereabouts. Sources said 26 people had been detained for questioning on suspicion of providing support to the terrorists.","A brief exchange of fire took place in Sinai Top area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district on Friday evening.

India supports UN resolution backing Palestinian bid for full membership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-supports-un-resolution-backing-palestinian-bid-for-full-membership/articleshow/110020905.cms,"NEW YORK: A resolution was passed in the United Nations with an overwhelming majority, supporting full membership of Palestine and pressing the Security Council to give ""favourable consideration"" to the bid, CNN reported.The resolution on Friday won a resounding majority of 143 votes in favour, including by India. 25 countries abstained, while nine nations, including Israel and the United States, voted against the text.Other nations that voted against the resolution were: Czechia, Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea andThe text, put forward by the United Arab Emirates, grants new privileges to the Palestinian Authority in its current capacity as a non-member observer state, and calls for the UN Security Council - which must rule on Palestinian membership - to ""reconsider the matter favourably.""""The State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations,"" it asserts.Notably, India has always reiterated its stand for a two-state solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict . While, New Delhi has condemned any terrorist attack, including the October 7 attack by Hamas, it has also called for a homeland for Palestinians.""We have supported a negotiated two-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine within secure and recognised borders, living side by side in peace with Israel,"" the Ministry of External Affairs reiterated in the Parliament in February.In his remarks before voting on Friday, Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour elaborated on the plight of Palestinians in war-torn Gaza.""As we speak, 1.4 million Palestinians in Rafah wonder if they will survive today,"" he told the assembly, referring to Israeli threats of a major attack on the densely populated city in southern Gaza, as reported by CNN.He also thanked protesters on US university campuses and abroad who have demonstrated against the Israel-Hamas war.""Our flag flies high and proud in Palestine and across the globe, and on the campus of Columbia University. It has become a symbol by all those who believe in freedom and is just ruled by all those who can no longer stand idly by in the face of such utter injustice,"" Mansour said.Israel foreign minister Israel Katz quickly condemned the resolution's passage, describing it as an ""absurd decision"" that highlights ""the structural bias of the UN"" and rewards the actions of Hamas on October 7.""The message that the UN is sending to our suffering region: violence pays off,"" he said. ""The decision to upgrade the status of Palestinians in the UN is a prize for Hamas terrorists after they committed the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.""It is pertinent to note that while a General Assembly vote cannot confer UN membership, the approved resolution does endow the Palestinian Authority with new procedural rights and privileges, CNN reported.Though, only member states can vote, the Palestinian Authority can now be seated among member states in alphabetical order, submit and introduce proposals and amendments, and co-sponsor proposals and amendments.It can also make statements and explanations of votes. It has the right to reply on behalf of a group within the UN. The Palestinian Authority can also request proposals to be put to a vote and request items to be put on the UNGA's provisional agenda.Mansour further stated that the Palestinian Authority will now request full membership from the Security Council.However, the US has already warned that it will likely veto such a request in the Security Council - a replay of its April veto of an earlier Palestinian membership request.Following the general assembly vote on Friday, US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood described the resolution text as ""unproductive,"" saying a ""durable peace"" in the Middle East would mean bundling the two-state solution with other elements, as reported by CNN.""Gaza cannot be a platform for terrorism, that there should be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and that the size of Gaza's territory should not be reduced,"" he said.Wood also suggested that the United Nations was the wrong forum for consideration of Palestinian statehood, telling the General Assembly that ""it remains the US view that the most expeditious path toward statehood and UN membership for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority.""","A resolution was passed in the United Nations with an overwhelming majority, supporting full membership of Palestine and pressing the Security Council to give ""favourable consideration"" to the bid.

Russia's killer Lancet drone are running on US AI',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russias-killer-lancet-drone-are-running-on-us-ai/articleshow/110004683.cms,"In the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russia 's utilization of the Lancet Kamikaze drone, which incorporates American AI technology , highlights complex global supply chain issues. The drone, notably equipped with Nvidia’s Jetson TX2 module, is a critical example of how Western technology, specifically from the United States, ends up in military hardware used by other nations, a report in the Asia Times said.The Lancet-3 drone, a type of loitering munition, integrates the Jetson TX2 — described by Nvidia as the most power-efficient embedded AI computing device.This technology, which includes a Pascal-family GPU and is assembled mainly in China and Taiwan, underscores the global nature of modern manufacturing and the difficulty in controlling the end-use of exported technology components.The geopolitical implications are significant. Despite regulations and export controls, critical components like the Nvidia TX2 and the Swiss-made U-Blox GPS navigation system, which is resistant to jamming and spoofing, find their ways into Russian military applications. These components are legally sold through distribution systems that do not restrict subsequent sales, including to countries like Russia, China, or Iran.This situation poses a dilemma for US policymakers. Washington has taken steps to limit the transfer of AI technology and manufacturing know-how to China, yet the effectiveness of these measures is questionable as critical technology still reaches potential adversaries. The scenario is complicated by the fact that much of the AI chip production occurs outside the United States, mainly in Taiwan, a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions and natural disasters.The Biden administration has initiated efforts to bolster domestic chip manufacturing through the Chips Act, which provides subsidies to reinvigorate US production capabilities. However, this does not address the immediate issue of AI technology proliferation abroad.The case of the Lancet drone serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by the US in maintaining control over its technological exports. As Stephen Bryen, a former deputy undersecretary of defense, notes, the ongoing use of such technology by adversaries like Russia in military conflicts is a significant concern that requires urgent attention.","The Lancet-3 drone, a type of loitering munition, integrates the Jetson TX2 — described by Nvidia as the most power-efficient embedded AI computing device.

US says Israel's use of weapons may have violated international law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-israels-use-of-weapons-may-have-violated-international-law/articleshow/110024287.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration on Friday said Israel 's use of US-supplied weapons may have violated international humanitarian law during its military operation in Gaza , in its strongest criticism to date of Israel.But the administration stopped short of a definitive assessment, saying that due to the chaos of the war in Gaza it could not verify specific instances where use of those weapons might have been involved in alleged breaches.The assessment came in a 46-page unclassified State Department report to Congress required under a new National Security Memorandum (NSM) that President Joe Biden issued in early February.The findings risk further souring ties with Israel at a time when the allies are increasingly at odds over Israel's plans to strike Rafah, a move Washington has repeatedly warned against.The Biden administration has already put a hold on one package of arms in a major policy shift and said the US was reviewing others even as it reiterated long-term support for Israel.The State Department's report included contradictions: It listed numerous credible reports of civilian harm and said Israel did not at first cooperate with Washington to boost humanitarian assistance to the enclave. But in each instance it said it could not make a definitive assessment whether any breaches of law had occurred.""Given Israel's significant reliance on US-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under NSM-20 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,"" the State Department said in the report.""Israel has not shared complete information to verify whether US defense articles covered under NSM-20 were specifically used in actions that have been alleged as violations of IHL or IHRL in Gaza, or in the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the period of the report,"" it said.Because of that, the administration said it still finds credible Israel's assurances that it is using US weapons in accordance with international law .Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said the administration had ""ducked all the hard questions"" and avoided looking closely at whether Israel's conduct should mean military aid is cut off.""This report contradicts itself because it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe violations to international law have occurred, but at the same time that says they're not finding non compliance,"" he told reporters.More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s seven-month-old assault on the Gaza Strip, say health officials in the Hamas-ruled enclave. The war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.""Excessive"" civilian harmIsrael's military conduct has come under increasing scrutiny with the soaring death toll and the level of devastation in the Gaza Strip.US officials at the State Department have been divided over the issue. Reuters reported in late April that officials in at least four bureaus inside the agency have raised serious concerns over Israel's conduct in Gaza, laying out specific examples where the country might be in breach of the law.Rights group Amnesty International in late April said US-supplied weapons provided to Israel have been used in ""serious violations"" of international humanitarian and human rights law, detailing specific cases of civilian deaths and injuries and examples of use of unlawful lethal force.The US government reviewed numerous reports that raise questions about Israel’s compliance with its legal obligations and best practices for mitigating harm to civilians, the report said.Those included Israeli strikes on civilian infrastructure, strikes in densely populated areas and others that call into question whether “expected civilian harm may have been excessive relative to the reported military objective.”According to the report released Friday, in the period after Oct. 7 Israel “did not fully cooperate” with US and other international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. But it said this did not amount to a breach of a U.S law that blocks the provision of arms to countries that restrict US humanitarian aid.It said Israel had acted to improve aid delivery since Biden warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a call early last month that Washington would withhold some arms supplies if the humanitarian situation did not improve.The report, Washington has decided to declassify, said individual violations do not necessarily disprove Israel’s commitment to international humanitarian law, as long as it takes steps to investigate and hold violators accountable.""Israel’s own concern about such incidents is reflected in the fact it has a number of internal investigations underway,"" the report said. A senior State Department official confirmed that none of those investigations had yet led to prosecutions.It also has compiled numerous instances in which humanitarian workers have been killed and military operations had taken place in protected sites but again said it was not able to reach definitive conclusions on whether US weapons were used in these occasions.",The assessment came in a 46-page unclassified State Department report to Congress.

There was suspicion against Bhave and Punalekar, but there is no evidence against them and hence, they are also being acquitted.""Judge Jadhav said, ""Admittedly except for ideological differences with deceased Dr Narendra Dabholkar, the accused no. 2 (Andure) and 3 (Kalaskar) were not having any personal enmity or rivalry with Dabholkar. The murder was committed with a very well prepared plan, which was executed by accused no. 2 and 3. Considering the economic and social status of accused no. 2 and 3, they are not the masterminds of the crime. The main mastermind behind the crime is someone else.""The judge noted, ""... it is not an exclusive act of accused no. 2 and 3, but definitely there is a preplan by masterminds. Unfortunately, the prosecution has failed to unmask them.""The court also termed the approach of the chargesheeted accused and the defence counsels in prolonging the trial as ""very strange and condemnable"". ""From unnecessary and irrelevant lengthy cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and even in the final argument, an attempt was made to tarnish the image of the deceased. At the same time, the approach of the defence was to justify the killing of Dabholkar by labelling him as anti-Hindu.""","The court found Sachin Prakashrao Andure (33) and Sharad Bhausaheb Kalaskar (28) guilty of shooting Dabholkar (69) to death around 7.20am on the Vitthal Ramji Shinde bridge near Omkareshwar temple in the Deccan Gymkhana police area.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

About the survey

NEW DELHI: A recent survey reveals significant shifts in global approval ratings for the United States, China, and Russia , with America's standing notably declining in the Middle East and parts of Europe. The Democracy Perception Index 2024, conducted by the German firm Latana for the Alliance of Democracies, reflects these changes based on responses from 53 countries.The US has experienced a downturn in approval particularly in the Middle East and Europe, largely due to its support for Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.""US popularity has taken a hit globally in 2024, particularly in MENA countries but also in Europe. At the same time, attitudes towards China and Russia have become more positive all around the world outside of Europe and the US,"" the report said.""Attitudes towards the EU have become more negative in a handful of countries since 2023, particularly in many Muslim-majority countries (Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia), but also Poland and Ukraine,"" the report added.Frederick DeVeaux, a senior researcher at Latana, noted, ""For the first time since the start of the Biden administration, many Western European countries have returned to net negative perceptions of the US."" This decline is especially pronounced in Germany, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, and Switzerland.Conversely, Russia and China have seen improvements in their international images. In regions outside of Europe, sentiments toward these nations have become increasingly positive. This is in contrast to the US, where approval has suffered.The survey also highlights differing global perspectives on economic relations and sanctions. While the European region continues to support cutting economic ties with Russia due to the Ukraine conflict, other parts of the world prefer maintaining business relationships with Moscow. Similarly, there is a division between Western countries and others regarding potential sanctions against China in the event of an invasion of Taiwan.The Democracy Perception Index is an annual survey that canvasses opinions on democracy, geopolitics, and global power players. This year's study involved approximately 63,000 respondents from various countries, providing a broad overview of current global attitudes towards these major nations.","A recent survey reveals significant shifts in global approval ratings for the United States, China, and Russia.

The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise.According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation.

The planning of this terror act was done in Afghanistan. Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan [national],"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed.Over the past few months, Pakistan has repeatedly criticised the Taliban regime in Kabul for helping terrorists carry out attacks targeting security personnel, and Chinese nationals working on projects linked to Beijing's crucial Belt and Road Initiative.Speaking at a press conference, military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif strongly condemned the acts of terrorism and assured that necessary actions were being taken to bring the facilitators to justice.Despite Pakistan's efforts for peace in the region and hosting Afghan refugees, TTP terrorists continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, he said.The DG added that Pakistan had presented concrete evidence to the Afghan interim government, but no positive progress has been made.""There is concrete evidence that TTP terrorists are still using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan ...

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

KABUL: At least 50 people, mainly women and children, were killed Friday in flash flooding that ripped through northern Afghanistan , official said, in a country highly vulnerable to climate change .A disaster management official in the northern province of Baghlan said heavy seasonal rains sparked the flooding, and residents were unprepared for the sudden rush of water.""So far, the number of dead is 50 as per the hospital authorities of Baghlan-e-Markazi district,"" said Hedayatullah Hamdard, the head of the provincial natural disaster management department, adding the toll could rise.Emergency personnel were ""searching for any possible victims under the mud and rubble, with the help of security forces from the national army and police"", Hamdard told AFP late Friday.""The weather is very gloomy right now and it might pour again,"" he added.Dozens of tents, blankets and food were provided to those who lost their homes, the official said.Video footage seen on social media showed huge torrents of muddy water swamping roads and bodies shrouded in white and black cloth.In one video clip, children are heard crying and a group of men are looking at floodwaters, in which bits of broken wood and debris from homes can be seen.Since mid-April, flash flooding and other floods have left about 100 people dead in 10 of Afghanistan's provinces, with no region entirely spared, according to authorities.Farmland has been swamped in a country where 80 percent of the more than 40 million people depend on agriculture to survive.Rains on Friday also caused heavy damages in northeastern Badakhshan province and central Ghor province, officials said.Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said authorities would provide support to those impacted by the flooding across the country.The government ""expresses its deep sympathy with the families of dead and wounded, and instructs the ministry of natural disaster management, ministries of defence and interior, and provincial authorities to spare no resource in rescue efforts"", he said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.The provincial director of natural disaster management in Badakhshan said the mountainous province had seen ""heavy financial losses in several areas... due to floods"".He added that casualties were feared in Tishkan district, where flooding had blocked a road and cut off access to an area where some 20,000 people lived.Afghanistan -- which had a relatively dry winter, making it more difficult for the soil to absorb rainfall -- is highly vulnerable to climate change.The nation, ravaged by four decades of war, is one of the poorest in the world and, according to scientists, one of the worst prepared to face the consequences of global warming .Afghanistan, which is responsible for only 0.06 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, ranks sixth on the list of countries most at risk from climate change, experts say.Half of Afghanistan's population lives under the poverty line, and 15 million people are experiencing food insecurity, according to the World Bank.","At least 50 people, mainly women and children, killed in flash flooding in Afghanistan.

Civilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/civilian-casualties-rise-in-myanmars-civil-war-as-resistance-forces-tighten-noose-around-military/articleshow/109975142.cms,"BANGKOK : Six months into an offensive against Myanmar 's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war.There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces .Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided.""When the mass of people rise up against them, I think it terrifies them,"" said Dave Eubank, a former US Special Forces soldier who founded the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid organization that has provided assistance to both combatants and civilians in Myanmar since the 1990s.""They know that hospitals, churches, schools and monasteries are important places for human care, and gathering, and symbols - and they hammer them,"" said Eubank. ""That's new.""Military forces now control less than half the country, but are holding on tenaciously to much of central Myanmar including the capital, Naypyidaw - recently targeted by drone attacks - and largest city, Yangon, and is far better armed than the resistance forces, with support from Russia and China.""People have been saying that the regime was on the brink of collapse since two weeks after the coup,"" in February 2021, said Morgan Michaels, an analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project.""On the other hand, obviously the regime is weaker than it's ever been.... so there's no doubt that it's in serious, serious trouble,"" he said.Thet Swe, a spokesman for the military government, denied that troops were targeting buildings and areas where civilians were sheltering, blaming their destruction instead on the opposition forces, without citing evidence.""The military never harmed hospitals, churches and civilians in our country,"" he told The Associated Press in an email. ""They did not use that strategy and are fighting the rebels only for the sovereignty of our country.""As the fighting has moved into more populated areas, about 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive in October, contributing to the more than 3 million internally displaced people in the country of some 56 million, according to the UN's humanitarian aid agency.With the collapse of its health care system and food supplies dwindling, 18.6 million people are in need, up 1 million from a year ago, including 6 million children, the agency said.HOW IT BEGAN Opposition in Myanmar, also known as Burma, had been growing since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, but it gained new momentum in October when major militias known collectively as the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched a joint offensive.Together, the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army - among the most powerful militias formed by Myanmar's ethnic minorities - made quick advances.As they captured huge swaths of territory largely in the north and northeast, including economically important border crossings with China and several major military bases, other ethnic armed groups sensed momentum and joined the fighting.At the same time, People's Defense Forces - armed resistance groups that support the shadow National Unity Government, which views itself as Myanmar's legitimate administration - have been increasing in number and launching their own attacks, often supported and trained by the ethnic armed militias.Both sides claim they have inflicted heavy tolls. And the military government under Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has acknowledged it is under pressure, recently reintroducing conscription to increase its ranks.That has pushed some young people into the resistance. Many more have fled to rural areas or neighboring countries to avoid fighting.With the violence across its border, China helped broker a cease-fire in Myanmar's north in January with the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the alliance's Arakan Army continues to fight in its home Rakhine state in the west and has made significant gains, while PDFs and other ethnic armed groups continue their own attacks elsewhere.THE LATEST FIGHTING The fiercest fighting in recent weeks has been in the southeast, where the main ethnic Karen fighting force, the Karen National Liberation Army, claimed in early April to have seized all the military bases in Myawaddy, the main town on the border with Thailand in Kayin state, also known as Karen state.One army battalion clung to a position beside one of Myawaddy's two bridges, assisted by the Border Guard Force, a rival Karen group that had been in charge of border area security for years, conducting lucrative business by providing protection to area casino resorts with links to organized crime.The force, which declared itself neutral in January, now controls the town with military government administrators still in place, highlighting how some militia groups still prioritize their own interests.""This is not a black and white situation. This is not the regime reconquering and reconsolidating control,"" Michaels said of the fighting in the area. ""This is the regime hanging on, keeping a foothold by the razor's edge.""Meanwhile, the military has pushed KNLA and People's Defense Forces out of Kawkareik, a strategically important town along the road that connects Myawaddy with the rest of the country.Thousands of civilians have fled Myawaddy and Kawkareik. But many civilians haven't managed to escape.At least 1,015 civilian deaths have been documented from Nov 1 through May 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks political arrests, attacks and casualties. It says 4,962 civilians have been killed overall since the military took power three years ago.The watchdog blamed the deaths on the military's increasing use of scorched-earth tactics and fighting moving into more populated areas.""The military has increasingly lost areas of control in recent months, which has only increased their use of this strategy, responding with airstrikes, shelling and so on in civilian areas,"" the AAPP said in an email.The group added that the number of civilian deaths in the recent months of fighting is likely double what it reported, if not more, but that it can't document the numbers due to the intensification of the conflict.Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the shadow National Unity Government, said the military had destroyed 343 hospitals and clinics since it took power, and that those attacks had accelerated in the last two months, though he didn't have specific details.Eubank, with the Free Burma Rangers, said he and his teams operating near the front lines have witnessed the military, known as the Tatmadaw, fighting with a "" speed and force and a viciousness that we've never seen.""But in fighting a common enemy, the resistance is showing growing unity, he said.""The Burma army is still stronger than any of these resistance groups, and if they want to bring a division or two to bear, they will win the battle, but they're not stronger than everybody else together,"" he said.WHAT COMES NEXT Whether that unity will continue if the regime falls, and if the disparate resistance forces can agree on a common path ahead for Myanmar, is an open question, Michaels said.""On one hand, Myanmar is not Syria - there is common cause in fighting the regime,"" Michaels said. ""But at the same time, as the regime has receded from some areas, there are at least indicators of potential future conflicts between groups.""He noted an incident in northern Shan state last month in which troops from two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance - the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army - traded fire over a territorial dispute. One person was injured.The groups quickly agreed to stand down, but the incident illustrates that territorial tension is real, Michaels said.An opposition politician still inside the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own safety, said Myanmar's people have a common desire for peace and stability, but the various factions still pursue their own interests.""It is hard to predict what is ahead, and they still don't have a single political direction or goal. I think there is quite a problem in this situation,"" he said.""Myanmar is now at a crossroads.""","Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains. Military forces now control less than half the country, but are holding on tenaciously to much of central Myanmar. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive in October.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109975896,imgsize-1290399,width-400,resizemode-4/109975896.jpg"
US and Philippine forces sink a ship during largescale drills in the disputed South China Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/us-and-philippine-forces-sink-a-ship-during-largescale-drills-in-the-disputed-south-china-sea/articleshow/109972767.cms,"LAOAG: US and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes Wednesday and sank a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing.Military officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's northern home province.More than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines , along with a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries, were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder. The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.It's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.Marcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.China has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.""We're under the gun,"" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.""We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?"" Romualdez said. ""We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.""China has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. It says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas. The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.China did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.After being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.Philippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.For the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.On Monday, US and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan. A small group of journalists, including from the AP, was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.""They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,"" said British Defense Attache to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.In February last year, Marcos approved a wider US military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.China strongly opposed the move, which allows US forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.China has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.""An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,"" Romualdez said.","More than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines are participating in annual combat-readiness drills.

"Rape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/rape-terror-and-death-at-sea-how-a-boat-carrying-rohingya-children-women-and-men-capsized/articleshow/109951864.cms,"MEULABOH: Huddled on board the boat, the 12-year-old girl quaked with fear.The captain and crew who she says had tortured her and three other women and girls were not finished. And the punishment for disobedience, the men warned, would be death.It was the third night that the girl and around 140 other ethnic Rohingya refugees had been trapped on the fishing boat off Indonesia 's coast.They had fled Bangladesh and their homeland of Myanmar in a bid to escape violence and terror , only to face the same at sea.The 12-year-old - identified in this story only by the initial N, because she is a sexual assault survivor - tried to hide. She had already survived a night in the captain's bedroom, where she says he and several crew members had beaten and sexually abused her.Like most of the passengers, she had survived attacks by Myanmar's military that forced her and her family to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. There, she had survived nearly seven years in violence-plagued refugee camps. And she had thus far survived this journey without her family, who hoped she'd make it to Malaysia , where she was promised as a child bride to a man she had never met.The captain ordered more girls to join him and his crew in the bedroom.""If you don't come to us,"" he shouted, ""then we will capsize this boat!""What happened next would force N and the other Rohingya on board into yet another battle for survival.For many, this would be the battle they finally lost.In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh. Another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed when the boat capsized, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Until now, little was known about why the boat capsized. This account, as told to The Associated Press in interviews with eight surviving passengers, provides the first insight into what happened.N's journey began in Bangladesh, where a series of boats ferried her and other Rohingya across the Bay of Bengal.The bedlam began, the passengers say, when they were transferred to a cramped Indonesian vessel that was supposed to take them to Indonesia. From there, they would be smuggled into Malaysia.The Indonesian captain and crew separated the men from the women and forced the men into the boat's cargo holds. Anyone who protested was beaten, says Muhammed Amin.The captain and crew - who warned they were armed, though no one saw a gun - forced N and four other women and girls into the captain's bedroom.One of the women slipped out, but N and the others were trapped. The assaults by the captain and five of his six crew lasted all night, N says.When morning dawned, N was allowed out to use the toilet. She hid among the other women, but the other three girls were abused for a second night.On the third night, the three girls emerged from the captain's room, sobbing and speechless.The captain and crew demanded fresh victims. The women refused.The captain and crew had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, the passengers say. The furious captain threatened to capsize the boat unless the women complied.Soon after, Jannat Ullah says, he saw the captain push the steering wheel with his leg.The vessel tilted violently, sending passengers tumbling. And then it smashed into a wave.In the blackness of the water, people screamed for salvation, for God, for their children.N battled her way onto the boat's overturned hull. Once again, she had managed to survive. But the three girls who were abused alongside her had not.Amin spotted the captain and three crew members swimming away.In the morning, a small fishing boat arrived, and took six people to shore.Meanwhile, worsening waves had destabilized the capsized boat, which overturned again, killing more people.Rain spared passengers death by dehydration. But as another night passed, it was clear not everyone would survive. Rahena Begum's 9-year-old daughter stopped breathing.The passengers prayed, then slid the child's body into the sea.Around 30 minutes later, Rahena says, the rescue ship finally arrived.The bodies of 12 women and three children have since been recovered off Aceh, according to the UNHCR.Although the fishing boat's crew rescued the initial six people the morning of March 20, search vessels weren't launched until that evening. Officials didn't finish rescuing the passengers until midday on March 21.Ibnu Harris Al Hussain, chief of Banda Aceh's search and rescue agency, said the rescue operation began shortly after his agency learned about the boat.""The most important thing is that we have ensured their safety when they were found,"" Hussain wrote in a message to the AP.On April 2, police announced they had arrested three crew members, plus a fourth man who was not on the boat. They were charged with people smuggling, which carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. Police are searching for the remaining crew, including the captain, who fled to Malaysia, West Aceh Police Chief Andi Kirana told the AP.Police are not considering murder charges, Kirana says, because they believe the capsize was an accident.But N and the other passengers believe the disaster was a deliberate act of revenge by a sadistic captain and crew. And for that, N says, the punishment should fit the crime.""They tortured us. They treated us like animals,"" she says. ""We want the government to treat them like animals.""Kirana also said police are not considering rape charges, because they haven't received reports of sexual assault. But N says police have never questioned her.N hopes to make it to Malaysia and to the man who wants her as his wife.Maybe then, she says, she will finally be free - though in reality, Rohingya child brides in Malaysia often become prisoners to abusive husbands.For now, all she can do is fight to survive another day.""I don't want to suffer anymore,"" she says.___Gelineau reported from Sydney.","In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh.
