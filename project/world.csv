NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for opposing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the state, which will go to the polls next year.In the heated political atmosphere of West Bengal, the SIR has futher intensified the temperature as the state BJP chief accused Mamata Banerjee of wanting to ""incite riots and provoke conflict between the Hindu and Muslim communities"".Samik Bhattacharya said the BJP's stance of ""detect and deport"" is clear and that those who had fled the nation cannot return.""CM wants to incite riots in West Bengal and provoke conflicts between Hindus and Muslims. The minority community in the state has also realised that 90% of the political killings over the past three years involve people from the minority community,"" Samik Bhattacharya told news agency ANI.He further said: ""If those who had fled the country have returned today, then this is not a brothel or a Dharamshala where anyone can enter the country. This cannot happen. Our stance is clear - detect and deport.""Adding to Samik Bhattacharya's criticism of Mamata Banerjee, BJP leader Locket Chatterjee alleged that the CM is ""misleading"" the public as she has no hope of winning the next West Bengal assembly election.""Mamata Banerjee is afraid of the deletion of fake voters' names in Bihar after the SIR.The highest number of fake voters is here.

She hinted at ""public outrage"" over the deletion of voters.""I warned the BJP, don't play with fire. Be prepared for public outrage. People of Bengal never believe you. I heard that the Union home minister said in a party meeting that we will drop many names; who is he to drop them? Today, his government is there, but tomorrow it will not be there,"" the chief minister said.Mamata Banerjee has also attacked Union home minister Amit Shah over SIR, alleging that ""he acts like acting PM"" and compared him to Mir Jafar, a military general, who betrayed Siraj ud-Daulah and helped the East India Company in the Battle of Plassey in June 1757.""He acts like an acting PM. But PM knows everything; don't trust Amit Shah always. He will be your Mir Jafar one day. Take care of this, morning shows the day,"" she said.BJP MP Biplab Kumar Deb strongly condemned West Bengal CM's remark and said, ""Ram Mandir, which is linked to our nation's identity, was built during his time.

Rajasthan anti-conversion law comes into force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajasthan-anti-conversion-law-comes-into-force/articleshow/124441417.cms,"JAIPUR: Governor Haribhau Bagde Wednesday granted assent to Rajasthan Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act, 2025, passed by the state Assembly in Sept this year. Law minister Jogaram Patel said the Act had now also been notified.Putting an end to the traditional notion of 'chat mangni-pat byaah (prompt wedding)', the new law mandates that priests or clerics inform the district administration of inter-religious weddings they are about to officiate over, at least two months in advance. The law also says individuals getting married must inform the district magistrate at least three months in advance.Failure to adhere to these mandates will lead to penalties for ""forced conversions"", including imprisonment of 7 to 14 years and fines starting at Rs 5 lakh. Penalties escalate significantly if the victim is from a protected group, such as women, minors, Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, with jail terms of up to 20 years and fines of at least Rs 10 lakh. Mass conversions could result in life imprisonment and fines not less than Rs 25 lakh.The Act stipulates that all offences will be non-bailable and will be tried exclusively in a sessions court, with repeat offenders facing life sentences and fines of up to Rs 50 lakh.Additionally, marriages conducted solely for conversion purposes will be deemed void.This was Rajasthan govt's second attempt at passing the anti-conversion law.

10 days after 6.9 earthquake that left 74 dead

This is breaking news. This will be updated as more information comes in.





A powerful earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude struck the Mindanao region of the Philippines on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings for nearby coastal areas, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface.EMSC had initially reported the earthquake's magnitude as 7.2 before revising it upward to 7.6.The US Tsunami Warning System issued an alert, warning that dangerous tsunami waves could potentially affect coastal areas within 300 kilometers of the earthquake's epicenter.Indonesia also issued a tsunami warning for northern Sulawesi and Papua regions after a strong earthquake hit the southern Philippines, Indonesia's geophysics agency said.The agency's modelling suggested there was a risk of tsunami waves as high as 50 cm hitting Indonesia's shorelines, it said in a statement.The Philippines is still grappling with the aftermath of a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that struck on September 30, claiming 74 lives and forcing thousands to evacuate in Cebu province, particularly affecting Bogo city and surrounding areas.The Philippines' location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of seismic faults around the ocean, makes it particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The country faces approximately 20 typhoons and storms annually, requiring extensive disaster response efforts from both government agencies and volunteer organizations.These natural disasters have established the Philippines as one of the world's most disaster-prone nations, demanding constant preparedness and response mechanisms.","The US Tsunami Warning System issued an alert, warning that dangerous tsunami waves could potentially affect coastal areas within 300 kilometers of the earthquake's epicenter.

What did Eric Dickerson say about Bad Bunny

Fans push back against Eric Dickerson saying music should be separate from national opinions

The announcement of Bad Bunny as the headliner for the Super Bowl LX halftime show has led to a lot of discussions, including some strong criticism from NFL Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson. Dickerson, a former running back celebrated for his record-breaking career, voiced his opinions in an interview, implying that Bad Bunny shouldn't perform if he has negative views about the United States. This reaction is linked to a wider backlash against the choice of the Puerto Rican artist, whose political remarks have attracted attention from various public figures.Eric Dickerson had a conversation with a TMZ Sports photographer at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) regarding Bad Bunny's choice for the halftime show. Dickerson admitted he had ""never heard"" of Bad Bunny and didn't know any of his songs. He noted that he had ""heard some stuff"" about comments Bad Bunny allegedly made about the United States and suggested that he should pull out of the performance if those views were correct.Specifically, Dickerson said, ""I'm from the U.S. I love my country. And if you don't like the United States, just get your a** out of here and don't come over here."" When the person reminded him that Bad Bunny is from Puerto Rico, a U.S.territory, Dickerson responded, ""I know Puerto Rico is part of the U.S. But, it's not the U.S. That's the way I look at it. That's the way I feel."" He added, ""If Bad Bunny said something about the U.S. , don't come here and perform. You know, don't come here. Stay in your country.""In the same interview, Dickerson expressed broader dissatisfaction with the NFL's decision, saying, ""I’m not surprised the NFL would do something like this. That’s how they got all that political crap. Keep his a** in Puerto Rico."" These comments were captured in a video shared widely on social media platforms like X.After Eric Dickerson’s comment went viral, he received a lot of backlash from people around the world. One user on X commented, “So let me get this straight because a man was born at a different country. He’s not allowed to perform at the [NFL]? How many artists in history band members guitarist vocalist that weren’t born in the country but were allowed to perform did they not count? Just because a person is biased doesn’t mean music is. Music is fuel for the soul. Let music be music.”While another said, “If I don't like @CAgovernor does that mean if I admit that I don't like him that I am no longer allowed to go to California, b/c by extension if I don't like someone in power or their policies that I must also hate all the people that live there and cultures that they represent?”Whole social media was filled with these sorts of comments.Also Read: “They don’t know the rule” — Jason Kelce snaps at critics as Travis Kelce’s touchdown fuels outrage in Kansas City Chiefs’ loss to Jacksonville Jaguars","NFL Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson said Bad Bunny shouldn't perform if he has negative views about the United States.

Laken Snelling’s life during house arrest



Laken Snelling faces charges and ongoing investigation

Laken Snelling, a 21-year-old former cheerleader at the University of Kentucky, is living under house arrest after police in Lexington, Kentucky, said they found a newborn baby dead in her closet. She was arrested on August 30, 2025, and charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, and hiding the birth of a baby. Court records show she was released on a $100,000 bond on September 2, 2025, and ordered to stay at home while she waits for her case to go before a grand jury.Court documents say Laken Snelling spends her daytime at her mother’s home in Morristown, Tennessee, and her nights at her father’s home in Jefferson City, Tennessee, which is about 15 miles away. She does not have to wear an ankle monitor but must follow strict home rules.On September 26, 2025, she went to court in Lexington and waived her right to a first hearing, which means the case now moves forward to a grand jury.

Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

Why is Norway on edge?







The chair of Norwegian Nobel Committee informed that the decision for Nobel Peace Prize 2025 had already been made on Monday, adding that the possible Israel-Gaza peace deal would only be considered for next year's award.The Norwegian committee has been on edge amid growing pressure from US President Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for claiming to have ended ""seven wars"". With Gaza deal in the pipeline, another one has been added to the list.This year’s decision was finalized on Monday, Bloomberg reported citing head of the independent Nobel Committee, Jorgen Watne Frydnes' interview to Norwegian tabloid VG. Speaking to public broadcaster NRK, he clarified that any potential Middle East peace deal would only be considered for next year’s award.Nominations for this year's prize closed on January 31, soon after Trump’s return to the White House. Notably, Barack Obama received the honor in 2009, only a few months into his first term as president.Trump, however, on Thursday indicated that the committee would ""find a reason"" not to give him the award.""I have no idea… Marco would tell you we settled seven wars. We're close to settling an eighth. I think we'll end up settling the Russia situation… I don't think anybody in history has settled that many.But perhaps they'll find a reason not to give it to me,” he said.Norway is on edge ahead because of intense pressure from Trump and his team, who have been aggressively lobbying for the award. Trump has publicly declared he deserves the prize, while his son Eric and the White House have amplified the campaign online — turning it into a political spectacle.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu also called for Nobel Prize for Trump. ""Give @realDonaldTrump the Nobel Peace Prize - he deserves it!"" he posted on X.This push has placed Oslo in an awkward position, as the Nobel Committee operates independently but is based in Norway. Observers fear that denying Trump the prize could trigger diplomatic tension or backlash from Washington.The Scandinavian nation is negotiating a trade deal with the US, seeking relief from a 15% tariff on its exports, while trade minister Cecilie Myrseth meets officials in Washington. There are also concerns that Trump could target Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, nearly 40% of which is invested in the US.Meanwhile, foreign minister Espen Barth Eide emphasized that the Norwegian government has no role in influencing the Nobel Committee’s decisions, Bloomberg reported.",The chair of Norwegian Nobel Committee informed that the decision for Nobel Peace Prize 2025 had already been made on Monday.

""We believe in marriage; that the best person gets the job regardless of their genetics; that you are judged not on the color of your skin but on the content of your character and your contributions. It means we believe in the rule of law,"" Ramaswamy said before touching upon the most contentious subject. ""And I say this as the proud son of legal immigrants to the United States. That means your first act of entering the country can not break the law.""""Word are not violence. Violence is violence,"" Ramaswamy said on freedom of speech, on allowing both Nick Fuentes and Jimmy Kimmel.Nikki Haley's son differed from Ramaswamy and said Liberia too has a similar constitution but Liberia is not the US.""Wrong.

LIMA: A shooting at a concert in Peru's capital may prove to be the undoing of Dina Boluarte's presidency as it laid bare the steep rise in crime that her country has experienced in recent years.Lawmakers on Thursday, just hours after the shooting, submitted to parliament five requests for a vote to remove Boluarte from office over what they argued is her government's inability to stem crime across the South American country. Unlike eight previous attempts to remove her, almost all legislative factions expressed support for the requests.Each petition now requires 56 votes from the 130-member unicameral parliament to open a debate. A measure then needs 87 votes to remove Boluarte, who took office in December 2022 after parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor.Boluarte's government has struggled to respond to the spike in crime, particularly homicides and extortion . On Wednesday, she partially blamed the situation on immigrants living in the country illegally.""This crime has been brewing for decades and has been strengthened by illegal immigration, which past administrations haven't defeated,"" she said during a military ceremony.""Instead, they've opened the doors of our borders and allowed criminals to enter everywhere... without any restrictions.""Official figures show that 6,041 people were killed between January and mid-August, the highest number during the same period since 2017. Meanwhile, extortion complaints totaled 15,989 between January and July, a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024.The country's latest presidential crisis erupted after a man opened fire and injured five people Wednesday during a concert of Peru's most popular cumbia groups, Agua Marina.Prime Minister Eduardo Arana on Thursday defended Boluarte during a crime-focused hearing before parliament, but it was not enough to dissuade lawmakers from pursuing the motions to see the president out of office.""Parliament's concerns are not resolved by addressing a request for impeachment, much less by approving it,"" Arana told lawmakers. ""We are not clinging to our positions. We are here, and we knew from the beginning that our first day here could also be our last day in office.""",A shooting at a concert in Peru may prove to be the undoing of Dina Boluarte's presidency.

Circumcision causes autism? Team Trump's new claim on Tylenol use; experts disagree,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/circumcision-causes-autism-team-trumps-new-claim-on-tylenol-use-experts-disagree/articleshow/124443780.cms,"Kennedy speaks as President Donald Trump holds a cabinet meeting at the White House (AP photo)





United States health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday courted a controversy by asserting an unproven link between circumcision, the use of Tylenol, and autism , during a meeting with president Donald Trump and Cabinet members.Kennedy claimed that infant boys who are circumcised have double the rate of autism because they are given Tylenol after the procedure.The statement appeared to reference a 2015 study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, which examined ritual circumcision and the risk of autism spectrum disorder among boys under the age of 10 in Denmark.The study found that circumcised boys were more likely to be diagnosed with autism, though researchers clearly stated they had no data on painkillers or anaesthetics used and therefore could not establish any connection to Tylenol.Experts have since noted that the study showed only correlation, not causation, and that multiple subsequent studies have found no evidence supporting a link between circumcision or Tylenol and autism.Despite this, Kennedy reiterated the claim at the Cabinet meeting, telling Trump and others: “Anybody who takes the stuff during pregnancy unless they have to is, is irresponsible. It is not proof. We're doing the studies to make the proof.”He also repeated the broader, discredited theory connecting Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism and added that those who dismissed his claims were motivated by hatred for President Trump.Kennedy described watching a TikTok video featuring a pregnant woman “gobbling Tylenol” and cursing Trump.“The level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left the political landscape and now in the realm of pathology,” he said, according to news agency AP.At one point, Kennedy also mistakenly said the woman was taking Tylenol “with a baby in her placenta,” confusing the placenta with the uterus, an anatomical inaccuracy that quickly drew ridicule online.The comments have renewed concern among medical experts that Kennedy, long known for promoting unconventional and scientifically disputed health beliefs, could undermine evidence-based public health policy as health secretary.Kennedy’s remarks came just two weeks after he stood beside Trump at the White House, where both promoted unproven and discredited theories linking Tylenol, vaccines, and autism.","Kennedy claimed that infant boys who are circumcised have double the rate of autism because they are given Tylenol after the procedure.

A federal judge on Thursday (local time) issued a temporary restraining order halting US President Donald Trump ’s directive to deploy Texas National Guard troops to Chicago, rejecting claims of a “danger of rebellion” in Illinois.District Judge April Perry, ruling from the bench, said she had seen no credible evidence to justify sending troops against the wishes of local Democratic officials, according to the. The restraining order will remain in effect for around 14 days, local broadcaster FOX 32 reported.Perry criticised the administration’s account of the situation, calling it “simply unreliable” and warning that the deployment would “only add fuel to the fire.” The federal government had argued that the troops were needed to protect immigration enforcement personnel and facilities, including an Immigration and Customs Enforcement centre in suburban Chicago that has been at the centre of protests.A lawyer for the Trump administration objected to the order in court, and Perry acknowledged that an appeal was likely. The scope of the restraining order was not immediately clear, and it has not yet been entered into the court system.The case is one of two legal battles underway over domestic troop deployments. The other involves the president’s authority to send troops into Portland, Oregon, and is pending before an appeals court panel. The rulings in these cases could have wide implications for the use of military power on US soil.Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, criticised the deployment as violating federalism and “states’ rights.” It marked the first time a Republican governor has questioned the interstate deployment of National Guard troops over a governor’s objections.Before the hearing, around 300 Illinois National Guard troops and 200 Texas troops had been activated for federal duty in Illinois. Some Texas troops had begun “actively protecting federal personnel and property,” according to US Northern Command, though specific locations were not disclosed.Tennessee National Guard troops are set to begin patrolling Memphis on Friday.

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent





The US department of justice under President Donald Trump on Thursday secured a federal grand jury indictment against New York attorney general Letitia James, charging her with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a 2023 mortgage, reported CNN.The indictment, handed down in the Eastern District of Virginia, came after an investigation dating back to May, focused on a mortgage James obtained for a property in Norfolk, Virginia, to assist her niece in buying a home. Prosecutors allege James misrepresented the property as her primary residence. In an official statement announcing the charges, US Attorney Lindsey Halligan - recently appointed to lead the Eastern Virginia office - said, “No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public’s trust,” as quoted by the outlet.James, who has been among Trump’s most outspoken critics, immediately rejected the charges as politically motivated. In a response, she called the move “nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system,”This indictment arrives closely on the heels of a federal grand jury’s decision in the same district to indict former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding - a case also widely viewed through the lens of Trump’s push to prosecute his political adversaries.Earlier, a career prosecutor in Virginia reportedly declined to proceed with charges against James, citing insufficient evidence. That standoff ended when acting US attorney Erik Siebert was removed and replaced by Halligan, who has since moved aggressively against Trump’s critics. Sources indicate the investigation scrutinizes documents James’s legal team submitted - including a power of attorney form and mortgage applications. While the power of attorney form allegedly listed the property as her primary residence, James’s lawyers argue this listing was a clerical mistake and emphasize that in other documents she stated the property “WILL NOT be my primary residence.”James had previously secured a significant civil fraud judgment against Trump and his real estate empire in New York, in which a court found the company had inflated property valuations. That ruling, which ordered over $350 million in penalties, is now on appeal. The evolving legal standoff - juxtaposed with Trump’s repeated public demands that his perceived political opponents be prosecuted - has triggered widespread concern among legal experts and lawmakers about the potential politicisation of the justice department.","Letitia James is charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a 2023 mortgage.

'Hunting ANTIFA Funders': Trump Tightens Screws On Portland Crime; Vows Action In Other US Cities





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump was holding a roundtable event with conservative influencers about antifa Wednesday when secretary of state Marco Rubio, standing in the back corner of the White House's Blue Room, caught his eye.He had news for Trump, he said, but it would have to wait until after the media left. Then Rubio passed the president a note.An AP photographer covering the event zoomed in on the handwriting on White House stationery that read, ""You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.""""I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we're very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they're gonna need me pretty quickly,"" Trump said. ""So we'll take a couple of more questions.""The influencer event had already been going on for more than an hour when Rubio first approached. The president invited him to come in, and Rubio whispered something to Trump before handing him the note.The note's urgent tone came as Trump's top Middle East adviser, Steve Witkoff, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and other senior officials joined a third day of peace talks between Israel and Hamas at an Egyptian resort Wednesday - a sign that negotiators aim to dive deeply into the toughest issues of an American plan to end the war in Gaza.Trump had kicked off the influencer event by telling assembled journalists that he planned to travel to the Middle East ""toward the end of the week"" and could even ""make the rounds"" in the region to Egypt and possibly the Gaza Strip as U.S. negotiators closed in on a deal.Still, even after Rubio passed Trump the note, Trump continued to talk to the influencers and take questions from the media as the secretary of state became visibly anxious.Nearly 10 minutes after his initial comments about leaving, Trump said: ""I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East - although I'm very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows.""""We don't want to take any chances. So we're going to go and do that,"" Trump added.He then suggested Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stay and take questions in his absence. However, Trump continued to take questions before the event finally broke up without Cabinet members remaining behind.""We're gonna get peace in the Middle East,"" Trump wrapped up by saying. ""That's what we want to do.""The public didn't have to wait all too long for the formal confirmation. At 6:51 p.m. - just about two hours after Rubio initially passed Trump the note - the president triumphantly took to his social media platform for the announcement.""I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, saying that means all hostages will be released ""very soon"" while Israel will withdraw their troops ""to an agreed upon line.""Trump added: ""This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen.

A deadly ambush by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters near the Afghan border in the early hours of Wednesday claimed the lives of at least 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two senior officers - Maj Tayyab Rahat and Lt Col Junaid Arif.The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours, though the exact number remains unclear, sources said.The latest attack comes amid rising tensions, with the TTP retaliating against the Pakistani military's support for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have gained ground in KPK of late. The ideological divide between the groups - the TTP adheres to Deobandi ideology and is anti-Pakistan, whereas groups like LeT follow the Ahle Hadith ideology and are pro-Pakistan -- is only fuelling the violence.Despite Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, a militant group trained in Deobandi madrasas and instrumental in the fight against Russian and American forces, as well as local ethnic groups like the Tajiks, the TTP has defied Islamabad's expectations by asserting its autonomy.This independence poses a potential challenge for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, particularly in its plans to establish a new base for LeT in KPK, a region considered a Taliban stronghold.The TTP has turned vocal against Pak government's directly facilitating the relocation of terror groups from POK to Khyber regions. The situation turned tense when Pakistani military launched a ""clean-up drive"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to neutralise TTP cadres in Lower Dir district, a move aimed at smoothening LeT operations. The drive, launched in June, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation.","The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

'India Is Firmly In Favour Of Free, Fair And Inclusive Elections In Bangladesh': Foreign Secy Misri





DHAKA: International and domestic rights groups on Thursday accused Muhammad Yunus-led Bangladesh's interim government of gagging dissent voices, particularly launching a crackdown on supporters of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina ""Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus , a Nobel peace laureate, is increasingly using the recently amended counterterrorism law to arrest alleged supporters of the deposed Awami League government,"" New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.The rights group urged the UN human rights team in Bangladesh to ""immediately seek the release of those arbitrarily detained and encourage the authorities to uphold rights and prosecute all those who use unlawful political violence"".Bangladesh in July signed a three-year agreement with the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights to open a mission in Dhaka ""to support the promotion and protection of human rights"".The HRW comments coincided with a Bangladesh Human Rights Support Society (HRSS) report published on Thursday expressing deep concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in the country during the first nine months of 2025.The HRSS cited persistent political violence, mob killings, attacks on journalists, and violations of freedom of expression.Yunus was sworn in as the Chief Adviser of the interim government on August 8, 2024, three days after then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime was toppled in a violent street movement dubbed the July Uprising led by Students against Discrimination (SAD).After assuming the power, he disbanded Awami League, a step which HRW said was taken ""using new authority under draconian amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act"".The ban includes prohibitions on meetings, publications, and online speech supporting the party and is being used to arrest Awami League members and peaceful activists.""Thousands have been arrested under the interim government, many on dubious murder allegations, while scores are being held under the Anti-Terrorism Act,"" the HRW said, adding that several of them alleged mistreatment in custody, including lack of access to medical care.The HRW particularly noted the arrest of 16 distinguished 1971 Liberation War veterans, journalists, academics and former bureaucrats on August 28 at a discussion in Dhaka organised by Mancha 71, a platform that celebrates Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.The report noted that one of the participants called the police for protection, but ""instead of arresting the disrupters, the police detained 16 participants in the event, some of them in their 70s and 80s"".""After initially telling family members and lawyers that they were holding the detainees for their safety, the police arrested them under the anti-terrorism law,"" the report said.The Anti-Terrorism Act was enacted in 2009 under the Awami League government, particularly to prosecute Islamist militants.Yunus has denied any restrictions on freedom of expression.The rights group alleged that the government was ""also been unable to contain conservative Muslim interest groups that have engaged in violence to press their demands, ranging from targeting alleged Awami League supporters to opposing women's rights"".Referring to the leading Bangladeshi rights group Ain o Salish Kendra (Centre for Law and Mediation or ASK), the HRW said at least 152 people were lynched in mob attacks since January.The HRW said the Bangladeshi government should stop abusing the anti-terrorism law, which is ""just becoming political repression by another name"" and ""the interim government should instead focus on creating conditions for safe and participatory elections"".According to HRSS data, at least 130 people were killed in 239 incidents of mob violence, while 61 inmates reportedly died in prison custody, ""many under questionable circumstances"".The report further noted 22 attacks on minority communities, involving vandalism of temples, homes, and idols, and over 50 incidents of attacks and desecration at shrines of Sufi saints across the country.The HRSS also recorded 340 cases of journalist harassment, including two killings, 209 assaults, and multiple instances of intimidation and arrests under the Cyber Security Act 2023.Hasina, 78, left the country for India on August 5, 2024, when her government was ousted.

Poll Do you believe the international community is doing enough to protect civilians in Myanmar? Yes No





At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday, a spokesperson for the exiled National Unity Government told the BBC.Hundreds had gathered in Chaung U township in central Myanmar on Monday evening for the Thadingyut full moon festival when the military dropped bombs on the crowd, according to a member of the organizing committee.The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said the gathering included both the festival and an anti-junta demonstration.""The committee alerted people and one-third of the crowd managed to flee,"" the woman was quoted as saying by AFP. ""But immediately, one motor-powered paraglider flew right over the crowd"", dropping two bombs on the centre of the gathering.""Children were completely torn apart,"" she added.She said that once another motorized paraglider flying overhead had left the area, people rushed in to assist the wounded.Locals said that the damage from Monday’s bombings made it difficult to identify the victims.""As of this morning, we were still collecting body parts from the ground -- pieces of flesh, limbs, parts of bodies that were blown apart,"" the woman added.The junta has increasingly turned to paramotors due to a shortage of aircraft and helicopters, a situation compounded by international sanctions that have made it harder for the regime to acquire military equipment, as cited by the BBC.In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International described the junta's use of motorized paragliders to target communities as part of a “disturbing trend” in the region.Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack “should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection.”Myanmar has been engulfed in civil conflict since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, prompting pro-democracy forces to take up arms and align with ethnic armed groups against the junta.At the candlelight vigil, participants protested military conscription and the upcoming elections while calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.The country is scheduled to hold general elections in December, the first since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, argue that the vote will not be free or fair, and is likely to enable the junta to maintain unchecked control.","At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday.

From fields to fame: Majestic water buffaloes crowned in Chonburi; crowds applaud Thailand’s unique beauty contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-fields-to-fame-majestic-water-buffaloes-crowned-in-chonburi-crowds-applaud-thailands-unique-beauty-contest/articleshow/124364600.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.

'Not ours': Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar distances from Donald Trump’s Gaza plan; claims ‘changes made to our draft’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/not-ours-pakistan-fm-ishaq-dar-distances-from-trumps-gaza-plan-claims-changes-made-to-our-draft/articleshow/124292502.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (left), Ishaq Dar (AP)

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

Indian-origin surgeon struck off UK medical register for antisemitic comments on Facebook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indian-origin-surgeon-struck-off-uk-medical-register-for-antisemitic-comments-on-facebook/articleshow/124434782.cms,"Representative image





LONDON: An Indian-origin surgeon who worked in the NHS for 25 years has been struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media, including calling a Jewish man “circumcised vermin” and a “Jewish rodent”.Manoj Sen, who qualified as a doctor in 1983 with an MBBS from the Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, (Calcutta Medical College), and moved to the UK in 1985, wrote on Facebook in response to Mr A, on October 10 2023, three days after the Nova festival massacre: “When dealing with circumcised vermin like you, not even the strongest measures will help,” adding that he was “regretful enough rats were not liquidated at Auschwitz”.In the same rant, Sen called Mr A a “Jewish c**t” and “Jewboy” and also wrote “Die Juden sind unsere Ungluck (The Jews are our misfortune)”. “Good thing he is no longer in a respectful place like India. He belongs in the flames of a crematorium,” he said of Mr A. At the time Sen was working as a surgeon at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow.Mr A raised a complaint about Sen with the General Medical Council (GMC) and the police.Sen was arrested and issued a police caution.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service concluded that Sen’s conduct amounted to serious misconduct and that immediate suspension and erasure from the medical register were the only appropriate sanction.The tribunal found his comments were antisemitic and seriously offensive, especially his reference to Auschwitz and a crematorium, which, the tribunal said, “went far beyond any acceptable or lawful expression of opinion”.“The language used suggested a deep hostility towards Jews as a group, rather than merely a personal attack on the complainant,” the tribunal said.The tribunal noted there was no written apology and “the degree of hostility expressed in his comments is fundamentally incompatible with the duty of a doctor to treat patients equally”, and that he had brought the medical profession into disrepute.On August 13 Sen told the GMC he did not wish to participate in the hearing and said “to go ahead and good luck.”In an email from Sen to the GMC in Feb 2024, he wrote: “In the heat of the moment I made wrongful and injudicious remarks — for which I have apologised in public on Facebook as well as privately to the police. Those remarks are entirely out of character.”",Indian-origin surgeon struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media.

Two Indian-origin brothers from east London have been sentenced after a mobile phone sent for repair uncovered disturbing videos of child sex abuse, leading to their conviction for multiple offences, reported BBC.Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday, following his guilty plea to 17 charges including rape and assault of a child under 13, possession of indecent images, and voyeurism. His crimes also extended to sexual offences against a woman over 16.His brother, Kishnan Patel, also from Plaistow, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment in June after pleading guilty to four counts related to making and possessing indecent images of children.The metropolitan police revealed that the investigation began when videos of child abuse were found on a mobile device belonging to Kishnan Patel, which had been submitted for repairs. Subsequent detective work identified Vruj Patel as the perpetrator in the footage, confirmed by visible features such as clothing and jewellery.Detective sergeant Rob Blant described Vruj Patel as a “cowardly, opportunistic offender who has preyed on vulnerable victims for his own sexual gratification,” as quoted by BBC.He added, “There are teams of dedicated, professional officers working across London who will leave no stone unturned to identify those who seek to commit offences against vulnerable people and bring offenders to justice.”Authorities believe some offences occurred as early as 2018, with voyeurism offences potentially continuing until recently. Police are appealing for any additional victims to come forward, expressing concern that there may be more children affected, possibly in the brothers’ home.Vruj Patel has been placed on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely, while Kishnan Patel will be subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.Throughout the investigation and trial, the victim-survivors received specialist support from law enforcement agencies, the met police confirmed.","Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court.
