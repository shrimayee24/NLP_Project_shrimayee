ops in Dubai, US

NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2022, a drug lord named Sunil Yadav landed in Delhi. He had cops and gangsters from Punjab chasing him. The crime syndicate wanted him as he was accused of snitching on Ankit Bhadu, an aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Bhadu was killed by Punjab police in 2019. In Delhi, Yadav aka Goli was able to get a passport issued in the name of 'Rahul' and fly to Dubai, from where he embarked on a perilous ""Donkey route"" journey to the US, reports .Two days ago, Yadav was gunned down by assailants who barged into his house in Stockton, California. Early Tuesday, the Bishnoi group claimed responsibility - with US-based gangster Goldy Brar and Rohit Godara announcing it on social media - ending a five-year-long pursuit.The Facebook post read: ""To all brothers, I, Rohit Godara, and Goldy Brar, take full responsibility for the murder of Sunil Yadav, alias Goli, in California. He had colluded with Punjab police to orchestrate the encounter of our beloved brother, Ankit Bhadu. We have avenged his death.""The post also mentioned the house number (6,706) where Yadav was killed. The post further alleged that Sunil Yadav was involved in drug trade, supplying narcotics in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, and had ties with the police. It also claimed that he had fled to the US after his role in Ankit Bhadu's encounter was exposed.The post concluded with a warning: ""To all our enemies, be prepared. We will reach you, no matter where you are in the world."" Investigators confirmed that Yadav's involvement in international-level drug trafficking operations spanned across Dubai and the US.""He was from Abohar, in Punjab's Fazilka district. He had managed to evade authorities by fleeing to the US two years ago using a fake passport,"" said a senior police officer.Interestingly, another associate, Rohit Godara, had also obtained a fake passport around the same time in the name of Pawan. The Rajasthan Police had issued a red corner notice against Yadav, soon after and a few of his associates were arrested in Dubai through local agencies.After Yadav's killing, the Stockton police said in a statement: ""Homicide (0349) at 6700 block of Mount Elbrus Way, Bear Creek District... Officers responded to the area of the call location on a report of a person shot. On arrival, officers located an adult male suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was declared deceased, and detectives responded.""Ankit Bhadu, whose death had been haunting the Bishnoi group, was a prominent name in Punjab's underworld. Following Bishnoi's arrest, Bhadu seized control of the gang's operations. Both Bishnoi and Ankit, along with Yadav, came from the same place - Fazilka in Punjab. Ankit was born into an agricultural family and had abandoned his education midway. In the aftermath of Lawrence's incarceration, Bhadu's notoriety soared in Punjab and Rajasthan, with his name becoming synonymous with numerous cases of extortion, murder and coercion. Prominent businessmen lived in fear of his ransom demands and life threats.Bhadu's criminal tentacles extended far beyond Punjab and Rajasthan, with police in Haryana, Delhi, UP and Himachal Pradesh also seeking his capture. The Rajasthan and Haryana police had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh each for information leading to his arrest, while Punjab police had offered a more substantial reward of Rs 2 lakh.In Aug 2018, Bhadu had a narrow escape from a police cordon laid by cops from Sriganganagar and Haryana. In the spring of 2019, the Punjab police's special intelligence cell finally tracked down and killed Bhadu, aged 23, in an encounter near Zirakpur. Interestingly, police had nabbed his girlfriend from Delhi airport a few days before the encounter. She had come back from Canada to meet him.","Sunil Yadav aka Goli was gunned down by assailants who barged into his house in Stockton, California.

Another potential route involved taking the Raimangal River to Hemnagar in Hingalganj, or reaching Khulna via Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas district,” a senior STF officer said, as quoted by PTI.Munshi was arrested by the West Bengal Special Task Force (STF) in a joint operation with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. The arrest took place near Canning in South 24 Parganas district, approximately 60 km from Kolkata, late Saturday night.The suspect was acting under the instructions of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group, according to the STF. The 58-year-old, described as an IED expert with extensive training in Pakistan, had been residing in the area disguised as a shawl seller for two days before he was arrested.“This individual appears to have been deeply involved in jihadist activities and was likely attempting to recruit people in the area,” the officer added. The STF is currently analyzing the call records from the mobile phones to identify potential collaborators and uncover more details about Munshi’s plans and movements.According to officials, Munshi’s notes, which are now being decoded, could provide valuable insights into his network and future plans.“Bangladesh was a strategic choice for Munshi as it could serve as a transit point to Pakistan. His journey from Kashmir to Bengal was part of a carefully calculated escape strategy,” the officer elaborated.Investigators disclosed that Munshi was the second-in-command of the TuM and had ties to other terror outfits operating in the Kashmir Valley, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Seized during the arrest were an Aadhaar card listing a Srinagar address, Rs 50,000 in cash, and two mobile phones.

K Annamalai: ‘If he believes he’s a bigger star…’: Annamalai slams Telangana CM Revanth Reddy over Allu Arjun case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-he-believes-hes-a-bigger-star-annamalai-slams-telangana-cm-revanth-reddy-over-allu-arjun-case/articleshow/116631007.cms,"File photo: BJP Tamil Nadu President K Annamalai (Picture credit: X/@annamalai_k)

NEW DELHI: BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai launched a scathing attack on Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy for police action against Telugu actor Allu Arjun in the stampede incident and said that it is a clear case of victimisation and bullying, orchestrated by Telangana CM.He criticised the CM’s handling of the situation, accusing him of leveraging state powers for personal and political vendettas. He also claimed that the vandalisation at the actor's residence was done by people from the CM's constituency.Addressing reporters, Annamalai said that Reddy was attempting to outshine Telugu superstar Allu Arjun.“I saw Mr Revanth Reddy’s interview, and it feels like he’s trying to compete with Allu Arjun for the title of superstar. If he believes he’s a bigger star, he should make a movie and see if he can pull crowds like Allu Arjun,” Annamalai remarked.The Tamil Nadu BJP leader also rebuked the Telangana government’s handling of the case, alleging bias and political motivations . “The way chief minister Revanth Reddy has spoken about Allu Arjun reeks of hatred rather than neutrality. Instead of focusing on governance, it appears that he is engaging in a competition to outshine the superstar,” he said.Annamalai questioned the treatment being given to the actor and said that the stampede during 'Pushpa 2' screening was an accident which was not intentionally planned by the actor. “Did Allu Arjun have the intention or motive for someone to lose their life? The incident was an accident, and he has shown remorse, but this relentless targeting is unwarranted,” he added.The comments come as Allu Arjun faces legal scrutiny over the December 4 stampede at Sandhya Theatre in Hyderabad, where a woman named Revathi lost her life and her son was critically injured. Despite claims of cooperation with the investigation, the actor has been accused of negligence and violating public safety norms by organizing a roadshow without official permission.Annamalai suggested that the Congress’s actions, including protests at Allu Arjun’s residence, were politically motivated. “The people throwing stones and creating chaos are politically aligned. It’s clear that Congress is using this incident as a stage to settle scores with someone who has refused to toe their line,” he stated.“State powers are meant to serve the people, not to play politics. This entire episode shows Congress’s inability to focus on governance,” Annamalai added.Annamalai emphasised the need for impartiality and adherence to the rule of law. “Cinema stars, despite their fame, must be treated equally under the law. However, this case reflects a clear misuse of power for political gains. Bullying and victimising an individual, especially someone who has expressed regret and cooperated fully, serve no justice,” he stated.Earlier, BJP leaders such as Pradeep Bhandari and Shehzad Poonawalla alleged that Congress orchestrated the vandalism at Allu Arjun’s Jubilee Hills residence. “This is vendetta politics . The Congress, unable to tolerate a neutral voice like Arjun’s, is resorting to state-sponsored attacks,” Poonawalla said, pointing to the involvement of individuals linked to the Kodangal Youth Congress in the protests.Bhandari alleged that the protestors were close associates of CM Revanth Reddy, accusing the Congress of “vendetta politics.”While Telangana CM Revanth Reddy has held the actor responsible for the tragedy, alleging violations of public safety, BJP leaders have rallied around Arjun, accusing Congress of authoritarian tactics.","BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai launched a scathing attack on Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy for police action against Telugu actor Allu Arjun in the stampede incident.

And whatever they decide will be accepted by Sangh and VHP,"" Saraswati said. He said despite Bhagwat's similar comments in the past, temple structures have been identified at 56 new sites, underscoring ongoing interest in these disputes. He said religious organisations often act in response to public sentiment than political agendas.Also read: Wrong understanding of dharma leads to atrocities in its name across the world, says Bhagwat This marks the first time Bhagwat has faced major dissent from within the saffron ecosystem. Religious gurus like Jagadguru Rambhadracharya believe that Sangh should defer to spiritual figures in decisions related to religion. Analysts suggested the seer's backlash reflects a larger struggle within the Hindu religious community over RSS's influence in matters of faith. Bhagwat's remarks came after Hindu groups filed legal petitions seeking the demolition of mosques they claim were built on temple sites, including Shahi Jama Masjid in UP's Sambhal. In response, Bhagwat warned that 'no one will become a leader of Hindus by raking up temple-mosque disputes and spreading communal divide'.Rambhadracharya challenged the RSS chief's authority, saying: ""Let me make it clear, Mohan Bhagwat is not our disciplinarian, but we are."" He said the recent unrest in Sambhal, where a temple-mosque dispute led to violence and five deaths, highlight the importance of judicial and democratic processes in resolving such issues.""The positive side is that things are being uncovered in favour of Hindus.

The death toll is expected to climb as rescue efforts continue, according to reports by Khaama Press.The strikes hit seven villages, including Laman, where five members of a single family lost their lives.According to reports, Pakistani jets were responsible for the bombings, with Murg Bazaar village bearing significant destruction.The Taliban’s ministry of defence condemned the airstrikes and vowed retaliation. “Defending our land and sovereignty is our legitimate right,” the ministry stated, adding that ""Waziristani refugees"" were among the victims.Official casualty figures have not yet been disclosed, but at least 15 bodies have reportedly been recovered.The airstrikes occur against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly over the presence of militants from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghan territory. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces. These attacks have killed and injured dozens of soldiers in recent months, heightening security concerns in Islamabad.","Pakistan launched a series of airstrikes targeting Afghanistan’s Barmal district on December 24.

Preston Cook’s discovery sparks legislation

Legislation passes through Congress

US President Joe Biden on Tuesday officially declared the bald eagle the national bird of the United States . The legislation, passed by Congress and signed by the President, amends the US Code to formally recognize the bald eagle's status. The bald eagle, recognizable by its white head, yellow beak, and brown body, has been a symbol of the nation for over 240 years.This designation grants the bald eagle the same official status as the national mammal ( American bison ), national flower (rose), and national tree (oak).In 1782, the bald eagle became a central part of the Great Seal of the United States , used on official documents. The seal includes the eagle, an olive branch, arrows, a shield, the motto ""E Pluribus Unum,"" and a constellation of stars. Congress designated the bald eagle as the national emblem that same year. Its image appears on various official items, including the presidential flag, military insignia, US currency, and government documents, according to USA.gov. However, until now, it lacked the official designation as the national bird. The bald eagle is native to North America.Preston Cook, a collector of eagle memorabilia, discovered the lack of official designation while writing a book. ""It makes me feel like I’m levitating,"" Cook said, as quoted by The Jamestown Sun. ""I am thrilled this bill has passed the Senate and now the House to honor, after 240 years, our living symbol, the bald eagle. This bill gives the bald eagle the recognition it fully deserves.""The House passed the bill on December 16 to make the designation official by voice vote. The Senate unanimously approved the bill in July. The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Representative Brad Finstad (R-Minn.).""More than 240 years ago, the Founding Fathers identified the bald eagle as a symbol of the strength and independence promised in our new nation,"" Finstad said, as quoted by The Jamestown Sun. ""Since then, we have revered this majestic creature as the unquestionable icon of the United States. Today, we rightfully recognize the bald eagle as our official national bird — bestowing an honor that is long overdue.”Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, said, ""There is nothing more American than a bald eagle soaring across the Wyoming sky. These majestic creatures have long been viewed as the official bird of this country and it is past time we made it official without costing taxpayers a single cent.”Minnesota, Finstad and Klobuchar’s home state, boasts a large bald eagle population","President Joe Biden officially declared the bald eagle the national bird of the United States. The bald eagle, recognizable by its white head, yellow beak, and brown body, has been a symbol of the nation for over 240 years. The legislation, passed by Congress and signed by the President, amends the US Code to formally recognize the eagle's status.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116645374,imgsize-860509,width-400,resizemode-4/116645374.jpg"

Who is Valentina Gomez

The

execution video

and its aftermath

A history of controversial stances

The broader impact

Valentina Gomez , a Colombian-born American real estate investor and political activist, has ignited national outrage following the release of a graphic video depicting the simulated execution of a migrant. Known for her provocative statements and far-right rhetoric , Gomez’s latest stunt has drawn widespread condemnation and raised questions about the impact of extremist messaging in American politics.Her video comes after an illegal migrant was charged with the murder and arson after setting an unknown woman on fire while on the New York City subway.Born on May 8, 1999, in Medellín, Colombia, Gomez immigrated to the US with her family in 2009, settling in Jersey City, New Jersey. She first gained attention as a real estate investor, but it was her entrance into politics that made her a polarizing figure, reported the Daily Mail.In 2024, she ran for Missouri Secretary of State, where she made headlines for her controversial stances. Her campaign included inflammatory videos, such as one where she declared, ""Don't be weak and gay,"" while running through an LGBTQ+ neighborhood in St. Louis, and another where she burned LGBTQ+ books, calling them “grooming, indoctrinating, and sexualizing.” She finished sixth out of eight candidates in the Republican primary, securing only 7.4% of the vote.Despite this setback, Gomez has continued to push her controversial views, often through social media, where she has been banned multiple times for violating platform guidelines. Her videos, which often tackle culture war issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and gun control, have made her a significant figure in far-right circles.In her most recent viral video, Gomez posted footage of herself shooting a hooded dummy, tied to a chair, in the back of the head with a handgun. “Public executions for any illegal that rapes or kills an American. They don’t deserve deportation, they deserve to be ended,” she says in the video. The clip was quickly censored by X (formerly Twitter) due to its violent content but continued to spread widely across social media.While many decried the video as promoting violence and extremism, some of Gomez’s followers praised her, echoing her sentiments about tough justice for undocumented immigrants. “What is wrong with these people?” one commenter wrote, while others supported her call for harsher measures.After the video was restricted, Gomez took to her platform to defend her actions, saying, “My video being restricted & my account getting suspended shows all of you that I am the biggest threat to the establishment. I don’t need their money. Stay strapped.” She also added that similar treatment should apply to pedophiles, criticizing Congress for its perceived inaction on important issues, reported the Daily Mail.This is not the first time Gomez has courted controversy. In February, she filmed herself burning LGBTQ+ books, vowing to ban similar literature if elected. She has also made headlines for her inflammatory remarks against transgender people, including a public attack on transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and her stance on the 2020 election, which she believes was stolen from Donald Trump.Gomez’s social media presence, marked by unapologetic declarations such as “Jesus is King. MAGA . America First,” has earned her both fervent supporters and staunch critics.In addition to her provocative social media antics, Gomez’s political ambitions are far from over. She recently announced plans to run for Congress in Texas, though she has yet to specify which incumbent Republican she will challenge.Gomez’s rise has sparked broader discussions about the role of social media in amplifying extremist views and the consequences of political figures using inflammatory rhetoric to gain attention. While her supporters argue she speaks truth to power, many fear her brand of politics is dangerously divisive, further polarizing the nation.Her actions have even had repercussions within her family. Her brother, Jonathan Gomez, was fired from his position as an aide to Jersey City’s mayor after it was revealed he had made donations to her campaign.","Valentina Gomez, a Colombian-born American real estate investor and political activist, has ignited national outrage following the release of a graphic video depicting the simulated execution of a migrant.

Lindy Li , a major Democratic National Committee fundraiser, has left the Democratic Party , citing internal issues and backlash over her criticisms of US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris . Following her departure, Li accused the party of wasting their ""hard-earned money"" and billions during the presidential campaign.

""On Saturday, I went on Fox & Friends and said, 'Democrats have a stench of loser hanging over them.'

A Resignation Amid Scandal



A scathing report from the House Ethics Committee has laid bare shocking allegations against former Representative Matt Gaetz. The findings, published on December 23, 2024, reveal a pattern of alleged misconduct involving sexual activity, drug use, and abuse of power spanning several years. The report is based on testimony, financial records, and communications gathered during the investigation, which concluded despite Gaetz's resignation from Congress .The report alleges Gaetz paid women for sex from 2017 to 2020, including a 17-year-old girl in 2017. These payments were often made through apps like Venmo, with innocuous descriptions masking their purpose.Payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars were flagged as likely connected to sexual activities, with some witnesses describing the transactions as routine arrangements.The report details that Gaetz frequently used illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, during his interactions with women. Witnesses described instances where drugs were either brought by participants or supplied at Gaetz's request.Drugs were also reportedly present during a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, where Gaetz and others engaged in similar behavior.Gaetz allegedly abused his congressional position to provide favors for individuals with whom he had personal relationships. This includes aiding a woman in obtaining a passport under false pretenses.This act raises concerns about the misuse of official resources for personal benefit.The Committee found Gaetz deliberately obstructed its investigation, refusing to provide testimony, ignoring subpoenas, and publicly mischaracterizing the inquiry.Gaetz’s lack of cooperation and his public defiance delayed the investigation and complicated efforts to gather critical evidence.The report concludes Gaetz violated House rules, federal and state laws, and ethical standards, bringing significant discredit to Congress.While the Committee did not find sufficient evidence to pursue federal sex trafficking charges, the breadth of the allegations has cast a shadow over his legacy.Gaetz resigned from Congress on November 14, 2024, amid speculation over a potential appointment as Attorney General in the incoming administration. However, his withdrawal from consideration for the role following the report has left his political future in doubt.","The House Ethics Committee published a scathing report on December 23, 2024.

The tragic scene

The 'Daniel Penny Factor'

The NYPD’s inaction

A question of accountability

Zapeta-Calil’s arrest

A broader conversation on public safety

In a horrifying incident that has left New Yorkers grappling with questions of responsibility and inaction, a woman was set on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train—and no one stepped in to help. As the flames engulfed her body, shocking footage reveals a group of onlookers, including police officers, who either watched or walked past without offering aid. The incident, which unfolded on Sunday morning, December 22, at Stillwell Avenue station, has sparked outrage across the city, with many wondering: why didn’t anyone intervene?The woman, believed to be homeless, was reportedly asleep when Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , 33, an illegal Guatemalan immigrant who had sneaked back into the country after being deported, allegedly set her on fire. In a chilling video shared online, at least three bystanders can be seen looking on as the victim’s clothing is consumed by flames. One individual even filmed the horrific scene rather than offering help.Amid the chaos, a New York Police Department (NYPD) officer, stationed outside the subway car, seemingly did nothing as the fire spread. The flames eventually consumed the victim, who tragically died at the scene. In the video, another officer walks past the burning woman, raising his hands as if unsure of how to respond. Only Zapeta-Calil, the alleged perpetrator, is seen moving closer, fanning the flames with his shirt before being subdued by police hours later.The incident quickly gained national attention, with many speculating that the bystanders’ reluctance to intervene could be attributed to the ongoing public debate surrounding civilian involvement in dangerous situations. Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels and a longtime community activist, pointed to the high-profile case of Daniel Penny, the ex-Marine who was acquitted after choking Jordan Neely, a homeless man, to death on a subway train earlier this year. Sliwa argued that Penny’s legal ordeal, in which he faced charges for his actions, may have deterred others from stepping in to help during moments of crisis.“Nobody came to her aid,” Sliwa said. “People are frozen now. They think, ‘I don’t want to get jammed up like Penny.’” He believes the fear of legal repercussions is dissuading potential Good Samaritans from acting in emergencies.While the public’s response was one of shock and anger, so too was the reaction to the NYPD’s response. In a scathing critique, former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik condemned the officers for their apparent indifference. “No one even attempted to help this woman. They watched like cowards,” Kerik said, echoing the sentiments of many who saw the officers passively observing the horror unfold.Pat Calvin, a former EMT, expressed his outrage, stating that both he and his father—who had worked for the NYPD—were appalled by the officers’ lack of action. “If I were there, I would have run to help her,” Calvin said. “The police were right there, and they did nothing.”New York residents and activists took to social media to voice their frustration. One user wrote, “The NYPD will shoot you down for jumping the turnstile, but they’ll walk past a woman on fire? Shameful.” Another criticized the officers for failing to intervene and lamented the lack of community responsibility, saying, “I hate that we have no sense of responsibility towards each other.”In the aftermath, questions abound: why did no one step in? Was it fear of legal consequences, or a growing apathy towards others’ suffering? Some critics pointed to a system that seems to foster hesitation in the face of crime or violence, citing the ‘revolving door justice’ that has become a concern for many New Yorkers. “There are a lot of people in the city who are afraid to act because they feel unsupported by the city’s elected officials,” said Gerard Kassar, chairman of the Conservative Party.Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed the officers’ response, saying they were unaware that Zapeta-Calil, who was later arrested, was involved in the crime. Chief of Transit Joe Gulotta clarified that the officers were attempting to find a fire extinguisher while the tragedy unfolded. However, many critics argue that there was a greater failure at play—the failure to act when a life was in immediate danger.Zapeta-Calil was arrested hours after the attack, when a group of high school students on another train recognized him and alerted authorities. He was detained at Herald Square after officers tracked him down, wearing the same distinctive clothes he was seen in during the attack. The suspect has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and arson.Despite his claims that he was drunk and does not remember setting the woman on fire, Zapeta-Calil’s actions have been described as “depraved” by the NYPD. Police investigators believe the victim and the suspect did not know each other, raising the possibility of an unprovoked attack.This tragedy has sparked a broader conversation on public safety, legal responsibility, and the moral obligation to intervene in dangerous situations. Governor Kathy Hochul, who had previously made public statements praising the safety of the subway system, was swiftly criticized for her tone-deafness, as the news of the woman’s death broke shortly after she posted photos touting the safety improvements in the subway system.While Hochul has pledged to increase police presence and resources in the subway system, the public’s trust in the NYPD has been shaken. As one social media user put it, “Where are the Daniel Pennys when you need them?”","A woman was set on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train, and no one stepped in to help.

US Air Force on Tuesday said the Santa Claus need not be concerned about recent mystery drone sighting over New Jersey as an annual tradition of ""tracking"" Saint Nick is in action.The US Air Force's reassurances came as the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) reported that Santa and his reindeer were making stops in Russia and Iran after visiting countries further east including Japan, North Korea and Indonesia.According to the Norad Santa tracker , Santa is in Canada. Santa's journey this year comes after weeks of mysterious sightings of alleged drones in the US state of New Jersey, sparking worldwide curiosity even as many of the reported incidents were debunked.""Of course we are concerned about drones and anything else in the air,"" Norad commander Guillot told Fox News. ""But I don't foresee any difficulty at all with drones for Santa this year.""Norad’s Santa tracker originated in 1955 when a Colorado newspaper accidentally printed a hotline number for children to call Santa, which instead connected them to Norad's military operations center. Colonel Harry Shoup, then the director of operations, answered one such call and immediately recognized the mix-up.""But (he) didn't want to upset him. So he started talking to the young child and passed along information"" on Santa's location, Canadian Air Force Major-General William Radiff, Norad's current director of operations was quoted as telling news agency AFP.""And then afterwards, he talked to the rest of the staff there and said, 'please, we're going to get phone calls today... Let's start doing this.'""The Norad Santa tracker has gained worldwide popularity. Last year, the modernized website noradsanta.org, featuring a 3D map of Santa's real-time movements and a live count of delivered presents, received 20.6 million visits. Additionally, over 400,000 calls were made to the tracker’s toll-free hotline, according to Canadian Air Force Major-General William Radiff.“We receive calls from around the globe, with people eager to know Santa’s location,” Radiff was quoted as saying.Beyond its festive role, Norad is tasked with critical aerospace and maritime defense operations, including monitoring missile activity from North Korea—something Santa may have considered as he navigated over Pyongyang.In the holiday spirit, Norad uses its infrared-capable satellites to track Santa, with Rudolph’s glowing nose serving as a key indicator. “Rudolph’s nose emits a unique signature that helps us monitor Santa's journey across the world,” Radiff explained.Astronaut Buzz Aldrin commended Norad’s efforts on social media, praising their precise tracking of Santa's flight path. Continuing a cherished tradition, President Joe Biden joined Norad’s festivities this year by taking calls from children, as he did last Christmas.",US Air Force says Santa Claus need not be concerned about recent mystery drone sighting over New Jersey.

How so many people became obsessed with looking for drones in the sky,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-so-many-people-became-obsessed-with-looking-for-drones-in-the-sky/articleshow/116645480.cms,"File: A family that reported seeing multiple drones walks along the beach in Seaside Heights, N.J., Dec. 13, 2024. Many reported sightings are from people seeing the official drones up looking for supposed ""mystery"" drones.

'Out in the Ocean'

Airplanes and Stars

It was a dry and cool Wednesday evening outside the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey , a longtime military installation that once made the bombs and shells that led to victory in World War II. A contractor there knocked off work and decided to wait out rush-hour traffic. He picked up some takeout from Wawa , parked outside a nearby wildlife preserve and settled in to watch an episode of Joe Rogan's podcast on his phone. Then he saw a flash in the side mirror.A light rising straight up from the tree line and toward the arsenal. He started recording. Could it have been a plane?Or was it a drone?And so began what seems to be the origin story of the ongoing drone saga. The contractor called in his sighting to his superiors Nov. 13, and others followed quickly, first throughout the county, then the rest of New Jersey, then into neighboring states.Countless people have reported mysterious hovering objects dotting the night skies and posted blurred images -- a white light, a black background -- on social media. Every day, for weeks. Drones. Drones?Small drones. Drones big as vans. Blinking, stationary, speeding and zipping and buzzing.Jeffrey Parker first saw them outside his Vineland, New Jersey, apartment building. He was barefoot, checking the mail, and there they were: three lights flying low and slow.""I was like damn, that's not airplanes,"" said Parker, 65.Was it a foreign government? Our own government? Kids? Visitors from space?The story grew to consume police departments, sheriffs, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, a former reality TV star with a supposed inside line to NASA, mayors, governors, the White House and the president-elect.But now it appears increasingly likely that if there were any drones at all, it was very few, and that most of the drones people did see -- stay with this -- were up there looking for the drones people thought they were seeing.Mounting evidence, and lack thereof, suggests that perhaps the whole craze has been a sort of communal fever dream fueled by crowd mentality, confirmation bias and a general distrust in all things official.This explanation has been widely rejected by those sharing their personal drone experiences, leaving them feeling belittled and gaslit and creating the kind of hothouse where conspiracy theories take root, grow and thrive.Five days after the arsenal sighting, on Nov. 18, multiple drones were reported, there and elsewhere in surrounding Morris County. A Facebook page called Live Storm Chasers with 1.3 million followers posted a five-drone sighting.The Morris County Prosecutors Office issued a statement from sheriffs, police chiefs and emergency officials that simultaneously acknowledged and downplayed the sightings and urged people to ""be mindful that what they read online may not be accurate.""Still, a day later, the FBI quietly opened its own investigation into the drones. The agency would later announce a drone hotline and receive about 5,000 tips.And the Federal Aviation Administration posted temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over the arsenal and, shortly after, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.The owner of that club would weigh in soon enough.November turned to December, and without any new, proved evidence or data to frame what was happening, the story exploded. A lack of facts became pure oxygen on social media and, on its heels, mainstream media. Even people's Ring doorbells, equipped to alert users with messages from other Ring users, began to ping out drone sightings.Jessica Fiorentino , 33, a mother of two young children in Toms River, had heard about drones, but when she went to the beach one night, she couldn't believe what she saw.""All the way out in the ocean, drones,"" she said Friday in an interview. ""Some would stay above the ocean, and some would come onto the land."" She alerted her followers on TikTok , normally filled with mom posts, and kept going out, every night, sometimes to other beaches, always posting videos.""They are very low in Seaside Heights right now,"" she said in a video on a recent December night, pointing out two lights.""Part of me is starting to maybe think that red drone is someone's drone, like someone here, putting it up, like police,"" she reported. ""And the one above it is the unidentified drone."" The video was viewed more than 393,000 times.The federal government was widely seen as being slow to react and confusing in its messaging, which was essentially ""Don't panic, but be vigilant.""Then came Dec. 8 at Island Beach State Park, a narrow stripe of coastline in southern New Jersey. A State Park Police officer contacted the local Ocean County Sheriff's office with a frightening report right out of a summer blockbuster.""Fifty drones were coming from the ocean toward the mainland,"" Sheriff Michael Mastronardy told Fox News. He rushed to the beach and met the officer. ""She had legitimate information she provided,"" Mastronardy said in a recent interview.The next night, Mastronardy was joined by a Republican member of Congress, Rep. Chris Smith, who wanted a firsthand look.He said the drones ""have so far evaded identification, origin, mission or potential threat to Americans"" and criticized the Biden administration for not taking it seriously.Sen. Andy Kim , D-N.J., was frustrated by a lack of information, so he accompanied police officers Dec. 12 to three sites that had been flooded with drone calls.""They were kind of pointing out things that were flying,"" he said. ""Some, they were like, 'That's a drone.' These are police officers. They've been out there for weeks now.""He took videos and showed them to aviation experts, who convinced him that the objects were actually manned aircraft.""It kind of highlighted to me: This is the information that people need,"" he said.Other lawmakers have suggested that the drones should be shot out of the sky. Some people may have tried to heed that call, in a way. Plane and helicopter pilots reported dozens of incidents of lasers being pointed at them over New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in early December. Shining a laser at an aircraft can injure or blind the pilot, and is a federal crime. The FBI responded and urged people to stop.Fiorentino, her once-MomTok now a full-time DroneTok, was still recording every night, and growing more alarmed at what she was seeing.""There's stuff spraying out of them -- this is new to me,"" she said in a video Dec. 15. That video was viewed 485,000 times, and another she posted about spraying got 2.8 million views.Jennifer McDonald, 48, taking her 15-minute break outside a Walmart in Pennsville, still hadn't seen a drone well into December. Her husband kept asking her. Then she went outside and looked up.""Hot damn,"" she said. She called her husband on FaceTime and they spent her whole break watching the little lights in the sky together.By mid-December, after weeks of shrugs, the federal government stepped up its attempt to explain what was going on. In short, officials said: They're not drones.An FBI representative told reporters that of the 5,000 hotline tips it received, fewer than 100 leads had been generated and deemed worthy of further investigation.Four federal agencies quickly echoed that analysis, saying the bright lights floating or flying in the night sky above New Jersey were airplanes, helicopters, stars or drones that were not suspicious.The messaging did not appear to resonate among the people looking up. Kim, shopping with his two sons at a Lego Store in the Cherry Hill Mall recently, was approached with one question.""What is happening with the drones?""Bethenny Frankel, formerly of ""The Real Housewives of New York City,"" became another regular drone reporter on TikTok.""I know this guy whose father worked with the Pentagon and NASA and secret projects, and he has been messaging me that he will never forgive himself if he doesn't tell the people he knows,"" she began in a post last week. ""These drones are ours and quite possibly could be sniffing out something dangerous.""The next morning, the ""Good Day New York"" program on Fox reported her claim, ""and that it has something to do with radioactive material in New Jersey,"" Rosanna Scotto, the host, said on air.At a news conference Dec. 16, the same day the federal agencies said most reported drone sightings were not drones, President-elect Donald Trump was asked about the situation, and he chuckled.""The government knows what is happening,"" he said. ""For some reason, they don't want to comment."" He seemed to allude to the airspace restrictions over his club in Bedminster, where he said he had planned to go the next weekend.""I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster,"" he said. ""I decided to cancel my trip.""By the end of the week, looking to literally clear the air, the FAA announced a ban on drone use in airspace above critical infrastructure in more than 90 communities in New Jersey and New York.And Kim said Friday that federal drone detecting devices that had been put in place in hot spots in recent weeks had not detected any drones.This will probably do little to calm a jittery public.In Toms River, Fiorentino said she'll keep posting TikTok videos. ""We have no answers,"" she said. ""They're still here. I hear more counties are getting them. More states are getting them.""And, if she's being honest, it's a nice diversion after a long day of work and kids. ""People are relying on me to go out there,"" she said. ""For me it was like, OK, I can take a break from the chaos inside.""At Picatinny Arsenal, where it all began weeks ago, the contractor who reported what he saw in his car's mirror has otherwise stayed quiet about the incident, telling just a few colleagues and an old college classmate. He is speaking out now on the condition that his name be withheld because he is not authorized to address the matter. As he has watched the drone frenzy spread across the country, he said he can't help but worry he's to blame.""I feel,"" he said, ""like I've caused mass hysteria.""","Many reported sightings are from people seeing the official drones up looking for supposed ""mystery"" drones. The story grew to consume police departments, sheriffs, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Mounting evidence suggests that perhaps the whole craze has been a communal fever dream.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646433,imgsize-23932,width-400,resizemode-4/116646433.jpg"
Subway murder suspect Sebastian Zapeta's drunken rant goes viral: 'I don’t give a s**t about people',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/subway-murder-suspect-sebastian-zapetas-drunken-rant-goes-viral-i-dont-give-a-st-about-people/articleshow/116644718.cms,"Subway murder suspect Sebastian Zapeta’s drunken rant goes viral in shocking video.

What do we know about the case?

The suspect

The victim

Details from a shelter roommate

The attack

The broader impact

A chilling new video has surfaced online, allegedly showing Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , the man accused of setting a woman on fire aboard a New York City subway, spewing a drunken rant about alcohol and locals.In the clip, the man can be heard talking about “drinking beer” and saying, “I don’t give a s**t about people.” While much of the footage is unintelligible, one user noted, “At the very beginning, he says ‘estas bien a verga loco,’ meaning he is very, very high.”The video, shared by a social media user who claimed it depicts Zapeta-Calil, comes in the aftermath of the horrific attack. Authorities have not yet confirmed the video’s authenticity, but the reaction online has been swift, with many users calling for harsh punishment. One commented, “He sat there and watched her. He’s a total sociopath.” Another added, “It’s unfortunate that New York does not have the death penalty.”Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, a Guatemalan immigrant who had previously been deported in 2018, was arraigned on murder and arson charges on Tuesday. Federal immigration officials confirmed he re-entered the US illegally, though the timeline remains unclear.Authorities allege Zapeta calmly approached the victim aboard a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station on Sunday morning. He set her clothing ablaze and fanned the flames with a shirt as she burned to death.Zapeta was arrested hours after police released surveillance images. Three high schoolers recognized him and alerted officers, who found him wearing the same paint-splattered pants and tan boots seen in the footage. During interrogation, Assistant District Attorney Ari Rottenberg said Zapeta identified himself in images of the attack but claimed he didn’t know what happened, admitting to regular alcohol consumption.The woman has not yet been identified. Authorities said she was seated at the end of the train car when the attack occurred. NYPD Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta stated that there was no prior interaction between the suspect and the victim.Sebastian Zapeta-Calil’s disturbing behavior reportedly escalated after using K2, a synthetic drug, and drinking heavily. “He smoked K2, drank, and bugged out,” said his shelter roommate Raymond Robinson, speaking to The New York Post. Robinson described Zapeta as erratic when high but otherwise coherent. “When he wasn’t high, he’d talk like we’re talking regular.”On the day of the attack, Robinson recalled Zapeta having a normal breakfast at the shelter and saying, “I am going out to make my normal run.” Hours later, police allege, he carried out the horrific act, leaving even his roommate stunned.The victim, yet to be identified, was sitting quietly on a stationary F train at the Coney Island station around 7:30 amon Sunday. Police say Zapeta approached her without a word, set her clothing on fire, and fanned the flames with a shirt. Video evidence reportedly shows him standing by as she burned to death.Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crime “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.” Online reactions echoed similar sentiments, with one user questioning, “When will the American people demand repercussions from those who funded and allowed the flood?”Violent subway incidents like this continue to draw national attention. Despite a 6% drop in overall subway crime this year compared to 2023, murders in the system have risen, with nine recorded so far in 2024 compared to five in the same period last year.New York Mayor Eric Adams acknowledged the impact of such incidents, saying, “When you have these incidents, it overshadows the success, and it plays on the psyche of New Yorkers.” He also pointed to the involvement of mental health issues in many high-profile crimes on the transit system.The next court hearing for Zapeta is scheduled for Friday as New Yorkers await further updates on the case.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, is accused of setting a woman on fire aboard a New York City subway.

Sebastian Zapeta Calil: NYC subway horror accused told mates he was going for run; then burnt sleeping woman on train,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyc-subway-horror-accused-told-mates-he-was-going-for-run-then-burnt-sleeping-woman-on-train/articleshow/116640534.cms,"Accused Sebastian Zapeta-Calil used to act crazy when intoxicated but never harmed anyone, his shelter home pals said.

Act of frenzy, no motive found, Zapeta says he has no memory



Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, the 33-year-old madman who set a sleeping woman on fire inside a train at NYC subway as others looked on, told his mates that he was going for his morning run. And the next thing his pals heard was that he was arrested for setting a woman on fire.Raymond Robinson, who slept next to the accused murderer, at a shelter house in East New York, said Zapeta started his Sunday with a breakfast of French toast, sausage and grits and went out, the New York Post reported.The illegal Guatemalan migrant was a heavy drinker who chain-smoked K2, his pals at the shelter house said. They confirmed that he used to act weird when he used to be high but he never harmed anybody being intoxicated.“He smoked K2, drank and bugged out,” Robinson said. “He would bug out and talk to himself when he was high, but he never harmed nobody or himself. When he wasn’t high he’d talk like we’re talking regular.”Sebastian Zapeta told the police that he had no memory of setting the woman on fire. However, surveillance footage showed that Zapeta walked toward the woman on an F train at the Coney Island station who was sitting motionless wrapped in her blanket -- probably sleeping and ignited her blanket and clothing. The woman did not react to it until the fire completely engulfed her and she was completely burned.Zapeta walked out of the station and saw the woman burning. An unverified video showed Zapeta before the alleged murder where he was giving a drunken ranting.Zapeta-Calil entered the US illegally sometime in the past six years after he was once deported in 2018. He has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree arson.“The depravity of this horrific crime is beyond comprehension, and my office is committed to bringing the perpetrator to justice. This gruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman will be met with the most serious consequences,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil was a heavy drinker who chain-smoked K2, his pals at the shelter house in East New York said.

Donald Trump's former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci issued a veiled threat to Elon Musk and warned him to stick to his business instead of wielding his political power in Washington as he will be hurt, Scaramucci said. Elon Musk dismissed the threat and instead asked whether Scaramucci could do the fandango like in that Queen song -- much to the amusement of his fans.“Listen, he’s got a very powerful role. He‘s got a $44 billion megaphone. He‘s got over 200 plus million followers and, Wolf, he was instrumental in that election.

You think you’re going to go to Washington and change Washington, that’s Potomac fever,"" Scaramucci said adding that one of the symptoms of Potomac fever is that who has it does not know that he has the Potomac fever. ""I have had Potomac fever. I am speaking as a former patient,"" he said.“He’s just got to be very very careful because he’s making enemies that he doesn’t realize, and the incentives in Washington are totally different from those in business,"" he said adding that his advice to Elon Musk would be to lay off the gas on politics.“And I think the power that he‘s wielding right now, Washington has a great immunological system, and I think they‘ll find a way to rebut him. So I would say to Elon Musk, not that he would listen to me, but stick to business. You‘ve done great. You‘ve made a couple hundred billion dollars since the election. Uh, lay off the gas on politics a little bit because these people could hurt you. And there's no need for you to get hurt. You‘re doing so well in your life,"" Scaramucci said.The comments came as Elon Musk was called 'President Musk' as he took the lead in getting the bipartisan spending bill rejected by Congress.

Former US President Bill Clinton, 78, was discharged from Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington on Tuesday following treatment for the flu, according to his deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena.""He and his family are deeply grateful for the exceptional care provided by the team at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and are touched by the kind messages and well wishes he received. He sends his warmest wishes for a happy and healthy holiday season to all,"" Ureña said in a statement.“President Clinton remains in good spirits and deeply appreciates the excellent care he received,” Urena added.Clinton had been admitted on Monday after experiencing a fever, Urena confirmed in a post on the social media platform X.Clinton was admitted for tests and observation after developing flu-like symptoms but was reportedly in stable condition throughout his stay. Urena stated that Clinton is expected to return home before Christmas, adding, “The president is fine.”This latest hospitalization is not Clinton's first health-related incident. Over the years, the former president has faced several health challenges, including a quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, placement of two coronary stents in 2010 and a six-day hospital stay in 2021 for anon-Covid-related urological infection that spread to his bloodstream.Clinton, who served as US president from 1993 to 2001, has adopted a predominantly vegan diet in recent years, resulting in significant weight loss and improved health.Despite his health challenges, Clinton has remained active in public life.Earlier this year, he spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid.","Former US President Bill Clinton, 78, discharged from Georgetown University Medical Center.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation. Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit.

Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions within the organisation. Among them were two pilots, a stewardess, and a data entry operator. Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered. Similarly, Mohsin Ali, a co-pilot since 2006, confessed to using a fake BA degree despite the job requiring only intermediate qualifications.Arif Tarar, who served 39 years with PIA, admitted to using a fake FA degree to move from peon to data entry operator. He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

This decision has heightened concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts may increasingly handle cases tied to the former leader.The US State Department expressed ""deep concern"" over the verdicts, stating, ""deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal for their involvement in protests on May 9, 2023.""Similarly, the British foreign office raised issues of fairness, saying, ""trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial.""The European Union echoed these concerns, noting the sentences were ""inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.""The protests erupted after Khan’s arrest by paramilitary forces, during which his supporters targeted military installations. The military court ruling came on Saturday, just days after Khan was indicted by an anti-terrorism court.Khan, who was briefly released after his May 2023 arrest, was detained again in August and has remained in jail since. He faces numerous legal cases after being ousted as prime minister in 2022. Following his removal, he launched a protest movement against the coalition government led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Khan has claimed the cases against him, which disqualify him from contesting the 2024 elections, are politically motivated.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H.

Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

Sixteen Pakistani soldiers were killed and five critically injured on Saturday after militants attacked an army post near the Afghan border.The attack happened overnight in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, roughly 40 kms (24 miles) from the border.More than 30 militants assaulted the post, according to two intelligence officials who spoke to AFP (anonymously). The attack lasted two hours. “The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint,” one official said. The militants then retreated.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, stating the attack was “in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders.”The militants reported getting hold of significant military equipment, including machine guns and night vision technology.Meanwhile, in connection to another attack on Pakistan military in May last year, 25 people have been sentenced to periods of two to 10 years of ""rigorous imprisonment"", the military's media wing announced on Saturday.
