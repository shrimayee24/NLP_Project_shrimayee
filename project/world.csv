WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI/MONTREAL: US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately issued notifications that fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.FAA's continued airworthiness notification on July 11 came after a preliminary report Friday into last month's Boeing 787-8 crash, which killed 260 people, raised questions over engine fuel cutoff switches. The notification to civil aviation authorities said: ""Although the fuel control switch design, including locking feature, is similar on various Boeing aeroplane models, the FAA does not consider this issue to be an unsafe condition that would warrant an airworthiness directive on any Boeing airplane models.

Major airstrike by Russia



Sanctions on Russia?



US will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine







US President Donald Trump on Sunday delivered a sharp rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's continued attacks on Ukraine.Responding to the reporters, Trump said, ""I am very disappointed with President Putin. I thought he was somebody that meant what he said. And he'll talk so beautifully and then he'll bomb people at night. We don't like that.""His remarks came after Russia launched its fourth major airstrike this month, targeting several western Ukrainian cities.According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , the Russian assault involved 597 drones and 26 missiles, killing two people, injuring 20, and damaging civilian infrastructure from Kharkiv and Sumy in the northeast to Lviv, Lutsk, and Chernivtsi in the west.Asked whether the US would impose sanctions on Russia, Trump replied, ""We're going to see what we will see tomorrow. Okay. We have the secretary general. As you know, Europe has announced sanctions. But I am very disappointed with President Putin.""A bipartisan group of US senators is pushing a sanctions bill that would give Trump broad powers to hit Russia with what they call ""sledgehammer"" measures. While Trump has so far held off, hoping to convince Putin to end the war through diplomacy, recent developments suggest his position may be shifting.During a cabinet meeting, he said, ""I'm looking at it very strongly.""A major announcement is expected Monday, when Trump will address the Russia situation and meet Nato secretary general Mark Rutte in Washington. At the same time, US special envoy Keith Kellogg will begin a new visit to Ukraine.Trump also confirmed that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv. ""We will send them Patriots, which they desperately need,"" he said. ""I haven't agreed on the number yet, but they're going to have some because they do need protection.""This marks a reversal from the White House's earlier consideration to pause some arms deliveries. A new deal is now in the works that would involve Nato paying the US for the weapons sent to Ukraine.""We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they're going to pay us 100 percent for them,"" Trump said. ""It'll be business for us.""With the war in Ukraine now stretching into its fourth year and Russian strikes intensifying, Trump’s latest statements suggest a possible turning point, combining military support, diplomatic pressure, and the looming threat of economic sanctions against Moscow.","US President Donald Trump delivered a sharp rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's continued attacks on Ukraine.

Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.





BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back. ""She met me again on Saturday around 11 am and expressed severe distress. I summoned the teacher and spoke with both parties. Shortly after she left my office, we heard screams,"" the principal said, adding, ""Internal complaint committee did not find conclusive evidence of sexual harassment.""In the principal's suspension order, the higher education department stated that ""he has failed to perform his duties in the capacity of principal of the college"". It added that ""the matter has not been handled properly"".The principal has been barred from leaving Balsore without the district collector's permission. The accused teacher's suspension order said it was based on ""prima facie evidence"".DIG (eastern range), Satyajit Naik, said the accused faculty member has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide attempt and sexual harassment.

Tejashwi Yadav Questions Validity Of 80% Bihar Voter Forms, Flags ECI Silence On Fake Uploads

Official: Poll rolls will be purged of anyone flagged as foreigner

PATNA: Bihar’s ongoing special intensive revision of electoral rolls has unearthed an unspecified number of illegal immigrants from Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar residing in the state and aiming to become voters with Aadhaar, ration cards and domicile certificates acquired through fraud, Election Commission sources said Sunday based on reports from booth-level officers.The purported findings of the door-to-door voter verification campaign have already become a political hot potato, with RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav dismissing these as “rubbish”. EC is still to make an official statement.Officials said that the final poll rolls would be purged of anyone flagged as a foreigner during the survey.The rolls are to be published on Sept 30. The house-to-house verification exercise started on June 25 with the focus on verifying places of birth. Teams conducting the survey have found “a considerable number of people from neighbouring countries” during their visits across the state, sources said.Tejashwi, leader of opposition in the state assembly, held a presser in Patna to question the credibility of the sources behind the “claim” that foreigners had infiltrated the rolls with fake papers.“Has Election Commission issued any document or press release on the matter? This claim is based on ‘sources’ whom I have no reason to believe,” he said.BJP shot back, saying Tejashwi and the rest of the opposition were “nervous” about losing their allegedly “illegal vote base”. “If Tejashwi had his way, he would allow citizens from Bangladesh and Pakistan to vote through postal ballots. No wonder the intensive rolls revision has left the entire opposition worried,” said state BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma.He accused RJD supporters of helping illegal immigrants get their names included in the rolls. “Why else is Tejashwi concerned about illegal migrants being weeded out, but not Bihari migrants outside the state who have still to be included in the electoral rolls?""",Official: Poll rolls will be purged of anyone flagged as foreigner during the survey.

NEW DELHI: The body of 19-year-old Sneha Debnath, a Delhi University student who went missing on July 7, was recovered from the Yamuna River under the Geeta Colony flyover, Delhi Police confirmed on Sunday. The discovery marks a tragic end to a week-long search operation that began after a suspected suicide note was found at her residence, ANI repoted.Sneha, a resident of South Delhi’s Paryavaran Complex and a B.Sc. Mathematics (Honours) student at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, had reportedly told close friends and family through messages and emails on the morning of her disappearance that she was in emotional distress.According to investigators, Sneha’s family discovered a note indicating her intention to jump off the Signature Bridge. A cab driver later confirmed he had dropped her there on the same day. Technical surveillance placed her last known phone location at the bridge, while eyewitnesses also reported seeing a girl standing alone at the edge of the bridge around sunrise.Moments later, she was no longer in sight.Police registered an FIR at Mehrauli Police Station under Section 140(3) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).A joint operation with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was launched, covering a wide area along the Yamuna, from Nigam Bodh Ghat to Noida. The operation led to the recovery of a female body that matched Sneha’s physical description and clothing.“We had been conducting an extensive search since July 7. The body recovered matches the description shared by her family,” a senior police official said.Friends close to Sneha revealed she had been withdrawn and visibly upset in recent months. On the morning of July 7, she sent farewell messages via email and WhatsApp to several people in her circle, raising alarms about her mental state.Although initial assessments suggest drowning as the cause of death, the police have initiated a forensic examination to rule out foul play and confirm the circumstances.Sneha hailed from Sabroom in South Tripura and had come to Delhi for higher education.

From having legs hacked off to getting Rajya Sabha foothold: Sadanandan Master's journey of grit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-having-legs-hacked-off-to-getting-rajya-sabha-foothold-a-masters-journey-of-grit/articleshow/122424644.cms,"File photo: Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: It was May 2016. Speaking at a rally in Kasaragod, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held up the hand of C Sadanandan Master as he lamented the silence imposed on the story of the victim of barbaric poll violence. Coming from a family of hardcore CPM members, the 30-year-old school teacher was influenced by the writings of poet Akkitham and turned into a votary of RSS's philosophy of cultural nationalism. He was dubbed a traitor by his comrades, who punished the defection by hacking off both his legs in 1994. The limbs were mutilated so that they could not be rejoined. The PM breached the ""silence"" on Sunday that he complained about nine years ago by announcing Sadanandan Master's nomination to Rajya Sabha - a move that lakhs of members and sympathisers of RSS would applaud.For, if the atrocity was meant to intimidate him into submission, the attackers failed miserably. Sadanandan, popularly known as Master or 'Maashay', who is now dependent on his prosthetic legs, did not let the gruesome attack deter him from taking on the powerful CPM in their stronghold of Kannur and elsewhere, and propagating Hindutva. Importantly, he has been arguing against the use of violence to settle political and ideological disagreements.If the recognition of Sadanandan Master helps explain his enduring appeal among lay supporters of RSS, the PM gave them another reason to celebrate on Sunday: the nomination of historian Meenakshi Jain. Part of the rare breed that challenged the dominant Left historiography, Jain had to endure resistance and ridicule in academic circles. She, however, earned the admiration of Hindutva circles by detailing the destruction of temples in the medieval period, a taboo area for 'mainstream' historians. Her books - 'Flight of Deities and Rebirth of Temples', 'The Battle for Rama: Case of the Temple at Ayodhya', and 'Rama and Ayodhya' - are evidence of the tenacity with which she pursued her passion. Ujjwal Nikam , the Mumbai lawyer who successfully argued for death penalty for Ajmal Kasab of 26/11 infamy and had earlier argued the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts case, is not known for his links with RSS. Yet, his nomination appears to be part of Modi rewarding those who turn out to be symbols of the cause.Ditto for Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the career diplomat who served as foreign secretary under Modi 2.0. He was seen as BJP's choice for the Darjeeling LS seat in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections before the leadership deferred to the in-house wisdom that the incumbent be retained. The PM may have gone along with the majority view, but did not let the former ambassador slip off his radar.A Leftist-turned-RSS karyakarta, Sadanandan Master's life has been one of sacrifices and a symbol of resilience and unwavering public service in the face of a brutal political attack on him in 1994 in Kannur. For 31 years, Sadanandan Master has been living with these scars when CPM workers severed both his legs, mutilated them on the surface of the road so that he couldn't undergo limb replantation and left him writhing in pain.The brutal attack didn't deter Sadanandan Master as he returned to his teaching job and social service on prosthetic legs. He has consistently spoken out against political violence, especially in Kannur, and has advocated peace and dialogue.""The psychology of violence is that of action and reaction. I am a victim of political violence, and I have always maintained that in my individual capacity, I am willing to take on any role to end this violence,"" he had told TOI in 2016.Sadanandan Master unsuccessfully contested the 2016 and 2021 assembly elections in Kerala on a BJP ticket from the Koothuparambu constituency in Kannur district. Currently, he is the vice president of BJP's Kerala unit.","C Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha.

GUWAHATI: Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I, the banned anti-talks faction of the original militant outfit of the same name that he co-founded in 1979, claimed Sunday that three of its senior members were killed in targeted pre-dawn drone attacks by the Indian Army on some ""mobile camps"" in Myanmar's Sagaing region.The Army officially denied carrying out any such aerial attacks on the camps purportedly shared by Ulfa-I and Manipur's Revolutionary People's Front (RPF) across a stretch of the India-Myanmar border, adjoining Longwa in Nagaland and Pangsau Pass in Arunachal Pradesh.Ulfa-I said the attacks came in waves between 2 am and 4 am - involving over 150 drones of Israeli and French make - and resulted in the outfit losing insurgent veterans Nayan Asom, Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom. The last two were killed in the second drone strike while attending Nayan's funeral, while 19 members were wounded, the outfit said.""There are no inputs with the Indian Army on such an operation,"" defence ministry PRO Lt Col Mahendra Rawat told TOI in Guwahati.Ulfa-I contested the statement, specifying that three drone attacks took place in the span of two hours. The outfit said residents of the border belt in Arunachal Pradesh would testify to the attacks.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who started his stint in office with an offer of talks to Ulfa-I, and state police denied any involvement or knowledge of operations against the outfit. They said there could be clarity on Ulfa-I's claim as more information arrives from the remote border.A source in the security establishment confirmed casualties in the Ulfa-I camps in Myanmar, suggesting the attacks could be the outcome of the civil war in that country with several ethnic armed groups at heart of the strife."" The ongoing civil war there has led to frequent clashes, shifting alliances and a general breakdown of state control in many areas, particularly near the international border,"" the source said. ""In this environment, attacks on insurgent camps - including those used by Ulfa-I - could plausibly originate from Myanmar's own ethnic armed organisations, or even the Myanmar military, rather than by Indian forces.""Insurgent outfits of the Northeast have had a presence in Myanmar since the late Eighties, taking advantage of the porous border and ongoing conflict there.Indian security agencies have repeatedly expressed concern over the use of Myanmarese territory by militants for hit-and-run attacks in the Northeast. There have been instances of unconfirmed Indian military action on militants across the border on several occasions.Ulfa-I's camps are said to be in the dense forests of Sagaing, with additional bases at Waktham Basti, Hoyat Basti and Hakiyot (opposite Longding district of Arunachal). Some camps are near the Pangmi Naga-inhabited area, and along the China-Myanmar border. Manipur-based groups, including Manipur outfits like People's Liberation Army (PLA), KYKL and PREPAK. RPF is the political wing of PLA.The NSCN-K(YA) faction has its headquarters and camps in Naga-inhabited regions of Sagaing, often within a 6 to 10km radius of the other militant bases. The locations keep changing, based on what's happening on the Indian side.

CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

KOLKATA: A forensic team collected Sunday soft drink and water bottles, two types of hair strands, and other samples from a sealed hostel room in a premier Kolkata management institute, where a 24-year-old psychologist accused a student of drugging and raping her during a supposed counselling session. However, the probe hit a wall as the ""woman and her family refused to cooperate"".""In an ideal situation, we would have spoken to the survivor at length, got her medico-legal test done, and collected her clothes and phone, which are all crucial evidence in such a probe. However, we haven't been able to do this as the survivor is not cooperating. We called her to the police station, but she has not come,"" said a senior officer.The woman alleged she was offered pizza and a drink after being invited to the male student's hostel room Friday. But the case took a turn within 12 hours of the complaint when her father publicly denied any crime had occurred and accused police of coercion. The family's two-storey house in a semi-urban village, 12km from the B-school, may hold answers to the silence. The village is a curious mix of modernity and tradition - paved roads, gaming computers, and women running sewing schools - yet still bends under the weight of conservatism.Cellphones buzz in every household. As does silence when questions of justice arise.Attempts to reach the survivor's family were thwarted by four youths on bikes. ""They have nothing to say. They are not at home,"" one of them said curtly. The woman's advocate father declined to speak. Kamal Mia, a 60-year-old village elder who prays thrice daily at the local mosque, said: ""My grandson is studying medicine. There's a big difference between new and old generations.""A nine-member SIT began work amid what officials called ""zero help"" from the complainant and her family. Police collected logbooks from the main gate and hostel entrance, along with CCTV footage from multiple campus zones, in an attempt to build a timeline and verify claims.The family's silence isn't restricted to police.

KULLU: It does take a village to raise a child. An 11-month-old baby was left all alone when her parents and grandmother were swept away in flashfloods following a cloudburst in Mandi district on June 30. What followed the tragedy was a heartwarming tale of a community turning into a family.Orphaned, yet surrounded by love, little Nikita still looks for her mother in the crowd of familiar and unfamiliar faces but gentle hands and kind eyes try to fill the void.There was no dearth of hearts reaching out to adopt her but Nikita's relatives decided Sunday, after her parents' last rites - she would live with her paternal aunt, Kirna Devi. Several schools have also called up the family, offering to enrol Nikita, who turns one on Aug 14, for free when the time comes.Nikita had a miraculous escape on the night of June 30 when a flashflood, triggered by a cloudburst, struck Talwara village of Gohar subdivision in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district. While Nikita survived the gushing torrents, most of her family members were swept away.Her 31-year-old father, Ramesh Kumar, was trying to stop the water from entering the house when the waters roared in.His body was later found amid debris nearby. The baby's 24-year-old mother, Radha Devi, and 59-year-old grandmother, Poornu Devi, were also washed away. No trace has been found of them.Talwara village lay devastated. When villagers went about checking on families and assessing damage, an elderly neighbour heard Nikita crying and alerted relatives.Nikita's aunts, Tara Devi and Kirna Devi, took her in their care. And the entire community reached out to the orphaned child.When word got around, Nikita's relatives and the Mandi district administration began receiving calls from couples, even from abroad, to adopt her.

Martyrs Day clampdown: ‘Jammu and Kashmir government under detention’ to prevent visits to graveyard; CM calls it a ‘shame’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyrs-day-clampdown-jammu-and-kashmir-government-under-detention-to-prevent-visits-to-graveyard-cm-calls-it-a-shame/articleshow/122423538.cms,"File photo: J&K CM Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah was barred Sunday from visiting a graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar, and most of his cabinet colleagues were detained in their homes along with scores of others to keep them away from the site, virtually putting the National Conference (NC) govt under lockdown.Among the other key political figures J&K police confined to their homes were Omar’s father and NC president Farooq Abdullah, former ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone.Omar called the restrictions a “shame” and described “13th July massacre as our Jallianwala Bagh” as he slammed the first such clampdown since his govt took charge in Oct 2024. The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, an arrangement that took shape after the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370.Nasir Aslam Wani, Omar’s political adviser, said the CM had been outside J&K and returned to Srinagar on Sunday but was not allowed to proceed towards Naqshband Sahib, the resting place of 22 people killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh on July 13, 1931. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history.According to Wani, Omar remained in his house after being stopped. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC was in Jammu but his Srinagar house was locked.Wani said he himself had been shut in since 3 am Sunday. “An elected government was placed under house detention in J&K by the very people who hailed the 2024 assembly elections as a triumph of democracy. The irony is not just strange, it is tragic,” NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq told TOI.Omar expressed anger, calling the curbs “blatantly undemocratic” with troops deployed as jailers and major bridges in Srinagar blocked. “I will never understand what the law-and-order govt is so afraid of,” Omar said in a swipe at authorities under LG Sinha.Since early Sunday, authorities shut down major routes. Security was tightened at Gupkar Road, home to top politicians including Farooq, Omar, education minister Sakina Itoo and CPM MLA MY Tarigami. I too posted that she had been “put under house arrest since last (Saturday) night”. The NC head office was sealed with concertina wire. PDP office was shut, too. A popular Sunday flea market in the Lal Chowk area was not allowed. All roads leading to the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib were closed. Senior cops were at the site.Amid the restrictions, Omar sought to counter the established narrative on the 1931 uprising by likening it to Jallianwala Bagh and claiming it was against the British. “The people who laid down their lives did so against the British. Kashmir was being ruled under the British Paramountcy. What a shame that true heroes who fought against British rule in all its forms are today projected as villains only because they were Muslims. We may be denied the opportunity to visit their graves today but we will not forget their sacrifices,” the CM posted.PDP chief Mehbooba called for “acceptance” of the martyrs. “The day you accept our heroes as your own just as Kashmiris have embraced yours, from Mahatma Gandhi to Bhagat Singh, that day, as Prime Minister Modi once said, the dil ki doori (distance of hearts) will truly end,” Mehbooba said. Former PDP minister Naeem Akhtar, also locked in, posted that “it feels like we are in 1931”.In Jammu, the BJP leader of opposition, Sunil Sharma, sought to contest projections of the 1931 episode as martyrdom. He had sparked bedlam in the assembly this March by calling the martyrs “traitors”. “Communal violence was given a false narrative of martyrdom. The recent remarks by Omar, equating Islamist rioters with freedom fighters, are an insult to the nation and its true freedom struggle,” Sharma said Sunday.Deputy CM Choudhary hit back with a veiled jab at the BJP. “If they admire Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, what’s wrong in remembering the July 13 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the rights of people?” Choudhary asked as NC functionaries in Jammu paid tributes.",J&K chief minister barred from visiting graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar.

LG Manoj Sinha, who completes five years at J&K Raj Bhavan, told TOI’s Bharti Jain that the Pahalgam terror attack was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. “The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide.

” “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”

Excerpts from the interview:

Has the Pahalgam attack shattered the myth that terrorism is on the wane in J&K?

There has been no attack in J&K since Operation Sindoor. Do you think this will hold?

Is local involvement in Pahalgam attack a worry for security agencies?

How has the Pahalgam incident impacted tourism in J&K?

What is the status on tourist destinations closed after Pahalgam attack?

What happened in Pahalgam was very unfortunate; innocent people were brutally killed. I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure. The common belief here has been that terrorists do not target tourists. The location where the attack took place is an open meadow. There is no facility or room for security forces to be present there.This was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. The arrests made by NIA in the case corroborate local involvement but it would still be wrong to conclude that the security environment in J&K stands completely vitiated. The attack was a debilitating and deliberate strike on the nation’s soul. The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide and trigger a backlash against the people of J&K living in other parts of the country, adding to the feeling of alienation.Pakistan doesn’t want J&K to be peaceful and prosperous. In the past five years, the J&K economy’s size has doubled. Tourists have been flocking in high numbers. This (attack) was a hit by Pakistan at the economic well-being of Kashmir. But condemnation and protests by the people of Kashmir following the attack provided a befitting reply to Pakistan and terror outfits. They were clear signs that terrorism is not acceptable here anymore.Operation Sindoor has drawn red lines for Pakistan. India has made it clear that any terror attack will be considered an act of war. The manner in which our forces carried out precise hits against terror facilities in Pakistan, and when it tried to target our military and civilian assets, how they destroyed their airbases, conveyed a stern message to Pakistan. Still, a country that has made terrorism its declared state policy, is not to be trusted. I am confident that the home ministry, defence ministry and our intelligence agencies are keeping a watch on Pakistan. But it is a fact that there has been no terror attack in J&K after Operation Sindoor.Local terror recruitment is at an all-time low. There has been just one incident of local recruitment this year as compared to 6 to 7 last year; there was a time when this figure used to be 150-200. But it is also a fact that Pakistan has facilitated the infiltration of a large number of terrorists in both Jammu region and Kashmir region.Tourist arrivals had almost stopped after the Pahalgam incident. We believed that the Amarnath yatra would be turning point.We have already opened many. Others will be opened too in a phased manner. This is being done after finalising a robust security plan for each one of them.","LG Manoj Sinha, who completes five years at J&K Raj Bhavan, told TOI’s Bharti Jain that the Pahalgam terror attack was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. “The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide.” “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122426796,imgsize-934038,width-400,resizemode-4/122426796.jpg"

A health worker posted in Bhojpur district, he leaves for office early every morning and, after reaching work, repeatedly calls his wife to check whether the forms have arrived.""There are 13 votes in my household, and if our names are not included in the electoral rolls, we will cease to be voters. Time is running out, and we are all quite worried,"" Sinha shared over the phone on Sunday.The last date for submitting EFs is July 25. With no option left, he finally contacted the district election officer's office, which assured him that the BLO concerned would be sent to his residence ""very soon"".Munna Singh, a cloth trader residing in Patna's Friends Colony, echoed Raju's concern: ""No BLO has visited our area in past 18 days."" The experience of Umesh Singh, a social worker, is no different. ""No BLO has come to my house in Vijay Nagar locality.

While many have taken the initiative to go to the nearest polling booths or contact BLOs after obtaining their mobile numbers, a large number are yet to submit their EFs. Election Commission (EC) claims that more than 80 per cent of the EFs have already been collected, stating that four out of every five electors have submitted their forms, even as complaints of ""missing"" BLOs persist.As per EC guidelines, BLOs are required to conduct door-to-door enumeration in three steps: first, to distribute the EFs to all existing electors; second, to guide them in filling out the forms; and third, to collect the completed EFs along with the necessary documents.Deputy election officer of Patna, Ashutosh Rai, said BLOs were actively engaged in the task and would reach every household. ""There is nothing to worry about. If they haven't reached today, they will definitely come tomorrow,"" he told TOI.However, leader of opposition in the assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, dismissed EC's claim of 80 per cent EF collection. ""This claim is fake. What can we say about others?

Nikam’s devotion to legal field, Constitution is exemplary: PM

NEW DELHI: Prominent lawyer Ujjwal Nikam and retired diplomat Harsh Vardhan Shringla were among four distinguished individuals nominated to Rajya Sabha by President Droupadi Murmu , filling vacancies that had lingered for nearly a year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X to announce the nominations, which also included C Sadanandan Master, a prominent RSS worker from Kerala; and eminent historian Meenakshi Jain.Sadanandan Master had lost his legs in an attack by CPM goons in 1994 and now walks with prosthetic limbs. The PM highlighted his life as the epitome of courage and refusal to bow to injustice.Violence and intimidation couldn’t deter his spirit towards national development. His efforts as a teacher and social worker are also commendable. He is extremely passionate towards youth empowerment,” Modi said.Nikam had made an unsuccessful bid for the Lok Sabha from Mumbai North Central in the 2024 elections as a BJP candidate, and his defeat had left many disheartened.

Texas was hit by another round of heavy rain on Sunday, just nine days after devastating flash floods claimed over 120 lives in one of the deadliest natural disasters in the state’s history, Kerr and Gillespie Counties were hit with a “life-threatening” flash flooding on Sunday with rainfall rates projected to reach 1 to 2 inches per hour.The Sheriff's office of Kerr County had issued a “code red” urging that it ""is not an evacuation but a preparation notification. Be prepared to evacuate along the Guadalupe River due to bad weather and flooding,” to the population of 50,000 in the county.Kerr County was the most severely affected area as the Guadalupe River rose 20 feet in just 90 minutes during the early hours of July 4, claiming the lives of 27 counselors and children at a Christian summer camp, as reported by the New York Post.Search operations were put to a halt as heavy rains lashed Texas. In Kerrville, where local officials have faced criticism for failing to properly warn residents about the rising water in the early hours of July 4, authorities went door-to-door after midnight early Sunday to notify some homes of potential flooding. Phone alerts were also sent out to residents in the area, as reported by AP.The flood warning is effective till 7 pm (local time) on Sunday.Ingram fire department officials ordered crews to immediately clear out the Guadalupe River corridor in Kerr County as search efforts were paused, warning of potential flash floods.“We will provide more information soon but for now, all search crews need to evacuate the river corridor until further notice,” the police department of Kerrville stated on Sunday.Brian Lochte, agency spokesman said that the search efforts would continue on Monday morning by the Ingram Fire Department.Texas governor Greg Abbott posted on X on Sunday that, “Texas Task Force One and Texas Parks & Wildlife are making swift water rescues in Lampasas County. We continue to monitor all counties with a focus on saving lives.”Governor Abbott announced that the state has broadened its rescue operations, launched last week in Kerr County, to now include San Saba, Lampasas, and Schleicher counties, with evacuations underway in Lampasas, Menard, Kimble, and Sutton counties.The most recent wave of flooding damaged around 100 homes and destroyed extensive stretches of cattle fencing, according to Ashley Johnson, CEO of the San Saba-based nonprofit Hill Country Community Action Association, as reported by AP.“Anything you can imagine in a rural community was damaged,” said Johnson. “Our blessing is it was daylight and we knew it was coming.”“Everyone is just doing what they can to help their neighbors,” she added.Forecasters cautioned that the Guadalupe river could swell to nearly 15 feet (4.6 metres) by Sunday afternoon, approximately five feet above the flood stage, potentially submerging the Highway 39 bridge in Hunt, a small town where camp mystic is located.“Numerous secondary roads and bridges are flooded and very dangerous,” said a weather service warning.","Texas was hit by another round of heavy rain on Sunday, just nine days after devastating flash floods claimed over 120 lives.

Iranians SHAME Pezeshkian For ‘Conveying Tehran’s Weakness’ To U.S. | ‘Submissive, Weak President’





President Donald Trump Friday referred to defense secretary Pete Hegseth as the secretary of war, leading to confusion as to whether it was slip or whether Trump wants to bring back the position that the country didn't have since 1947. ""Secretary of War Pete Hegseth was great on FoxNews this morning. Talking about modern weapons and warfare. Thank you also to Brett Velicovich, who really knows his “stuff.” We are really on our way. MAGA!"" Trump posted on Truth Social.The position of Secretary of War was a high‑level cabinet role in the U.S. government from 1789 until its dissolution in 1947. Initially, while serving under the Articles of Confederation (1781–1789), it was known as “Secretary at War.” Benjamin Lincoln and Henry Knox held the rank during this early period. Under the new Constitution, George Washington appointed Henry Knox as the first official Secretary of War, entrusting him with all military affairs—including naval matters—until the Department of the Navy was created in 1798.The office was eventually discontinued by the National Security Act of 1947, which split its duties into the newly formed Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force, both reporting to the Secretary of Defense, who now occupies the cabinet-level role.The final Secretary of War, Kenneth C. Royall, briefly served in that role in 1947 before transitioning to become the first Secretary of the Army.Hegseth has issued a new directive to increase the arsenal of drones. On Thursday, he spoke about it as a drone came to hand him a memo which Hegseth then signed. The memo was titled ""Unleasing US Military Drone Dominance"". “This is the future,” he declared. “We’re in the fight. We’re in the fight to win it. And we’re never gonna back down.""","The position of Secretary of War was a high‑level cabinet role in the U.S. government from 1789 until its dissolution in 1947.

Speculations that Dan Bongino will resign gave in to theories that FBI director Kash Patel will also resign as Bongino is his right-hand person and Patel too agrees with Bongino's sentiment that he is being blamed over the situation unfairly.

Case that shocked France



Pelicot encourages survivors of sexual assault







Gisele Pelicot, the French woman whose courage in publicly testifying about the decade-long sexual abuse she endured made her a symbol of women's rights in France, has received the country's highest civilian honour.Pelicot was named a knight of the Legion of Honour in a list published Sunday, ahead of France's Bastille Day celebrations.She joins 588 others on this year's list.Pelicot gained international recognition after she testified against her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, who had drugged and raped her and invited strangers to assault her for more than a decade.Dominique Pelicot was convicted last year of aggravated rape and sentenced to 20 years in prison.In a landmark ruling, a court in Avignon sentenced his 50 co-defendants to prison terms ranging from three to 15 years.The case shocked France and reignited a national debate over sexual violence and legal protections for victims.Pelicot, who insisted the trial be held publicly, has been praised for helping push for reforms in France's rape laws. Following the trial, the French Senate passed a bill that includes a lack of consent in the country's criminal definition of rape.In her closing statement at the trial of the 51 men accused of raping her, Pelicot said, ""It's time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes… It's time we changed the way we look at rape.""",Gisele Pelicot was named a knight of the Legion of Honour in a list published Sunday.

President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new and more aggressive plan to arm Ukraine, marking a significant change in his administration’s approach to the ongoing war with Russia. According to two sources who spoke to Axios, the package is expected to include offensive weapons, long-range missiles, and sophisticated systems such as Patriot air defence batteries.The announcement is expected Monday, coinciding with a series of high-level meetings, including Trump’s scheduled talks with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and a new visit to Ukraine by the US special envoy. Trump’s move comes just days after the Pentagon paused some weapons deliveries to Ukraine, citing concerns about dwindling US stockpiles. Now, with Trump’s renewed commitment, the weapons are expected to start flowing again.“We will send them Patriots, which they desperately need,” Trump told reporters on Sunday at Joint Base Andrews. “I haven’t agreed on the number yet, but they’re going to have some because they do need protection.”This would represent a major departure from Trump’s previous stance. For months, he resisted escalating the conflict by limiting U.S.support to defensive weapons only. But as his frustration with Vladimir Putin grows, that calculus appears to be shifting.“Putin really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said, signalling his growing disillusionment with the Russian president. “We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they're going to pay us 100 percent for them… It'll be business for us.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently said the two countries were “close to reaching a multi-level agreement on new Patriot systems and missiles,” and described his summit meeting with Trump as their “best so far.”Meanwhile, Congress is also stepping up pressure. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said a bipartisan bill would give Trump the power to impose “500 percent tariffs” on any country aiding Russia, calling it a “sledgehammer” to end the war. Trump hinted at possible sanctions, saying, “We’re going to see what we will see tomorrow.”","US President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new and more aggressive plan to arm Ukraine, marking a significant change in his administration’s approach to the ongoing war with Russia.

Operation Sindoor proved India’s readiness; exposed inefficiency of Pak’s Chinese military gear: US warfare expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-proved-indias-readiness-exposed-inefficiency-of-paks-chinese-military-gear-us-warfare-expert/articleshow/122408721.cms,".

New Delhi: India’s Operation Sindoor was not just a warning to Pakistan, but a signal to the world about India’s military strength, says international security expert John Spencer. According to him, the strikes showed that India has both the capability and the will to respond with precision and restraint.Spencer, who is Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute (New York), told ANI in a video interview that the operation became a direct test of Indian-made systems versus Chinese military technology used by Pakistan.“This is absolutely a test of Chinese military technologies, both for the rest of the world and also for China,” he said. “It (China) uses it (Pakistan) as a lab for this technology.”India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, after a terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 civilians. In the days that followed, India repelled Pakistani military action and hit back at key airbases. Hostilities ended after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to the Indian side.Spencer said India’s response highlighted not just its military upgrades but also how prepared it was: “War puts everything to the test… and everybody was learning from that demonstration.”He also noted that the ineffectiveness of Chinese-made weapons used by Pakistan is under scrutiny.“The evidence was in the video, satellite footage — not in the words about how you said your Chinese systems performed.”Spencer described the situation as part of a broader “proxy warfare” dynamic, where countries like China and Turkey back Pakistan with defence ties. “There are a lot of nuances… using Pakistan and these borders to isolate India economically and militarily,” he said.He added that India’s pattern of response to cross-border terrorism has shaped a doctrine, and while wars cannot be predicted, preparation is key. “One of the ways you prevent future wars is through preparation, change, and being on the ground.”Discussing Pakistan’s reliance on Chinese gear, Spencer said there could be a rethink. “If what you bought doesn’t work, then you go back to the seller and say, ‘This didn’t work like it was supposed to.’ But you also know if there’s user error.”He added that Pakistan may now seek advanced weapons elsewhere, but money is a major problem. “They have a money problem. The IMF has to bail Pakistan out.”Spencer said he studied Operation Sindoor not just for what happened in those four days, but because it reflected years of transformation and innovation in India’s defence sector. “India is more prepared,” he said.","India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK.

We'll obviously observe their activities and monitor their presence around Australia, but we'll also adjust how we conduct those exercises,"" Conroy added.Conroy said the Chinese were not yet shadowing ships as of Sunday.The exercise officially started on Sunday with a ceremony in Sydney attended by Deputy Commanding General of US Army Pacific Lt Gen J B Vowell and Australia's Chief of Joint Operations Vice-Adm Justin Jones.The exercise, showcasing Australia's defence alliance with the United States, started a day after Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began a six-day visit to China.Albanese is expected to hold his fourth face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday.The Australian leader has been criticised at home for failing to secure a face-to-face meeting with US President Donald Trump.","Exercise Talisman Sabre began in 2005 as a biennial joint exercise between the United States and Australia. This year, more than 35,000 military personnel from 19 nations will take part over three weeks.

JERUSALEM: At least eight Palestinians, most of them children, were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in central Gaza Sunday, officials said, in a missile strike which Israel said missed its intended target. The Israeli military said it had intended to hit an Islamic Jihad militant in the area but that a malfunction had caused the missile to fall “dozens of metres from the target”.“The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians,” it said, adding that the incident was under review. The strike hit a water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp, killing six children and injuring 17 others, said Ahmed Abu Saifan, an emergency physician at Al-Awda Hospital.Water shortage in Gaza has worsened sharply in recent weeks, with fuel shortages causing desalination and sanitation facilities to close, making people dependent on collection centres where they can fill up their plastic containers.In another attack, Palestinian media said a prominent hospital consultant was among 12 people killed by an Israeli strike mid-morning on a busy market in Gaza City. Gaza’s health ministry said on Sunday that more than 58,000 people had been killed since the start of the war in October 2023, with 139 people added to the toll over the past 24 hours.The ministry says over half of those killed are women and children.Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire appeared to be deadlocked, with the two sides divided over the extent of an eventual Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian enclave, Palestinian and Israeli sources said at the weekend.The indirect talks over a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire were continuing in Doha, but optimism that surfaced last week of a possible deal has largely faded, with both sides accusing each other of intransigence.REUTERS","Israeli military said it had intended to hit an Islamic Jihad militant in the area but that a malfunction had caused the missile to fall ‘dozens of metres from the target’ The strike hit a water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp, killing six children and injuring 17 others.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122428047,imgsize-843388,width-400,resizemode-4/122428047.jpg"
