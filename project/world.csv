NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke on Wednesday about Kashmir and actions taken by the Union government, including the removal of Article 370 , economic measures, and elections with high voter turnout. He also discussed Brics countries' views on the use of the dollar in the international economy.He made these remarks during a session titled ""India’s Rise and Role in the World"" at the Chatham House think tank in London.When asked about Kashmir, Jaishankar said, ""In Kashmir, we have done a good job solving most of it. I think removing Article 370 was one step. Then, restoring growth, economic activity and social justice in Kashmir was step number two. Holding elections, which were done with a very high turnout, was step number three. I think the part we are waiting for is the return of the stolen part of Kashmir, which is on the illegal Pakistani occupation. When that's done, I assure you, Kashmir solved.""Jaishankar also said that the US administration under President Donald Trump is moving towards multipolarity, which aligns with India's interests. He said that both countries have agreed on the need for a bilateral trade agreement .""We see a president and an administration which, in our parlance, is moving towards multipolarity and that is something that suits India,"" he said.Referring to the Quad alliance of the US, India, Australia, and Japan, he said, ""From President Trump’s perspective, the one big shared enterprise that we have is the Quad, which is an understanding where everybody pays their fair share… There are no free riders involved. So that’s a good model which works.""Regarding tariffs, Jaishankar said that commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington for discussions on a bilateral trade pact following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump at the White House last month.""We had a very open conversation about it (tariffs) and the result of that conversation was that we agreed on the need for a bilateral trade agreement,"" he said.Jaishankar also addressed topics such as India’s relationship with China, the internationalisation of the Rupee, and the role of the dollar in the global economy.On China, he noted some developments since October 2024, including the opening of the Mount Kailash pilgrimage route in Tibet.""We have a very, very unique relationship with China as the only two billion plus populated countries in the world… we want a relationship where our interests are respected, sensitivities are recognised and works for both of us,"" he said.Jaishankar is on an official visit to the United Kingdom and Ireland from March 4 to 9 to strengthen India's ties with both countries.","Jaishankar said that the US administration under President Donald Trump is moving towards multipolarity, which aligns with India's interests.

I studied with him at Cambridge, where he had failed. Failing at Cambridge University is very difficult because the university tries to ensure that everyone at least passes. But despite that, Rajiv Gandhi failed,"" Aiyar said.""After that, he went to Imperial College in London, and he failed there as well. Then I thought, how can such a person become the Prime Minister of the country?” he added.Meanwhile, reacting to the remarks, Congress termed Aiyar as a frustrated individual and claimed that Rajiv Gandhi gave the country a modern outlook""I don't want to comment on someone who is frustrated individual. I knew Rajiv Gandhi, who gave the country a modern outlook. He took concrete steps for the liberalisation of the economy as well,"" Congress leader Harish Rawat said.""It is unfortunate that a section of the party (Congress) did not stand with him, or else the country's history would have been something else. His speeches as LoP still guide leaders."" he added.This comes after Aiyar had claimed that his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis.During an interview with PTI, he mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi, and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them. So, the irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" he told PTI.Aiyar was a close aide of Rajiv Gandhi when he entered politics. His inner circle also included his cousin Arun Nehru, friend Arun Singh and Sam Pitroda.This is not the first time that Mani Shankar Aiyar's remarks have led to controversy.Aiyar triggered a row when he said that the Chinese in 1962 ""allegedly invaded India"".In 2017, during campaign for the Gujarat assembly elections, Aiyar had stoked a major controversy and caused considerable damage to the electoral prospects of the grand old party after he used objectionable words against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Congress reacted by suspending Aiyar from the party. Two years later in 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Aiyar defiantly recalled his remarks against Modi and tried to justify it.Earlier in 2014, Aiyar had made a chaiwala jibe at Narendra Modi, who was then the BJP's prime ministerial candidate.","BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared an excerpt of Aiyar's interview on X, and said: ""Let the veil be stripped"" In the video, the Congress leader said that Rajiv Gandhi struggled academically and many questioned his competency to become Prime Minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118732791,imgsize-39554,width-400,resizemode-4/118732791.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India-UK ties contribute to stability and prosperity in an uncertain and volatile world, said foreign minister S Jaishankar after ""wide-ranging and productive"" talks with his counterpart David Lammy during which they discussed major regional and global issues including the Ukraine conflict , West Asia situation and also developments in Bangladesh and the Commonwealth.Before his meeting with Lammy, Jaishankar had also called on UK PM Keir Starmer and held talks with UK's home and trade secretaries, Yvette Cooper and Jonathan Reynolds respectively, focusing on issues like extremism and the ongoing FTA talks.""We discussed the entire gamut of bilateral ties, especially our focus on strategic coordination, political cooperation, trade deal negotiation, education, technology, mobility and people-to-people exchanges.

In his meeting with Starmer, Jaishankar had discussed taking forward bilateral, economic ties and enhancing people to people exchanges.Starmer also shared the UK's perspective on the Ukraine conflict in the meeting. The UK PM this week proposed a four-step plan that included development of a ""coalition of the willing"" in Europe to guarantee peace for Ukraine. He also committed to ""boots on the ground, and planes in the air"", saying Europe must do the heavy lifting. India, however, has continued to maintain that enduring peace is possible only through dialogue and diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine.For India, Bangladesh continues to pose a big challenge because of increasing radicalisation and the threat to regional stability. Jaishankar has remained in touch with Lammy about developments in Dhaka right from the time Hasina was deposed.","India-UK ties contribute to stability and prosperity in an uncertain and volatile world.

Dallewal completes 100 days of fast:

BATHINDA/CHANDIGARH: Punjab farmers' march to Chandigarh following Samyukt Kisan Morcha 's (SKM) call for a week-long protest from March 5 was headed off at multiple points by police, largely restricting the protesters to their districts.The farmers, who moved towards Chandigarh on tractor-trolleys and other vehicles on Wednesday, were stopped on various highways.Chandigarh police, too, put up barricades at Chandigarh-Mohali border points to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the city. Security was also increased at these points, with police personnel checking vehicles, especially buses.Many farmer union representatives, including Joginder Singh Ugrahan, were detained and later released. SKM strongly condemned AAP govt headed by Bhagwant Mann for detaining octogenarian union representatives, including Ugrahan, Balbir Singh Rajewal and Ruldu Singh Mansa, and demanded an apology.SKM said thousands of farmers started protests on roads at more than 35 centres, as they were prevented by police from going to Chandigarh. They claimed more than 15,000 farmers had joined the protests across the state, despite the arrest and detention of nearly 350 farm activists the previous day.Countering Punjab CM Mann's remarks blaming farmer associations for making Punjab a ""state of dharnas"", SKM said farmers did not block road or rail traffic. The traffic blockades in Chandigarh and across the state were not because of the farmers' struggle, but the unwarranted restrictions imposed by Punjab Police and administration, SKM said. Kisan Mazdoor Morcha burnt Punjab chief minister's effigies in Amritsar to protest the police action.SKM (Non-Political) representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Wednesday completed 100 days of his fast unto death in support of farmers' demands , especially with regard to MSP. In a statement to mark the day, Dallewal reiterated his resolve to continue his agitation and urged central govt to accept farmers' demands. Mostly confined to his makeshift chamber on Khanauri-Data Singh Wala border of Punjab and Haryana during these three months, Dallewal had participated in talks with Union ministers on Feb 14 and 22. Over the past few days, Dallewal has not come out of the chamber as his blood pressure has been fluctuating. His fast has also affected the functioning of his kidneys.","Punjab farmers' march to Chandigarh headed off at multiple points by police.

‘Basic safeguards ignored’: Hathras panel on stampede

HATHRAS: A judicial commission investigating the deadly stampede at a 'satsang' in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, in which 121 people died on July 2 last year, has placed the blame squarely on "" administrative lapses "" while acknowledging the possibility of a larger conspiracy. The report did not hold Bhole Baba aka Narayan Saakar Hari personally responsible for the incident and instead pointed to administrative failures and his 'sevadars' as key factors contributing to the tragedy.In its 1,680-page report, tabled in the UP assembly on Wednesday, the panel said while permission had been granted for an audience of 80,000, the turnout swelled to 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh. It said the administration did not make any effort to check the arrangements.Led by retired Allahabad HC judge Brijesh Kumar Srivastava, along with retired IAS officer Hemant Rao and former IPS officer Bhavesh Kumar Singh, the commission said “basic safeguards had been ignored”. In response to the findings, the commission has put forward more than 20 recommendations aimed at preventing such disasters in the future. The report pointed out that there had been no proper route plan for the arrival and departure of self-styled preacher Bhole Baba, a factor that added to the disorder. It added that fire safety protocols and emergency measures, conditions required for event approval, had never been implemented, nor had the administration made any effort to verify these arrangements.It said the situation became even more precarious as Bhole Baba’s ‘sevadars’ took charge of crowd control rather than law enforcement agencies, preventing police from overseeing the gathering. This, the commission noted, raised the possibility of a conspiracy. “No prior information regarding individuals posted as sevadars, commanders etc was shared with police, hence their verification remained incomplete. Such individuals could potentially be involved in a conspiracy to discredit govt, amplify the event, or exploit the situation,” the report said.The commission added that although preparations for the event had begun nearly 10 days in advance, with devotees arriving in phases, there had been no inspection by officials from police, administration, fire department, PWD, UP Roadways, or any other relevant agency. The lack of oversight and coordination, the panel concluded, significantly contributed to the tragedy. Following the report’s release, Bhole Baba’s advocate A P Singh “welcomed” its conclusions, asserting it had cleared his client of any wrongdoing. “The judicial commission constituted by CM Adityanath has given a clean chit to my client. The report also exposed the conspirators who made allegations against my client,” he said.","A judicial commission investigating the deadly stampede at a'satsang' in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, in which 121 people died on July 2 last year, has placed the blame squarely on 'administrative lapses' The report did not hold Bhole Baba aka Narayan Saakar Hari personally responsible for the incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118743477,imgsize-1288841,width-400,resizemode-4/118743477.jpg"

The action followed failed talks between SKM and Punjab government on Monday evening, with farmers accusing chief minister Bhagwant Mann of walking out in frustration.Mann defended the police action, saying protests should not cause public inconvenience. ""I am the custodian of 3.5 crore people... Such actions trouble the public. How will the food grain godowns be cleared if the rails are blocked?""

A ‘rising star’ takes the stage

What to expect from Slotkin’s response

The stakes are high

Senator Elissa Slotkin , a former CIA analyst and rising Democratic star, will deliver her party’s response to President Donald Trump ’s address to Congress on Tuesday. Slotkin, who won Michigan’s Senate seat last year in a fiercely contested race, is set to present the Democratic vision in a speech that aims to counter Trump’s expected rhetoric.Slotkin, 48, made history as the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate and now represents a key swing state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost in the 2024 election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called her ""great on both economic and national security issues,"" touting her as the ideal choice to take on Trump in primetime.""From our economic security to our national security, we've got to chart a way forward that actually improves people's lives in the country we all love,"" Slotkin said in a statement ahead of her speech.Slotkin’s rebuttal is expected to hammer home the Democrats’ key message: protecting working-class Americans while Republicans ""cut taxes for their billionaire donors and Elon Musk ,"" as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries put it. She will focus on lowering the cost of living, defending Social Security and Medicaid , and presenting a stark contrast to Trump’s economic policies.Her selection signals the Democratic Party’s intent to showcase moderate voices with strong national security credentials. Before entering politics, Slotkin served as a CIA analyst and held key roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations. She was deployed to Iraq three times before moving to the National Security Council and the Pentagon.Slotkin’s speech comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump’s return to Washington reigniting fierce political battles. As one of the Senate’s newest faces, she will need to balance Democratic priorities while appealing to the swing voters who helped her secure Michigan.With her intelligence background and centrist credentials, Slotkin may prove to be one of the Democrats’ strongest voices against Trump—both on Tuesday night and in the battles ahead.","Elissa Slotkin, 48, is a rising Democratic star who won Michigan's Senate seat last year.

US Defence Secretary: 'We're prepared': US on China's 'ready for any type of war' warning as Donald Trump tariff row escalates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/were-prepared-us-on-chinas-ready-for-any-type-of-war-warning-as-donald-trump-tariff-row-escalates/articleshow/118747024.cms,"Pete Hegseth

'ON HIS WAY': Hegseth gives update on fate of arrested Abbey Gate terrorist

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday said that the United States is ""prepared"" to go to war with China, following warnings from Beijing over rising trade tensions.Hegseth's response came amidst an X post from China’s US Embassy, which said, “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.” He made the remarks while appearing on Fox & Friends.The 44-year-old Pentagon chief fired back: “We’re prepared. Those who long for peace must prepare for war.”Hegseth stressed that military strength is key to deterring conflict, saying, “That’s why we’re rebuilding our military. If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong, and that president understands peace comes through strength.”His comments come as tensions soar between Washington and Beijing after US President Trump doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% this week. China retaliated swiftly, announcing its own 10%-15% tariffs on various US agricultural products, while also restricting 25 American firms from exporting and investing in China on national security grounds.Hegseth pointed out the rapid expansion of China’s military, “They’re rapidly increasing their defence spending, modern technology, they want to supplant the United States,"" he said.Despite the heated rhetoric, Hegseth insisted that Trump maintains a “great relationship” with Chinese President Xi Jinping.“Where we can cooperate, we will,” he said. “The president is seeking peace and opportunities.”Furthermore, Hegseth made it clear that his top priority is military readiness. “My job as the Secretary of Defence is to make sure we’re ready. We need the defence spending, the capabilities, the weapons, and the posture in the Indo-Pacific, which is something we’re very much focused on.”China has announced a 7.2% rise in its defence budget as it pushes forward with modernising its military. It already boasts the world’s largest navy and is the second-highest military spender after the US.Trade disputes are not the only source of friction between US and China. The White House has accused Beijing of failing to curb the flow of fentanyl into the US, a claim Chinese officials reject. They argue that America alone is responsible for its fentanyl crisis and suggest the issue is being used as a pretext for economic penalties.Trump has also criticised Canada and Mexico for not doing enough to stop fentanyl trafficking, imposing 25% tariffs on all imports from both countries alongside the fresh Chinese tariffs.Beijing accused the US of using the fentanyl crisis as a “flimsy excuse” to justify the tariff hikes and announced retaliatory measures against American goods.""If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said .His remarks came after the Trump administration raised tariffs on all Chinese imports from 10% to 20%. Beijing responded with a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, while also imposing a 10% duty on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, according to the State Council Tariff Commission.Analysts suggest China’s countermeasures are designed to target industries with strong ties to the Trump administration’s voter base, leaving room for negotiations to prevent further economic damage. ""China’s tariffs give it room for negotiations to potentially avoid even more damaging tariffs down the road,"" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of the China Center for the Conference Board.","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the United States is ""prepared"" to go to war with China.

US Supreme Court orders Donald Trump administration to release frozen foreign aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-orders-donald-trump-administration-to-release-frozen-foreign-aid/articleshow/118748206.cms,"A divided US Supreme Court on Wednesday reinstated a lower court's order directing the Donald Trump administration to release nearly $2 billion in frozen foreign aid . However, it remains unclear how soon the funds will be disbursed.In a 5-4 ruling, the court rejected an emergency appeal from the Republican administration but also instructed US District Judge Amir Ali to clarify his initial directive for a swift release of the funds. The decision marks a setback for President Donald Trump, but nonprofit groups and businesses that sued for the money they are owed continue to await payment.Due to the funding freeze, organisations in the US and abroad have reduced services and laid off thousands of workers. HIAS, one of the nonprofits involved in the lawsuit, welcomed the ruling but lamented the damage already done. ""The irreparable damage that the Trump administration has already inflicted on our staff, the people we serve, and the reputation of the United States as a leader and a reliable partner,"" the Maryland-based refugee assistance organisation stated.Justice Samuel Alito led the four dissenting conservative justices, arguing that Ali overstepped his authority in ordering the payments. Alito criticised the ruling, calling it “an act of judicial hubris” that places a “$2 billion penalty on American taxpayers.”Ali’s restraining order, which halted the spending freeze, remains in effect as he prepares for a Thursday hearing on potentially extending the measure. The court's majority noted that the administration had not contested Ali’s original order—only the deadline, which had already lapsed. The justices asked Ali to specify what steps the government must take to comply, considering the feasibility of the timeline.Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, both conservatives, joined the three liberal justices to form the majority. The dissenting justices included Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Alito.The Trump administration has justified its funding freeze by arguing that conditions have changed. Instead of a blanket halt, it has implemented case-by-case reviews, leading to the cancellation of 5,800 contracts from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and 4,100 State Department grants, cutting nearly $60 billion in aid.Trump initially ordered the freeze through an executive directive targeting what he described as wasteful foreign programs that did not align with his administration’s policy goals. However, the lawsuit against the government claimed that halting aid violated federal law and disrupted critical life-saving programs worldwide.Ali first ordered a temporary restoration of the funding on February 13. Nearly two weeks later, he found that the government had not taken any steps to comply and imposed a deadline for releasing payments on work already completed. The administration appealed, calling Ali’s order “incredibly intrusive and profoundly erroneous.”On Wednesday, during a closed-door House Foreign Affairs Committee briefing, Pete Marocco, the Trump political appointee overseeing the USAID cuts , expressed “concerns” about the Supreme Court ruling. Committee Chairman Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, later told reporters that when asked if he would comply with the ruling, Marocco avoided giving a direct response.",A divided US Supreme Court on Wednesday reinstated a lower court's order directing the Donald Trump administration to release nearly $2 billion in frozen foreign aid.

In an ongoing legal battle over President Donald Trump 's authority to dismiss the special counsel, a federal appeals court has ruled in favour of the Trump administration, allowing the immediate removal of Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel .The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with the Trump administration, overturning a previous ruling that reinstated Dellinger. The decision is expected to be appealed.A federal judge in Washington had earlier blocked Trump’s attempt to remove Dellinger, stating that the dismissal was unlawful. Dellinger had sued last month after being fired, arguing that special counsels can only be removed by the president “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Judge Amy Berman Jackson, appointed by President Barack Obama, had temporarily reinstated him while the case proceeded.The ruling comes as another federal judge has blocked the Trump administration’s broader efforts to fire federal employees en masse. In a separate case, a judge in San Francisco ruled that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) lacked the authority to direct mass terminations of probationary federal employees.US District Judge William Alsup ordered the government to reverse layoffs, criticising OPM for overstepping its authority. ""The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe to hire and fire employees at another agency,"" Alsup said, according to The Washington Post.The decision deals a blow to Trump and Elon Musk’s efforts to downsize the federal workforce. Musk, through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, has pushed for drastic reductions, including performance reviews that critics argue amount to forced layoffs.Despite the court ruling, uncertainty remains over whether dismissed employees will be reinstated or if future layoffs will be blocked.

NYPD called in to clear protesters at Barnard College

A fake bomb threat at Barnard College on Wednesday night forced an evacuation as anti-Israel protesters occupied the Milstein Center for the second consecutive week. Over 200 demonstrators refused to leave as more than 50 NYPD officers in riot gear arrived to clear the area.The protest was part of ongoing demonstrations demanding the reinstatement of two students expelled for disrupting a class on modern Israel by throwing antisemitic flyers. Protesters hung an old west-style “Wanted” poster featuring Dean of Students Leslie Grinage, accusing her of expelling pro-Palestinian students. A crude effigy of Barnard President Laura Rosenbury was also placed on the building’s entrance.According to New York Post, as police attempted to disperse the crowd, students started chanting slogans like “NYPD, KKK, they are all the same.” The NYPD eventually removed protesters from the courtyard, but many continued to demonstrate on the campus lawn, shouting, “No justice, no peace.”Despite multiple warnings, some students refused to leave, leading to several arrests. Shortly before 8 p.m., the NYPD announced that the bomb threat had been investigated and cleared.Barnard College had sent an email earlier condemning the disruptions. “Our academic mission is at the heart of what we do, and disruptions to that mission cannot be tolerated,” the statement read. The school did not provide further comments about the bomb threat.","Anti-Israel protesters occupied the Milstein Center for the second consecutive week.

President Donald Trump issued a ""last warning"" to Hamas on Wednesday, demanding the immediate release of all hostages still held in Gaza.In a post on X, Trump described the situation as urgent, saying that Hamas should not delay the release of the hostages or the bodies of those killed. He condemned their actions, calling them ""sick and twisted"" for holding on to the bodies of victims.""To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are dead! Make a smart decision. Release the hostages now, or there will be hell to pay later!

""I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,"" he wrote.His remarks followed confirmation from the White House that US officials had engaged in direct talks with Hamas representatives, breaking with the long-standing US policy of not negotiating with the group.

Here are the designated survivors from recent years:



2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona

2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh

2021: No designated survivor due to limited attendance amid COVID-19

2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt

2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress , White House sources confirmed shortly before the speech on Tuesday night.The tradition of appointing a designated survivor ensures continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic incident during the address, which is attended by the president, vice president, and the full line of succession. Collins, a former representative from Georgia, was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4 and is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain at a secure, undisclosed location during the address. This precaution ensures that a government leader remains available to take charge if an emergency incapacitates those in attendance.While the US Constitution establishes the line of succession, the modern order was set by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Vice President JD Vance is first in line, followed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The list continues through other cabinet members, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem being 18th.Since nearly all these officials attend the joint session, a designated survivor is selected to stay away.The practice of appointing a designated survivor is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, though it was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was given the role.The selection process remains classified, but the individual must meet presidential eligibility criteria: being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some past cabinet members, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the USFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, designated in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, recalled her experience, saying, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Past designated survivors have shared their experiences, revealing they are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the ""nuclear football.""Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was chosen in 2000, described his experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills.”Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who was designated in the 1990s, recalled in a 2017 Politico essay that he was taken to a secure location outside Washington. He wrote, “I don’t recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened… All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.”Shalala, who remained in Washington during her time as designated survivor, recalled waiting at the White House and ordering pizza for her staff. “I saw the president when he left and when he came back,” she said. “He said, ‘Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.’”Typically, cabinet members from various departments have been selected for the role, though Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury have never been chosen.With Collins now assuming the role for 2025, the longstanding tradition continues as the Trump administration ensures the government's continuity during this high-profile address.","Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress.

Dressing for the moment: Melania’s fashion strategy

A stark contrast to Zelensky’s casual rebellion

In a world where every outfit is scrutinized for hidden messages, Melania Trump proved once again that fashion is power. As US President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress, all eyes weren’t just on him—but on the First Lady’s commanding presence in Dior.While political observers dissect Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s choice to ditch a suit at the White House, Melania sent an entirely different message—power, precision, and polish.Clad in a Dior gray wool tweed suit, she exuded quiet authority, her look a stark contrast to the traditional dark suits worn by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.The tailored ensemble—a $5,500 Dior blazer with a removable scarf detail, paired with a matching skirt and a sleek black belt—was a masterclass in sartorial diplomacy. While Melania often champions European fashion houses, Dior remains her trusted go-to for high-profile political moments.""First Lady Melania's style tonight is quiet authority—polished, self-assured, and entirely in command of her presence,"" noted Lauren A Rothman, a style strategist and image coach.This isn’t the first time Melania has used fashion to make a statement. Whether it was her structured three-piece Ralph Lauren suit during a visit to Capitol Hill to support the 'Take It Down Act' or her silk-wool Adam Lippes coat and skirt for Trump’s 2025 inauguration, Melania’s wardrobe is as strategic as it is striking.Her ability to blend American and European fashion houses underscores a carefully curated image—one that commands respect without uttering a word.Melania’s ultra-polished aesthetic stands in stark contrast to Zelensky’s deliberate informality. The Ukrainian president’s refusal to wear a suit at the White House has fueled a heated debate about the role of clothing in global politics. While some see his casual attire as a symbol of wartime resilience, others argue it was a breach of diplomatic decorum.Melania, however, is playing an entirely different game. She doesn’t just dress for the moment—she owns it. And as history has shown, in the high-stakes world of political fashion , perception is everything.","Melania Trump wore a $5,500 Dior gray wool tweed suit to a joint session of Congress.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders. Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe. So proud of the men and women of the FBI, DOJ, and CIA. Justice for Abby Gate- terrorist Jafar officially in US custody,"" he said in a post on X.(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah, a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan.

Why Donald Trump called Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren ‘Pocahontas’ during US Congress address,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-donald-trump-called-massachusetts-senator-elizabeth-warren-pocahontas-during-congress-address/articleshow/118729423.cms,"Trump defends tariffs, attacks DEI and ""woke"" policies in speech to joint session of Congress | FULL

US President Donald Trump On Tuesday reignited a long-standing political feud with Senator Elizabeth Warren , referring to her as ""Pocahontas"" during his address to a joint session of Congress.The remark came as Trump discussed US financial support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia.""The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense... You wanna keep it going for another five years? Yeah. Pocahontas says yes,"" Trump said, seemingly pointing at Warren in the audience. The Massachusetts senator responded with a slow clap and a restrained smile, appearing to keep her composure.Trump has frequently used the ""Pocahontas"" nickname to mock Warren’s past claims of Native American ancestry . The controversy dates back to Warren’s assertion that she had Indigenous heritage—claims that came under scrutiny when she released a 2018 DNA test showing a small percentage of Native ancestry. Critics, including Trump, accused her of exaggerating her background for personal or political gain.Warren later dismissed Trump’s remarks, criticising his speech as “a fantasy.” When asked whether she was surprised by the attack, she simply shook her head. “No,” she said. “The whole speech was a fantasy that Donald Trump tries to construct.”Donald Trump’s comments on Warren came as he defended his stance on the Ukraine conflict , claiming he had been working “tirelessly” to end the war. “Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end in sight,” he said, arguing that US spending on Ukraine’s defense had exceeded $350 billion.The ""Pocahontas"" remark drew criticism from Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin , who called it “low-rent” and unpresidential. “That’s kind of a low-rent thing you don’t expect from a president of the United States,” Durbin said.Donald Trump’s first Congress address of his second term followed a turbulent first six weeks in office, during which he has reshaped US foreign policy, engaged in a trade war with key allies, and clashed with world leaders, including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy.","US President Donald Trump referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as ""Pocahontas"" during his address to a joint session of Congress.

Barnard College Bomb Threat: Police responding to bomb threat clear pro-Palestinian protesters occupying Barnard College library,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/police-responding-to-bomb-threat-clear-pro-palestinian-protesters-occupying-barnard-college-library/articleshow/118746993.cms,"NEW YORK: Barnard College's library was evacuated Wednesday as police responded to a fake bomb threat during a sit-in staged by pro-Palestinian protesters.The New York Police Department said on X, formerly Twitter, that the threat was reported at the upper Manhattan college's Milstein Center, which serves as the hub for academic life on campus. The department said anyone refusing to leave during the evacuation would be subject to arrest.At about 8 p.m., police announced on X that the incident was ""investigated and cleared"" and there was no threat to the public. A spokesperson said later that roughly nine individuals were taken into custody following the demonstration, though it was not immediately clear what charges they faced.Videos shared widely on social media showed protesters inside the building earlier Wednesday afternoon chanting, playing drums and hanging Palestinian flags on walls. Most wore kaffiyeh scarves and other coverings obscuring their faces.Videos from Wednesday evening showed police entering the building wearing helmets and carrying zip ties and then later clearing and detaining protesters and others from the lawn outside the building.College spokespersons and a student group that had coordinated the protest didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Barnard President Laura Rosenbury denounced the protest earlier Wednesday.""Our academic mission is at the heart of what we do, and disruptions to that mission are an affront to the purpose of higher education and cannot be tolerated,"" she wrote in a message sent to the campus community. ""We must not allow the actions of a few interfere with our mission. Campus activities outside of Milstein and throughout the rest of the campus are proceeding as normal.""The group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said on X that students launched their sit-in around 1 p.m. Wednesday in the Milstein library lobby in response to the expulsions of student protesters and other recent actions taken by school officials.""Despite Barnard militarizing campus and inviting NYPD to patrol our academic buildings, we have successfully relaunched our sit-in against the expulsions,"" the student group said on Instagram as they called for school officials to reinstate the expelled students.Last week, pro-Palestinian protesters wearing keffiyeh scarves and masks pushed their way into the college's Milbank Hall, which houses the offices of the dean, and assaulted a school employee, according to school officials.Protest organizers said they dispersed after the administration agreed to meet with them over their demands, which included amnesty for all students disciplined for pro-Palestinian action.","Protest organizers say they dispersed after the administration agreed to meet with them.

"‘Stop acting like a reality TV star’: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett blasts Trump over Russia ties, tariff threats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stop-acting-like-a-reality-tv-star-texas-rep-jasmine-crockett-blasts-trump-over-russia-ties-tariff-threats/articleshow/118746669.cms,"Texas Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett took a sharp jab at President Donald Trump on Tuesday, accusing him of being subservient to Russian President Vladimir Putin . Speaking in an interview with attorney Joe Gallina, Crockett did not hold back when asked what she would say to Trump.“I would tell him to grow a spine and stop being Putin’s ho,” she said, referring to Trump’s stance on Russia.She went on to criticise Trump’s foreign policy approach, particularly his handling of diplomatic relations with key allies. “That’s all we got right now, is Putin’s little ho that is out here really doing the bidding of Russia in a way we’ve never seen an American president do,” Crockett added.Her comments came after a controversial meeting between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Vice President JD Vance at the White House last Friday. The discussion reportedly turned into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vance facing backlash for what critics described as a betrayal of Ukraine . Trump allies, on the other hand, accused Zelenskyy of disrespecting the US.Crockett linked Trump’s handling of the Ukraine issue to his broader foreign policy, also slamming his recent tariff threats against Mexico and Canada. “Diplomacy doesn’t look like s—ting on our allies by telling them we’re going to impose tariffs to the north and the south of us,” she said.Warning about the economic consequences of such moves, she argued that tariffs on Canada and Mexico could drive up the cost of essential goods for Americans. “Because so much lumber and steel come from Canada, Americans will see housing costs go through the roof,” she said, adding that grocery prices would also rise due to increased tariffs on Mexican produce.Despite this, Crockett acknowledged that she could not fault Canada and Mexico for their expected retaliatory measures. Instead, she urged Trump to work with allies rather than alienate them. “As people are still complaining about their eggs, now they’re going to have to worry about the rest of their groceries,” she said.Crockett further criticised Trump’s leadership style, likening it to a reality television show. “Listen, it is time for him to grow a pair and start to do the work of an American president and stop pretending that he is on some terrible reality TV show that is looking for ratings,” she said. “I am hoping that America turns off the TV today, and tunes into people like you, because all he does is look for ratings and we shouldn’t give them the attention.”The Texas lawmaker, known for her outspoken nature, has gained a growing profile in recent years, frequently making headlines for her blunt remarks. Last week, she made waves again when asked by Gallina what she would say to billionaire Elon Musk. Her response: “F— off.”","Texas Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett took a sharp jab at President Donald Trump on Tuesday.

Divided Supreme Court rejects Trump bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/divided-supreme-court-rejects-trump-bid-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-in-foreign-aid/articleshow/118746696.cms,"WASHINGTON: A sharply divided Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the Trump administration 's bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, but it was not clear how quickly money might start flowing.By a 5-4 vote, the court rejected an emergency appeal from the Republican administration, while also telling U.S. District Judge Amir Ali to clarify his earlier order that required the quick release of nearly $2 billion in aid for work that had already been done.It was the second time the new administration had sought and failed to persuade the conservative-led court with three appointees of President Donald Trump to rein in a federal judge who put the brakes on executive action taken by Trump.Although the outcome is a short-term loss for the administration, the nonprofit groups and businesses that sued are still waiting for the money they say they are owed. Organizations in the U.S. and around the world have cut services and laid off thousands of workers as a result.HIAS, one of the nonprofit groups in the case, said it was encouraged to see the Trump administration held accountable, but said it regretted ""the irreparable damage that the Trump administration has already inflicted on our staff, the people we serve, and the reputation of the United States as a leader and a reliable partner.""The Maryland-based group has worked on refugee issues for more than a century, including giving potential refugees support to stay in their home countries.Justice Samuel Alito led four conservative justices in dissent, saying Ali lacks the authority to order the payments. Alito wrote that he is stunned the court is rewarding ""an act of judicial hubris and imposes a $2 billion penalty on American taxpayers.""The court's action leaves in place Ali's temporary restraining order that had paused the spending freeze. Ali is holding a hearing Thursday to consider a more lasting pause.The majority noted that the administration had not challenged Ali's initial order, only the deadline, which in any event passed last week.The court told Ali to ""clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.""Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, two conservatives, joined the three liberal justices to form a majority.Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined Alito's dissent.The Trump administration has argued that the situation has changed because it has replaced a blanket spending freeze with individualized determinations that led to the cancellation of 5,800 U.S. Agency for International Development contracts and another 4,100 State Department grants totaling nearly $60 billion in aid.The federal government froze foreign aid after an executive order from Trump targeting what he called wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals.The lawsuit that followed claimed that the pause breaks federal law and has shut down funding for even the most urgent life-saving programs abroad.Ali ordered the funding temporarily restored on Feb. 13, but nearly two weeks later he found the government was giving no sign of complying and set a deadline to release payment for work already completed.The administration appealed, calling Ali's order ""incredibly intrusive and profoundly erroneous"" and protesting the timeline to release the money.Pete Marocco, the Trump political appointee overseeing the dismantling of USAID, detailed ""concerns"" he had about the Supreme Court ruling to lawmakers Wednesday during an already scheduled closed-door briefing to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Committee Chairman Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, described the exchange to reporters afterward. Mast and Democrats on the panel said that Marocco did not directly answer when asked by Democrats if he would obey the Supreme Court ruling on the funding freeze.",The Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from the Republican administration. The court told a judge to clarify his earlier order that required the quick release of nearly $2 billion in aid for work that had already been done.

CIA director says US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-director-says-us-has-paused-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine/articleshow/118746690.cms,"Ukrainian soldiers with the 148th Separate Artillery Zhytomyr Brigade of Air Assault forces on the front line near Kurakhove on Feb. 14, 2025. (NYT)

WASHINGTON: CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that intelligence sharing with Ukraine had been paused alongside military aid to pressure its government to cooperate with the Trump administration 's plans to end the country's war with Russia.Speaking on Fox Business, Ratcliffe applauded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 's statement Tuesday praising President Donald Trump and insisting that he supported peace with Russia. Ratcliffe said he thought intelligence sharing would resume.""President Zelenskyy put out a statement that said, 'I am ready for peace, and I want President Donald Trump's leadership to bring about that peace,'"" Ratcliffe said. ""And so I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away, and I think we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have, to push back on the aggression that's there.""His remarks were echoed by Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, who told reporters at the White House that the United States had ""taken a step back"" and was ""pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship.""A U.S. official said the pause stopped all military targeting information from being shared with Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official said the pause in sharing would make strikes on Russian forces more difficult, but Ukraine's military had access to other satellite imagery.The pause also affected some intelligence about advance warning of drone and missile strikes that Russia has been carrying out against military and civilian targets, according to a person briefed on the pause.""Everything that came from the Defense Department has stopped,"" said Valeriy Kondratiuk, the former head of HUR, one of Ukraine's intelligence services. ""This mostly concerns the exchange of imagery. This isn't critical because European companies have their own satellites, but not all these are focused on military dislocation and movements, which is important.""The CIA has a sizable presence in the country, where it was working alongside the Ukrainians to help with targeting.Some of the officers have been deployed to Ukrainian bases, where they review lists of potential Russian targets that the Ukrainians are preparing to strike, comparing the information that the Ukrainians have with U.S. intelligence to ensure that it is accurate.The CIA has also helped the Ukrainians build at least three secret signals-intelligence collection bases, which the Ukrainians use to intercept Russian communications, reducing their dependence on the United States for intelligence.Some U.S. officials said the hope was that any pause in intelligence sharing would be very short, with little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official said the initial plan was to pause military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of the campaign to pressure Zelenskyy.It was not clear whether the Ukrainian president's statement Tuesday would be enough to restart the aid. While Trump praised it and Zelenskyy in his address to Congress that evening, some Trump administration officials want the Ukrainian president to remove officials from his government whom the White House sees as hostile to negotiations with the Russians. The Trump administration also wants Zelenskyy to sign a deal giving the United States access to mineral rights in Ukraine.While the Trump administration has steadily increased pressure on Ukraine, it has not done so to Russia to halt its attacks. The Russian military has continued to bombard Ukrainian cities daily.Ratcliffe said Wednesday that Trump had asked for a pause on intelligence sharing. And his comments suggested that the CIA had put at least some of its intelligence sharing with Ukraine on hold for a short time. Waltz said he had spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart and predicted ""movement in very short order.""Speaking earlier on Fox News, Waltz said if Ukraine signaled that it was ready to negotiate a ceasefire, the pause would be lifted.""I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move toward these negotiations and, in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,"" Waltz said.Democrats attacked the decision to pause the intelligence assistance. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine had saved lives of civilians and soldiers.""The pause on providing matériel to Ukraine against Putin's aggression is unconscionable on its own, but the idea that we will now withhold lifesaving intelligence from Ukrainians who are fighting and dying is unforgivable,"" Himes said. ""Any pause in intelligence sharing must end immediately.""Trump administration officials have said the pauses were a warning to the Ukrainians of the consequences if they did not cooperate with Trump's peace plan. The details of those plans remain unclear. Trump has spoken approvingly of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and his aides have endorsed elements of the country's ideas for ending the war.But European countries are trying to develop their own plan that could win over both Trump and Zelenskyy.In a statement Wednesday, U.S. European Command said it had received an order to pause security assistance to the Ukrainian military.A spokesperson for the command said delivery of military equipment that had been promised as part of Presidential Drawdown Authority packages would be suspended. Matériel in transit was halted, and matériel already in Ukraine was moved to secure facilities, the statement said.","CIA Director John Ratcliffe says the U.S. is ""pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship"" Ratcliffe: ""We'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have, to push back on the aggression that's there"" A senior Ukrainian official said the pause in sharing would make strikes on Russian forces more difficult.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118746725,imgsize-1057815,width-400,resizemode-4/118746725.jpg"

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning a large-scale restructuring, which includes cutting more than 80,000 jobs, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press.The plan, set for implementation in August, aims to bring the agency’s workforce back to 2019 levels.Christopher Syrek, the VA’s chief of staff, instructed agency officials to prepare for the changes, saying that the reorganisation will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.”The initiative is part of a broader government downsizing effort led by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk.Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins defended the move and said, “This administration is finally going to give veterans what they want. President Trump has a mandate for generational change in Washington, and that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver at the VA.” He assured that the cuts would not impact healthcare or benefits, but many veterans remain skeptical.The VA, which serves over 9 million veterans, has been growing in recent years due to expansions under the Biden administration and the 2022 PACT Act, which provides healthcare to those affected by toxic burn pits.The plan has sparked strong reactions in Congress. Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over the lack of communication from the VA, with Senator Lindsey Graham calling it “political malpractice not to consult Congress.” Democratic leaders, including Senator Richard Blumenthal , have condemned the move as a betrayal of veterans, arguing that it prioritises cost-cutting over essential services.","Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning a large-scale restructuring, which includes cutting more than 80,000 jobs.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

Trump's Rare Praise For Pakistan; Big Reveal On Killing Of 13 US Troops In 2021 Kabul Attack

US President Donald Trump in his first address to Congress mentioned Pakistan's cooperation in arresting Mohammad Shareefullah , a key terrorist involved in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took note of the mention and thanked Trump for ""acknowledging and appreciating"" Pakistan's role in Shareefullah's arrest.""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region, in the context of Pakistan Security Forces' recent apprehension of ISKP's top tier operational commander Shareefullah, who is an Afghanistan national,"" Sharif said.The attack on the Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) on August 26, 2021, took place when American and other Coalition military forces were conducting an evacuation operation at the airport as part of a larger operation to conclude US combat operations in Afghanistan.Sharif added the ""wanted terrorist was apprehended in a successful operation conducted in the Pakistan-Afghan border region"".""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter-terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups or the space to operate against any other country,"" Sharif said.The prime minister said Pakistan ""will continue to partner closely with the US in securing regional peace and stability"".""We remain steadfast in our resolve and unwavering commitment to combating terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations. In this effort, Pakistan has rendered great sacrifices, including the lives of over 80,000 of our brave soldiers and citizens,"" he said.""The resolve of our leadership and our people remains unflinching in eradicating the menace of terrorism from our country. We will continue to partner closely with the US in securing regional peace and stability.""Donald Trump in his address announced that the US apprehended the top terrorist ( Mohammad Shareefullah) who was responsible for the Kabul airport attack. ""I want to thank, especially, the Pakistani government for helping arrest this monster,"" Trump said. ""This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, whom I actually got to know very well, whose children were murdered. What a horrible day,"" Trump said.The special mention of Pakistan came after the administration recently authorised $397 million for Pakistan for its F-16 fighter jet fleet -- signalling a possible shift in policy. In 2018, during his previous term, Trump halted military assistance to Pakistan citing their inadequate counter-terrorism efforts.","US President Donald Trump in his first address to Congress mentioned Pakistan's cooperation in arresting Mohammad Shareefullah, a key terrorist involved in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.

Suicide blast kills 5 in Pakistan madrasa known as ‘university of jihad’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/suicide-blast-kills-5-in-pakistan-madrasa-known-as-university-of-jihad/articleshow/118637211.cms,"Pakistan blast

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.
