BIJAPUR: CRPF DG G P Singh on Wednesday said Operation Blackforest — which demolished a Maoist ‘bastion’ in Karregutalu Hills (KGH) on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border — saw the force try out cave interventions for the first time, for the hills housed a network of 250 cave formations used by the Maoists as convenient hideouts, arms manufacturing units and to dump explosives and rations.“CRPF has generally been doing house or vehicle interventions. For the first time, we tried cave interventions. We had use a technique and make sure that we do not suffer casualties but neutralise the Maoists who may be there,” he told a press conference here.Singh said the forces also learnt that Naxals are now using beer bottles to make IEDs, which involve the minimum use of metal. “This now requires ingenuity in detecting IEDs and we will be revising our SOPs accordingly,” he said.Around 450 IEDs were detected and deactivated, though 15 IEDs that went off caused some injuries to force personnel. Singh said the force has been upgrading its IED detection equipment and technology to whatever is the latest available in the world.The CRPF chief said the recovery of a whopping 818 barrel grande launcher shells (BGLs) and 450 IEDs during the operation is significant as most of the Maoist attacks on security camps so far were done using BGLs. “Also, most of our personnel out on operations are killed or injured by IEDs,” said Singh.",Operation Blackforest demolished a Maoist ‘bastion’ in Karregutalu Hills (KGH) on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border.

'New normal' for Congress? Shashi Tharoor's praise for PM Modi's policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-normal-for-congress-shashi-tharoors-praise-for-pm-modis-policies/articleshow/121167193.cms,"Poll Do you believe that India's approach to conflict with Pakistan has changed under Modi's government? No, it's consistent with previous policies. Yes, it's more aggressive.

NEW DELHI: Has Shashi Tharoor set a ""new normal"" for the Congress post India's "" Operation Sindoor ""? Well, it seems so. The Thiruvananthapuram MP has been unequivocal and unwavering in his praise of the steps taken by the Narendra Modi government against Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack . So much so, the BJP leaders have cited Tharoor's strong defence of the government to school and shame the opposition, including the Congress.While the Congress has heaped praise on the armed forces over the success of ""Operation Sindoor"", it has questioned the Modi government's decision to announce sudden ceasefire, which, ironically, was first announced by US President Donald Trump . While making the ceasefire announcement, Trump also claimed that India and Pakistan had agreed to talks at a neutral venue. Later, Trump went on to claim, not once but twice, that he used trade deal as a leverage to force India and Pakistan to agree to the ceasefire. While India did not react to Trump's claim publically, the external affairs ministry made it clear that trade was never a part of any discussions with the US. India also categorically declared that it was Islamabad that had approached us for ceasefire after the May 10 strike by our armed forces which destroyed many air bases in Pakistan.The Congress raised tough questions for Prime Minister Modi in the light of these US claims. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said: ""The Prime Minister did not speak one word on the claims made by President Trump minutes before his address to the nation. Has India accepted America's mediation? Has India agreed to hold talks with Pakistan at a neutral venue? Will India now accept US demand for opening of markets in automobile, agriculture and other sectors?"" Other opposition leaders also targeted the government over US claims of playing the mediator.However, Shashi Tharoor strongly defended the Modi government and called the US President ""a politician wanting to take credit for something."" Tharoor also justified India's decision to agree to a ceasefire.""Peace is essential. I am very glad, India never wanted a long-term war. India wanted to teach terrorists a lesson, I believe that lesson has been taught. The other details are awaited,"" Tharoor said in his first recation on ceasefire.For US President Trump's claims, Tharoor had a sharp retort.""I see it as a particular politician wanting to take credit for something and I can see that the government of India probably said 'let them take the credit if they want to', but from our point of view we have made it clear that the peace followed a request from the DGMO of Pakistan who called his Indian counterpart at 3:35 pm (Saturday) and we did not take very long to say yes because we had never wanted a long war,"" Tharoor said.Clarifying that he was speaking as an individual MP, Tharoor said he did not like Trump's social media posts on the issue.""You are making equivalent the victim and the perpetrator, which is really shocking. It is completely wrong to imply that as a result of this India is going to give some sort of negotiation to Pakistan. We will never negotiate to the point of a gun, we are never going to give the satisfaction to Pakistan of feeling that by unleashing a terrorist attack in Pahalgam they have somehow earned the right to negotiate with India,"" he said.""I don't think that Mr Trump should have in any way, shape or form implied that the Kashmiri dispute has been internationalised by the American involvement. We don't even accept that there is a dispute of that nature, Kashmir is an integral part of India ... we are not interested at all in internationalising the dispute,"" he added.Earlier also Tharoor was effusive in his praise for ""Operation Sindoor"" and had said: ""The operation was well-calibrated, well-calculated, and effectively executed. I am very impressed, from the naming of the operation to how it was presented to the world. We had to respond. We could not allow Pakistani terrorists to believe that they can walk into our country, kill civilians, and get away with it. They had to be punished. At the same time, an indiscriminate action on our part could have needlessly provoked an escalation and cost us the sympathy of the world.""The Congress MP also praised the government's messaging on the issue: ""We are doing all the right things so far. The nature of Operation Sindoor was right. The messaging of the press conference in which the foreign secretary, a Kashmiri Pandit, was flanked on both sides by women officers, one of whom was a Muslim, demonstrates a narrative against the one of Hindu-Muslim hostility being spread by the Pakistanis like silly general Munir. It sends a very good message.""And when some Congress leaders spoke of 1971 war and the role of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Tharoor had this message for his party leaders.""Today's Pakistan is a different situation. Their military equipment and the damage they can do are different. Bangladesh was fighting a moral cause to actually bring people to freedom and liberation. That was a completely different story. This is a different story. We would have ended up with much longer, protracted conflicts with a lot of loss of lives on both sides. Is this the biggest priority for India today? No, it is not.""While Tharoor heaped praised on Modi government's actions against Pakistan, he did not hesitate to slam the BJP when the safrron party put out a social media post criticising the previous UPA government and said the ""petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable"".Tagging the BJP's post on X, Tharoor said, ""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India. Jai Hind.""Tharoor, a leading opposition leader, gave the BJP enough ammunition to target the critics of the government and accuse the Congress of playing politics.""I am really surprised that Congress is not listening to what Shashi Tharoor is saying. He is a senior Congress leader and is very clear that let anybody take the credit, but India decided to have this understanding with Pakistan. We didn't want a war. It was an understanding based on our terms and conditions. But you (Congress) want to politicise everything,"" Tamil Nadu BJP vice president Narayanan Thirupathy said slamming the grand-old-party.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the Congress over his repeated praise for PM Modi and his policies.When Tharoor had first praised Prime Minister Modi for his US visit and then lauded India's role under the PM in the Russia-Ukraine war, the Congress had reacted very sharply to his remarks.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had then laid stress on discipline and had given a stern warning to the state leaders that strong action will be taken against those making comments that go against the party's interests.The Congress has officially not reacted to Tharoor's statements but Jairam Ramesh has made it clear that ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it does not reflect the views of the party."" Party sources say that Tharoor has crossed the 'lakshman rekha' with his repeated comments on the India-Pakistan conflict.(With inputs from agencies)","The Congress has heaped praise on the armed forces over the success of ""Operation Sindoor"" It has questioned the Modi government's decision to announce sudden ceasefire, which, ironically, was first announced by US President Donald Trump.

IAEA says no report of radiation leak from any Pak facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaea-says-no-report-of-radiation-leak-from-any-pak-facility/articleshow/121171115.cms,"Representative photo

DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor , triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA’s press department in an email response to TOI’s query stated, “We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.”The development came two days after Indian Air Force’s director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, “Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn’t know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.”The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, “Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan’s National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied. In fact, Pakistan’s govt representatives have officially denied this on record.”IAEA’s statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless.",IAEA rejects widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor.

US defence strategist hails India’s ‘decisive victory’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-defence-strategist-hails-indias-decisive-victory/articleshow/121171502.cms,"US def strategist hails India’s ‘decisive victory’, says response showed clarity

NEW DELHI: John Spencer , a military strategist who is also an urban warfare expert, has weighed in the debate on the extent of the success of ‘Operation Sindoor’, asserting that India scored a decisive victory .“After just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory. Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims — destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine . This was not a symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,” Spencer wrote in his latest blog.Spencer currently serves as the chair of the Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute at West Point (US Military Academy), New York, and has been a part of the strategic research group at Pentagon.“India has not declared Operation Sindoor completely over. What exists now is a sensitive halt in operations — some may call it a ceasefire, but military leaders have deliberately avoided that word. From a war-fighting perspective, this is not merely a pause; it is a strategic hold following a rare and unambiguous military victory,” he says.Spencer said Operation Sindoor was “more than a retaliation, this was the unveiling of a strategic doctrine”, quoting PM Narendra Modi as saying, “terror and talks can’t go together. Water and blood can’t flow together”.He said that India’s military response to terror attacks is “overwhelming yet controlled — precise, decisive, and without hesitation. That kind of clarity is rare in modern war. In an era defined by ‘forever wars’ and cycles of violence without strategic direction, Operation Sindoor stands apart. It offers a model of limited war with clearly defined ends, matched ways and means, and a state that never relinquished the initiative”.“In an age where many modern wars spiral into open-ended occupations or political confusion, Operation Sindoor stands apart. This was a demonstration of disciplined military strategy: clear goals, aligned ways and means, and adaptive execution in the face of unpredictable escalation. India absorbed a blow, defined its objective, and achieved it — all within a contained timeframe,” he added.The controlled escalation, he said, sent a clear deterrent signal: India will respond, and it controls the pace. “India’s restraint is not weakness — it is maturity. It imposed costs, redefined thresholds, and retained escalation dominance. India didn’t just respond to an attack. It changed the strategic equation,” he adds.Spencer noted the fact that India handled this crisis without seeking international mediation, enforced its doctrine on sovereign terms, using sovereign means.","US military strategist hails India’s ‘decisive victory’, says response showed clarity.

"Tech glitches disrupt CUET-UG day-2 in conflict-hit J&K, Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tech-glitches-disrupt-cuet-ug-day-2-in-conflict-hit-jk-delhi/articleshow/121171656.cms,"NTA likely to postpone CUET-UG 2025 examination: Sources

NEW DELHI: The second day of CUET-UG, 2025 witnessed continued disruptions, as technical failures at exam centres affected more than 350 students across J&K and Delhi. The repeated setbacks have sparked serious concerns about the readiness of infrastructure supporting this critical national-level test. In J&K, the situation was further exacerbated by logistical failures. National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts CUET-UG, confirmed cancellation of exam on May 14 at Kite Polytechnic centre in Srinagar, citing technical malfunctions. The test was also cancelled at the centre on May 13, the first day of the exam. While 76 students were unable to take the test on May 13, dozens more were affected on Wednesday. NTA said fresh dates will be announced and new admit cards will be issued to the affected candidates. However, the agency’s response has done little to address the growing frustration among students and their families in the region.Allocation of CUET-UG exam centres has also sparked widespread concern in Meghalaya, with the state govt accusing NTA of failing to communicate in advance about a shortage of centres within state. This oversight resulted in many students being assigned centres outside Meghalaya — some as far as Jorhat and Dibrugarh in Assam, Mizoram, and Bengal’s Kolkata — causing undue financial and logistical stress. Education minister Rakkam A Sangma urged NTA to defer the exams until additional centres, over 200 of which have already been identified and submitted to TCS for vetting, are made ready.J&K Students Association president Nasir Khuehami said he had received numerous distress calls from students unable to attend the exam. “Many had to flee homes due to the (India-Pakistan) conflict. Some are in different states and have no way to return. Their academic future is at risk,” he said. Several students assigned centres outside the UT described the situation as unmanageable. A resident of Jammu was allotted a centre in Himachal Pradesh. “Travelling during this period was not just unsafe—it was impossible. My whole year’s effort feels wasted,” he lamented.Delhi students faced a different set of obstacles. Candidates at centres such as the one in Rohini reported prolonged delays, power outages, and mismanagement. A students, who reached her centre at 6:30 am, said the gates remained closed well past reporting time, and the exam began nearly 90 minutes late. “There was no electricity, backup failed, and students were left waiting outside in the heat,” she said.Inside the examination centre, students experienced rushed verification, poor ventilation, and inadequate seating arrangements. “One AC for 40 students — barely working,” Panghal recalled.Similar reports came from centres in Ambala in Haryana, where candidates complained of extreme heat, lack of fans, and tight security that forced many to discard personal items due to the absence of lockers."," CUET-UG, 2025 witnessed continued disruptions, as technical failures at exam centres affected more than 350 students across J&K and Delhi.

ROHTAK: A routine attempt to unblock a domestic drain at Majra village in Haryana's Rohtak district turned tragic Wednesday when a retired Army man and two of his sons died inside a clogged sewer manhole. The deceased were Mahabir Singh and his sons Lakshman and Deepak.According to Mahabir's wife, Santosh Devi, a household drain had been backing up for days. Lakshman, who worked at a motorcycle-repair shop, lifted the manhole cover outside the house to investigate and slipped in. Mahabir immediately descended to rescue him but failed to re-emerge. Deepak, employed at a private firm in Rohtak, then entered the sewer in a final effort to save both, but all three succumbed, apparently to toxic gases.DSP Ravi Khundia called the accident ""deeply unfortunate"" & confirmed that postmortems were underway even as no formal complaint had been filed yet.","A routine attempt to unblock a domestic drain at Majra village in Haryana's Rohtak district turned tragic Wednesday.

21-day ‘biggest-ever op’ leaves 31 Maoists dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/21-day-biggest-ever-op-leaves-31-maoists-dead/articleshow/121171477.cms,"Security forces concluded a 21-day anti-Maoist operation in Karreguttalu Hills. Thirty-one Maoist bodies were recovered. The operation scattered the Maoist command. Amit Shah called it the biggest assault on Maoists. Forces faced difficult terrain. They cleared caves housing arms manufacturing units. The operation busted a major Maoist stronghold. Disjointed Maoist formations are taking shelter in different places.

BIJAPUR: A 21-day anti-Maoist operation in Karreguttalu Hills (KGH) on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border — headquarters of the most lethal of CPI(Maoist) wings, the PLGA Battalion No 1 , and housing its arms manufacturing units in the natural cave formations within — culminated on May 11, leaving scores of senior Maoists dead , with 31 bodies recovered, and segregated the Centrally-located Maoist command into 8-10 smaller, dislocated units with a massively depleted arsenal and armed capabilities.Hailing ‘ Operation Blackforest ’ — conducted from April 21 to May 11 by the Chhattisgarh Police’s special task force (STF) and district reserve guard (DRG) as well as CRPF — as “the biggest ever operation against Naxalism”, home minister Amit Shah in a post on X on Wednesday shared that the tricolour now flies proudly “on the hill where red terror once reigned”.“KGH was the unified headquarters of big Naxal organisations like PLGA Battalion 1, DKSZC, TSC & CRC, where along with Naxal training, strategies and weapons were also developed. Our security forces completed this biggest anti-Naxal operation in just 21 days and I am extremely happy that there was not a single casualty among the security forces,” Shah said as he congratulated CRPF, STF and DRG soldiers for facing the Naxalites “with exemplary courage even in adverse weather and treacherous terrain”.Eighteen security personnel injured in the operation are out of danger and recovering. The 28 neutralised Naxalites identified so far include 2 divisional committee members and 11 PLGA battalion fighters; they together carried a reward of Rs 1.72 crore.“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, we are determined to root out Naxalism. I once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026,” said Shah.Addressing a joint press conference here Wednesday, Chhattisgarh DGP Arun Dev Gautam said the forces defied challenging terrain, extreme temperatures and rainstorms, threats from wild animals and a web of landmines laid by the nearly 350 Maoists operating in the area, to reclaim KGH after killing at least 31 Maoists, including 16 women cadres. Around 250 caves running through the hills — which housed 4 arms manufacturing units with leth machines and weapon dumps holding 818 barrel grenade launchers; 35 automatic and semi-automatic weapons, 303 and INSAS rifles; 450 IEDs; cordex wires; besides 216 hideouts and bunkers; and 12,000 kg of food supplies and medicines — were cleared.DG CRPF G P Singh said the operation has busted yet another major Maoist stronghold after Chakrabanda in Bihar and Burapahar in Jharkhand. “The Maoist leadership and senior cadres who were congregated in the KGH hideout have been dislocated and segregated into smaller groups. The disjointed military formations have been forced to take shelter in different places,” he said. A source said this affects the CPI (Maoist) command structure and operational capabilities as the scattered groups cannot congregate for a big operation at short notice; also, it would be easier for the forces to go after them.Though the main objective of the operation was to neutralise top Maoist leaders like Hidma, the difficult topography of the hills made it difficult for the forces to assess the fatalities inflicted. But senior police and paramilitary official agreed that “the Maoists’ weaponry, arms and explosives emptied during the operation will significantly reduce their armed capabilities”.“Their technical units were busted and any attempt now by the scattered groups of Maoists, to reestablish contact will be detected through technical surveillance. Maoists are now possibly taking shelter in disjointed groups across national park area, West Bastar, south Bastar and parts of Telangana. Also, there seems to be some mistrust between the CPI Maoist leadership in Telangana and Chattisgarh. All this has put the Maoists on the backfoot,” said a senior officer.The CRPF DG said the once heavily-mined KGH hills have undergone several rounds of sanitisation, and the residual IEDs will also be de-mined soon. “Once this is done, the hills will be opened up for access by the locals,” he said adding that CRPF will be holding the area by setting up forward operating bases there.Gautam said Operation Blackforest — which displayed excellent coordination between the intelligence agencies, CRPF, Chhattisgarh Police, with Indian Air Force and BSF providing their choppers for airdropping rations and supplies and airlifting personnel and Telangana assisting CRPF on its side of KGH — has busted the Maoists’ belief that the area is their “impregnable” fortress.",Home minister Amit Shah called it the biggest assault on Maoists.

Operation Sindoor: Congress demands answers from Modi govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-cong-demands-answers-from-modi-govt/articleshow/121171406.cms,"Rahul Gandhi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will hold a press conference on Friday to address the issues arising after the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, as the party said the govt needs to answer the questions triggered by US President’s Donald Trump’s announcements on ceasefire that have led to internationalisation of Kashmir and a hyphenation of India and Pakistan. Congress will take out Jai Hind Yatras in cities to counter the BJP’s attempt to “politicise the operation against Pakistan”. The party reiterated the need for accountability on “intelligence failure” in Pahalgam, lamenting that it had not yet been fixed yet.A meeting of the CWC, chaired by Rahul Gandhi, expressed concerns that Prime Minister has chosen to remain silent on the crucial issue of comments from US leaders, which have resulted in hyphenation between India and Pakistan and led to belief that it has a leverage over the country. It said the PM should clarify the issues raised by Trump’s remarks.The gathering decided that Modi govt needed to be put on the mat for its “poorly devised” conclusion of hostilities without any guarantees on terror from Pakistan. Congress reiterated its demand for an all-party meeting chaired by the PM and a special session of Parliament. The party also demanded the resignation of MP minister Vijay Shah for his “appalling” comments on Col Sophiya Qureshi.Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have said that Congress fully backs the actions of the armed forces, but the US seems to have taken India for granted and it is not clear who rushed to America seeking intervention. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that tough questions should be asked of the govt. Crucially, Sachin Pilot is learnt to have noted that Trump and US secretary of state Marco Rubio have not mentioned the word “terror” even once in their tweets and comments, while Kashmir has figured prominently there. The development was dubbed as alarming by many in the meeting which included P Chidambaram, K C Venugopal, Ajay Maken, Shashi Tharoor, Randeep Surjewala, Pawan Khera and Jairam Ramesh among others.According to sources, the leaders felt BJP’s “politicisation of war” should be countered, with Randeep Surjewala suggesting that Congress take out Jai Hind Yatras in cities to challenge the BJP’s Tiranga Yatras. However, there appeared not much worry about BJP seeking to play the war card, with many opining that the ruling party’s rallies are a “face saver” because people were asking questions about the ceasefire brokered by the US, which has given Pakistan an advantage.Jairam Ramesh told reporters that PM calling an exclusive meeting of NDA chief ministers on May 25th, excluding other CMs, is a blatant attempt at politicisation of the operation against Pakistan. He said the PM should have called all the CMs.Interestingly, Shashi Tharoor, who has emerged as a vocal face in media defending India’s actions while also backing the govt, is learnt to have suggested that foreign secretary should be grilled on strategy when he briefs the parliamentary standing committee. Foreign secretaryVikram Misri will meet the panel chaired by Tharoor next week.Some leaders including Pilot are said to have underlined that China has come out openly in support of Pakistan but international support has been missing for India, with even Russia staying mum.The very durability of ceasefire was questioned as Pakistan govt is unstable and the army is calling the shots, sources said.In a resolution, the CWC said the abrupt end to action against Pakistan has raised questions as US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire first and said he used the threat of trade to pressure India. It termed the govt’s silence “inexplicable and unacceptable”. “This represents a dangerous and unprecedented hyphenation of India with Pakistan, which compromises our national position and prestige,” the resolution said.","Congress will take out Jai Hind Yatras in cities to counter the BJP’s attempt to “politicise the operation against Pakistan” The party reiterated the need for accountability on “intelligence failure” in Pahalgam, lamenting that it had not yet been fixed yet.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121171404,imgsize-914329,width-400,resizemode-4/Rahul-Gandhi-Bharat-Summit.jpg"

KOLKATA: At least three police personnel were injured — one of them seriously — after violent clashes broke out at Barasat in Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district late Tuesday, following a viral social media post allegedly expressing support for Pakistan and opposing India.The accused, Nazir Hossain, was arrested for allegedly uploading the post on Facebook.

AMRITSAR/NEW DELHI: A BSF constable held for 22 days in Pakistan after inadvertantly crossing the Punjab border was released Wednesday morning, drawing emotional scenes in his Bengal hometown.Purnam Kumar Shaw , 40, was handed over by Pakistan Rangers to BSF officers at Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar around 10.30am, concluding days of tense diplomatic and military manoeuvring between India and Pakistan amid Operation Sindoor Shaw’s wife Rajni, who is in advanced pregnancy, said: “Every citizen prayed for my sindoor,” thanking PM Narendra Modi and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.Officials said Shaw, part of BSF’s 182 Battalion, was in uniform and carrying his rifle when he crossed into Pakistani territory in Ferozepur on April 23 while on operational duty. “He was received in accordance with established protocols. He appeared safe and healthy,” said Dr Atul Fulzele, IF of BSF’s Punjab frontier. A medical check-up and debriefing followed.Shaw’s crossing came a day after the Pahalgam terrorist strike that claimed 26 men, mostly tourists, and heightened tensions across the border. India responded with precision strikes on terrorist and military targets in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor.Pakistani Rangers had released photos showing Shaw blindfolded and disoriented. BSF initially shared an image of Shaw with a beard, later issuing one where he appeared clean-shaven and in fresh clothes.Efforts to secure his release included multiple flag meetings and diplomatic outreach. Sources said a final meeting between BSF and Pakistani Rangers commandants paved the way for Wednesday’s handover. BSF attributed Shaw’s return to “consistent efforts through communication channels”.In a parallel and unacknowledged move, a Pakistani soldier who had crossed into Rajasthan on May 4 walked back across Wagah the same morning.In Rishra of Bengal’s Hooghly district, Shaw’s family broke down in joy. “We cannot even imagine what he faced, but he will serve the country again,” said his father Bholanath Shaw. His mother Devanti Devi handed out sweets.Shaw’s wife recounted the anxiety that gripped the family. “I ran from pillar to post. I feared war would break out and we’d lose him,” she said. Rajni had even visited BSF officers near the border for updates. CM Banerjee later phoned Rajni and confirmed that talks at DGMO-level had included her husband’s case.After BSF’s press release confirmed his return, Rajni received a brief call from Shaw. “Main bol raha hoon,” he said. Unsure at first, she asked, “Aap PK Sir hain?” before recognising his voice.The couple’s young son Aarav looked up at a kite kept on top of a cupboard. “We flew it during Holi when papa was home. We’ll fly it again together,” he said.","Purnam Kumar Shaw was handed over by Pakistan Rangers to BSF officers at Attari- Wagah border near Amritsar around 10.30am.

Govt rejects another China bid to rename places in Arunachal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-rejects-another-china-bid-to-rename-places-in-arunachal/articleshow/121171040.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Govt has rejected another “preposterous” attempt by China to rename 27 places in Arunachal Pradesh, saying the state is and will always remain an integral part of India. This is the fifth time that China has renamed villages in Arunachal to reinforce its claim over the Indian state it calls ‘Zangnan’.“Consistent with our principled position, we categorically reject such vain and preposterous attempts to rename places in the Indian state. Creative naming will not alter the undeniable reality that Arunachal Pradesh was, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal .China has in the past renamed places in Arunachal Pradesh on four occasions — 2017, 2021, 2023 and 2024 — each of which was preceded by a diplomatic spat with India. For example, the first such exercise in 2017 followed the Dalai Lama’s visit to the state. In 2023, the same attempt followed a G20 meeting that India hosted in the state.On this occasion, it followed last week’s military skirmishes between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The renaming is seen by many as another example of coercive diplomacy that Beijing is known to practise to validate its territorial claims .The Chinese foreign ministry later doubled down saying, “The Zangnan region belongs to China. The Chinese govt’s recent effort to standardise the names of some of the places in Zangnan is fully within China’s sovereignty.”China claims not just Tawang in Arunachal but effectively the entire state saying it’s a part of south Tibet. While the Tibetan govt-in-exile says Arunachal Pradesh is a part of India, China maintains it’s in south Tibet and cites examples like the second most important Tibetan Buddhism monastery being in Tawang and the sixth Dalai Lama being born there to back its claim.","This is the fifth time that China has renamed villages in Arunachal to reinforce its claim over the Indian state it calls ‘Zangnan’ The renaming is seen by many as another example of coercive diplomacy that Beijing is known to practise to validate its territorial claims.

KOLKATA: A little after noon, Rajni's phone rang. ""Main bol raha hun (It's me),"" said a heavy, hoarse voice. Unable to recognise the caller, Rajni tentatively asked, ""Aap PK Sir hain (Are you PK Sir)?""""I couldn't believe it was him. We don't take our husbands' names. I called him PK Sir to confirm it was indeed him,"" said the happy wife. It was a brief call and Purnam asked about his parents and spoke to his son Aarav.For the next few hours, an overjoyed Devanti Devi, Purnam's elderly mother, stood with boxes of sweets at the door of their house. ""Thora munh meetha kar lijiye (have some sweets),"" she urged everyone she met.

NEW DELHI: Security forces on Wednesday seized a massive cache of weapons and ammunition, including rifles, bullets and grenades in J&K's Shopian, a day after three Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists were gunned down in encounter under Operation Keller The recovered arms are believed to have belonged to the trio neutralised on Tuesday during a joint operation by the Army and paramilitary forces in the dense forests of Shoekal Keller.The slain terrorists were linked to Pakistan-backed banned outfit LeT. Two of them — Shahid Kuttay and Adnan Shafi Dar — were locals from Shopian. Their family homes had been demolished after the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists. The identity of the third terrorist is yet to be confirmed.While investigators are yet to establish a direct link between the trio and the Pahalgam massacre, police records show Kuttay had been an active terrorist since March 2023 and was involved in multiple attacks, including the April 8 shooting at Danish Resort in Shopian, which left two German tourists and their driver injured.Dar, who joined LeT in October 2024, killed a migrant labourer in Shopian’s Wachi the same day he joined the group, police said.Posters in Urdu have appeared across Shopian offering a reward of Rs 20 lakh for leads on suspects involved in the Pahalgam killings. One reads: “Those who killed innocents do not have a place in our country.”Operation Keller was launched following intelligence inputs from Rashtriya Rifles about the presence of armed terrorists in the area. The encounter marks Kashmir’s second major counterterrorism success this year, following the March 16 killing of a Pakistani terrorist in Handwara.Security forces remain on high alert amid a temporary pause in Indo-Pak hostilities that followed India’s May 7 airstrikes on nine terror launchpads in PoK under Operation Sindoor.","Security forces in J&K's Shopian recovered a large cache of weapons after neutralizing three LeT terrorists.

Femicide crisis in Mexico





A 23-year-old Mexican beauty influencer Valeria Márquez , was fatally shot during a TikTok live stream on Tuesday. The chilling incident has reignited national outrage over gender-based violence.The brazen killing occurred at a beauty salon in Jalisco's Zapopan, where Márquez worked and was livestreaming to her followers. According to the Jalisco state prosecutor, the case is being investigated as a femicide, a gender-based crime that often involves degrading or sexually violent elements, ties to the perpetrator, or public exposure of the victim's body.Márquez, known for her makeup tutorials and beauty content, was livestreaming to her nearly 200,000 followers when the attack happened. Just moments before the shooting, she appeared on camera holding a stuffed toy and said, ""They're coming,"" in an anxious tone. A voice off-camera called out, ""Hey, Vale?"" to which she responded, ""Yes."" She then muted the audio.Seconds later, gunshots rang out. The stream appeared to capture the sound of the attack, and a person briefly picked up Márquez's phone, revealing part of their face before the live feed abruptly ended.The suspect, who has not been identified or apprehended, reportedly entered the salon and shot Márquez before fleeing.Earlier during the same live stream, Márquez had expressed concern over a visit from an unknown person who had come to the salon when she wasn't there, claiming to have brought her an ""expensive gift."" She told viewers she had no intention of waiting for them to return.Márquez's murder underscores Mexico's ongoing femicide crisis.

Silent on rights





DOHA: US President Donald Trump on Thursday closes a Middle East tour in the United Arab Emirates as he focuses squarely on seeking deals after billions of dollars of pledges from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.The first major trip of his second term had been scheduled to end Thursday but Trump, always ready with surprises, did not rule out continuing on to Turkey if Russian President Vladimir Putin shows up for talks with Ukraine.Trump will fly to the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi after a stop in Qatar, where the president hailed what he said was a record $200 billion deal for Boeing aircraft.He started the trip in Saudi Arabia which promised its own $600 billion in investment, including one of the largest-ever purchases of US weapons.The Gulf leaders' largesse has also stirred controversy, with Qatar offering Trump a luxury aeroplane ahead of his visit for presidential and then personal use, in what Trump's Democratic rivals charged was blatant corruption.Trump, who also chose Saudi Arabia for the opening visit of his first term, has been unabashed about seeking Gulf money and hailed the effect on creating jobs at home.In a speech in Riyadh, Trump attacked not only Democrats but also the traditional wing of his own Republican Party, which had championed US military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq.Complimenting the skyline of the Saudi desert capital, Trump said: ""The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called 'nation-builders', 'neocons' or 'liberal non-profits', like those who spent trillions failing to develop Kabul and Baghdad.""""Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought about by the people of the region themselves,"" he said.""In the end, the so-called 'nation-builders' wrecked far more nations than they built.""Trump steered clear of any hint of criticism of the Gulf monarchies on human rights.Trump's predecessor Joe Biden had initially vowed to shun Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over US intelligence findings that he ordered the gruesome murder in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi -- a Saudi dissident writer who lived in the United States.Trump instead hailed the crown prince, who is Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, as a visionary due to the kingdom's rapid economic investments.Trump also acceded to a key request by the crown prince in announcing a lifting of sanctions on Syria following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad in December.He met in Riyadh with Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former Islamist guerrilla once on the US wanted list who dressed in a suit and was complimented by Trump as a ""young, attractive guy"".Trump was joined in the meeting by Prince Mohammed and, virtually, by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the key supporter of the former Syrian rebels.Trump said Wednesday he was willing to travel to Turkey if Putin accepts an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet on ending the war.Russia has given no indication that Putin will attend.

Michigan's Rep. Shri Thanedar backs down on Trump impeachment effort

Shri Thanedar Asked If Impeachment Articles Against Trump Might Have The 'Opposite Effect'





Indian-origin Rep Shri Thanedar’s bid to impeach US President Donald Trump collapsed on Wednesday after fierce resistance from within his own party.The Michigan Democrat , who filed seven articles of impeachment in April, said he was backing off from forcing a House vote, opting instead to revise his resolution and build support across party lines.“After talking with many colleagues, I have decided not to force a vote on impeachment today,” Thanedar said, adding, “I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me.”He also claimed Trump had committed “more impeachable offenses” since April, including “accepting a $400 million jet from Qatar,” reported CNN.Thanedar had moved Tuesday to classify his resolution as “privileged,” triggering a mandatory vote within two legislative days. But by Wednesday afternoon, under pressure from Democratic leaders and colleagues, he reversed course.According to CBS News, the House had been preparing to table the motion, a move that would have effectively killed it.His articles accuse Trump of obstructing justice, abusing executive power, violating the First Amendment, and unlawfully creating the department of government efficiency (DOGE). Yet, his effort was swiftly dismissed even by fellow Democrats.Top judiciary Democrat Rep Jerry Nadler called the idea “idiotic” in a closed-door meeting, a remark that was met with applause, reported CNN.Democratic leadership, blindsided by the move, were frustrated. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries’ team believed Thanedar had previously assured them he wouldn’t proceed. Rep Greg Stanton of Arizona criticised the timing, saying, “Any Democrat not focused on getting us to 218 is either wasting our time or helping Republicans.”Rep Jamie Raskin was quoted by CBS News as saying, “It’s not enough to be right. You need consensus. You need a strategy.” Leadership was particularly concerned that the motion would distract from their focus on opposing GOP-led spending cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. CBS News also quoted Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar as saying, “This is not the right approach… Everything else is a distraction.”Thanedar defended himself during a press conference, saying, “Many people in my party and elsewhere say, ‘Is this the right time?’ People all over the country are saying this is the right time to do it!” He added, “Some Democrats have called me a lunatic, just like the president has called me lunatic.”His resolution faced problems from the start.As per Fox News, four Democratic co-sponsors withdrew their names after learning the resolution wasn’t cleared with party leadership. Meanwhile, a White House spokesperson dismissed the move as a “reckless political act,” calling Trump’s actions “fully lawful and firmly rooted in the will of the American people.”This isn’t the first time Thanedar has taken a maverick stance. He faces a tough primary fight and his impeachment gambit may have been partly aimed at energising his base. But even he acknowledged the uphill battle, saying, “We’re not only going to fight the winning fights. We’re going to do it because it’s the right thing to do.”For now, Thanedar has stepped back but not out. “This is a process,” he said. “It’s not going to happen tomorrow or Thursday, but it’s a start.”","Michigan's Rep.

Ben Cohen, co-founder of the progressive ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s, was arrested on Capitol Hill on Wednesday during a protest that disrupted a Senate hearing involving health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.According to Fox News, Cohen was among seven individuals detained by the United States Capitol Police (USCP) during the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing. He was charged with “crowding, obstructing, or incommoding,” while others faced additional charges of resisting arrest and assaulting police officers.The protest erupted shortly after Kennedy began his testimony, with demonstrators shouting, “RFK kills people with hate!” as seen in footage.USA Today reported some protesters moved toward the front of the hearing room and were forcibly removed by police. Video showed Cohen being pulled out by an officer as Sen Bill Cassidy, who was chairing the session, paused the proceedings. “That was a made-for-C-SPAN moment,” Cassidy remarked after order was restored.Cohen, a long-time activist, later said on X, formerly Twitter, “I told Congress they're killing poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs, and they're paying for it by kicking poor kids off Medicaid in the US.”Sharing footage of his removal, he added, “This was the authorities' response”.Earlier that day, Cohen also appeared at a press conference with Representative Rashida Tlaib and other progressive activists, criticising US support for Israel during its ongoing war in Gaza.“We are expected to be good Americans and look the other way as Israel prevents food, water and medicine from reaching the remaining people of Gaza,” Cohen said, as quoted by USA Today. “We will not look away. We will not be silenced.”Cohen’s arrest is not his first in Washington. In 2023, he was detained while protesting outside the department of justice over the imprisonment of Julian Assange, Fox News noted.Ben & Jerry’s has long been associated with left-leaning political activism. The company, acquired by Unilever in 2000, still maintains an independent board to preserve its advocacy work. In 2021, it made headlines by halting sales in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, referring to them as “Occupied Palestinian Territory,” reported Axios.","Ben Cohen, co-founder of the progressive ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s, was arrested on Capitol Hill on Wednesday during a protest.

Poll Do you believe NATO should increase defense spending to 5% of GDP? Yes, it's necessary for security. No, it's too high a target.

Talks on Ukraine also in Turkey



Trump administration pushes for NATO members to spend more on defence







ANTALYA: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Nato counterparts meet in Turkey on Thursday to prepare a pivotal summit of alliance leaders next month that will set the course for future European security as America focuses on challenges elsewhere.The meeting in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya comes amid a flurry of negotiations aimed at producing a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, including talks in Istanbul that Rubio and President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff plan to attend Friday. Rubio and Witkoff are coming to Turkey after accompanying Trump on portions of his trip to Gulf Arab countries.On the sidelines of the Nato meeting, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Wednesday with Rubio, who also is having separate talks with new German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, whose country is trying to help broker a deal that might end the more than three-year-old war.Sybiha and Fidan on Wednesday discussed efforts to establish a ceasefire and steps toward securing a lasting peace with Russia, according to the Turkish foreign ministry.The same day that Nato foreign ministers gather, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. It's an open question whether Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin will participate Thursday.Trump teased a possible visit to Istanbul while flying from Saudi Arabia to Qatar on Wednesday, but there was no immediate indication that his travel plans would change.""He'd like me to be there, and that's a possibility,"" Trump said, referring to Putin. ""I don't know that he would be there if I'm not there. We're going to find out.""Zelenskyy has been pushing for direct talks with Russia but only if Putin attends. Putin, who has rebuffed previous such calls, has been coy and has not committed to a meeting.The Kremlin on Wednesday said Putin's aide, Vladimir Medinsky, will head the Russian delegation, which also will include Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin and Igor Kostyukov, chief of the General Staff's main directorate. The list did not include Putin himself.Zelenskyy also remains keen on Ukraine joining Nato, which Russia has adamantly rejected and Trump appears to have agreed with. So even with a Ukrainian presence in Antalya, it appeared unlikely there would be any decisions made about Ukraine's future, or lack thereof, in the military alliance.Of greater concern to the US is money, with the Trump administration saying it wants to hear how European members of Nato and Canada plan to boost their national defense investments to 5% of gross domestic product.In 2023, as Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine entered its second year, Nato leaders agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on national defense budgets. So far, 22 of the 32 member countries have done so.The leaders will set a new goal at a summit in The Hague on June 25. Trump insists that US allies should commit to spending at least 5% to be ready to defend themselves, but that would require investment at an unprecedented scale.Trump has cast doubt over whether the US would defend allies that spend too little. The US was projected to have spent 3.38% last year, Nato figures show, the only ally whose spending has dropped over the last decade. Asked last month whether the US would match the 5% target, Rubio said, ""Sure. We're heading there now.""""Make no mistake, this ministerial is going to be different,"" US envoy to Nato Matthew Whitaker said this week, adding that ""5% is not just a number, it is a necessity for our security. The alliance is facing significant threats.""He did not outline those threats. Nato leaders insisted at their summit last year that ""Russia remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies' security,"" but some countries are uneasy about Trump reengaging with Putin.Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister who is hosting the meeting, is expected to express Turkey's commitment to strengthening NATO and call for the inclusion of NATO allies that aren't European Union members - such as Turkey - into European security and defense initiatives, according to Turkish officials.Fidan also would advocate a comprehensive, ""360-degree security"" approach focusing not only on ending the Russia-Ukraine war but also on stability in the Middle East and regions adjacent to NATO members, the officials said.The plan on higher defense spending Meanwhile, the defense spending plan under consideration appears to be for all allies to aim for 3.5% of GDP on ""hard military spending by 2032,"" and an extra ""1.5% related spending (on) infrastructure, cybersecurity and things like that. Also achievable by 2032,"" according to the Dutch government.While the two figures add up to 5%, factoring in infrastructure and cybersecurity would change the basis on which Nato traditionally calculates defense spending. The seven-year time frame is also short by the alliance's usual standards.Whitaker, the US Nato ambassador, appeared this week to confirm the plan, saying it ""also includes things like mobility, necessary infrastructure, cybersecurity. It is definitely more than just missiles, tanks and howitzers.""It's difficult to see how many allies might reach even 3.5% of GDP.

Poll Do you believe Sean Combs' threat towards Kid Cudi's car was serious? Yes, it was a serious threat. No, it was just talk.





American rapper Kid Cudi’s car mysteriously exploded in his driveway shortly after Sean “Diddy” Combs threatened to blow it up, his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura testified in a New York court on Wednesday.The claim came during Combs’ ongoing sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, where Ventura is a key government witness. She told the jury that the threat came in late 2011, shortly after the hip-hop mogul discovered she had started dating Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi , reports the New York Post.“He mentioned when we were out of the country that Scott’s car would be blown up and he wanted his friends to see it,” Ventura said in her testimony.Later, when she and Combs met Cudi at SoHo House in New York, she recalled the rapper asking, “What about my vehicle?” Combs coolly responded, “What vehicle?” and said no more. The meeting ended there.Ventura and Combs were in a volatile relationship that lasted 11 years. She first publicly alleged in a 2023 civil lawsuit that Combs had made the car bomb threat, and that Cudi’s vehicle had exploded around the same time.In court, Ventura detailed how Combs discovered her relationship with Cudi. She said he went through her phone during what she described as a “freak-off,” a term used for the sexual events Combs allegedly organised. He found emails between her and one of his assistants, Capricorn Clark, about delivering her toiletries to Cudi’s home.After the discovery, Ventura said Combs “lunged” at her with a corkscrew and later kicked her in the back as she left his home. The court was shown photos of bruises she suffered on her back and legs, which were taken by her mother.She also described disturbing scenes in her hotel room that night, claiming she returned to find the toilet full of faeces, furniture knocked over, and urine on the floor.An email Ventura wrote in December 2011 to her mother and Clark was also read in court. “The threats that [Sean Combs] has made of me are that he will release 2 sexually explicit videos: one on xmas day [and one other],” she wrote.Ventura admitted that she downplayed the abuse when she first told her mother. “No, I told her it was the first time,” she said when asked if she had been open about the violence.Combs has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking and racketeering charges. If convicted, he could face a life sentence.","Cassie Ventura testified in Sean Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.

On Trump’s Nobel Prize prospects





A Pakistani journalist faced a sharp rebuff from the US state department official after attempting to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stance on de-escalation talks between India and Pakistan. During a briefing on Wednesday, the Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff and claimed that India, particularly PM Modi, did not welcome Trump’s supposed ceasefire efforts.""Pakistan welcomed President Trump's efforts for bringing the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and they believe that President Trump could win a Nobel Peace Prize if he were to bring peace between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue. But Prime Minister Modi did not welcome this effort... Does that disappoint this building at all, the attitude of Narendra Modi of not welcoming this peace deal,"" the reporter asked Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson at the US department of state.Sidestepping the pointed query, Pigott emphasised that the US was focused on maintaining the ceasefire. “That is what we are happy to see. That's where our focus remains. And we want to see a ceasefire be maintained, and we want to encourage direct communication.That is our focus here. Our focus is the ceasefire,” he said. Pigott reiterated that both India and Pakistan should maintain direct communication and pursue peace.While Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration facilitated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, India has asserted that it was Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a truce, driven by pressure after Indian strikes.Responding to the reporter’s claim that Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in easing India-Pakistan tensions, Pigott described Trump as a ""peacemaker.""""He's a peacemaker. He values peace. He's also a dealmaker, and he has shown that again and again and again in terms of both pursuing an America First agenda but also pursuing peace and wanting to see peace and conflicts come to an end,"" Pigott said.The journalist also brought up the use of Israeli drones by India during Operation Sindoor and questioned whether that might create complications between Pakistan and Israel, given Trump's Abraham Accords aimed at fostering ties among Jews, Muslims, and Christians.Pigott, however, steered the conversation back to Washington’s stated priorities: maintaining the ceasefire and encouraging direct dialogue between India and Pakistan. He reiterated that the US focus remains on resolving conflicts through peaceful means.","A Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff.

US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told lawmakers on Wednesday that Americans “should not be taking medical advice” from him, reports news agency Reuters.Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.Being a long-time critic of vaccines, Kennedy was grilled by both the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate HELP Committee during back-to-back hearings. His remarks came amid a measles outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people and led to three deaths, mostly among the unvaccinated.When asked if he would give his children the measles vaccine today, Kennedy replied, “Measles? Probably for measles, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.”The hearings were meant to review US President Donald Trump ’s proposed 2026 health budget. Kennedy was confirmed in February and has already fired 10,000 staff across key agencies, including the FDA and CDC.He has also supported slashing $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $3.6 billion from the CDC, claiming the changes would “save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year.”“Our reductions have focused on aligning HHS staffing levels to reflect the size of HHS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw around a 15% increase in the number of employees,” Kennedy told the House subcommittee.Democrats slammed the cuts as dangerous. “All while you peddle unfounded and dangerous vaccine skepticism, spread lies and misinformation about people living with autism,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.At the Senate hearing, Kennedy again declined to clearly support the MMR jab. “I’m not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there’s issues,” he said.When asked whether Elon Musk had influenced his decisions, Kennedy denied taking orders but admitted Musk had assisted with fraud detection. “Elon Musk gave us help in trying and figuring out where there was fraud and abuse in the department. But it was up to me to make the decision,” he said.Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, who helped secure Kennedy’s confirmation, said Americans deserved clarity. “Americans need direct reassurance from the administration, from you, Mr. Secretary, that its reforms will make their lives easier, not harder.”Audience members protested during the hearing, wearing stickers reading “When Bobby lies, children die” and chanting “RFK kills people with AIDS” before being removed by Capitol police.","Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.

Father-son duo charged with narco-terrorism, connected to Sinaloa cartel





Two top leaders of a violent faction within Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel have been indicted on unprecedented narco-terrorism charges after allegedly trafficking massive amounts of fentanyl into the United States. Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son, Pedro Inzunza Coronel, are now facing terrorism-related offences in a federal case unsealed on Tuesday, as announced by US attorney Adam Gordon for the Southern District of California.The pair are accused of leading “one of the largest and most sophisticated fentanyl production networks in the world,” said Gordon, who warned cartel leaders during a press briefing, “You are no longer the hunters. You are the hunted.”The indictment is the first by the department of justice’s newly formed Narco-Terrorism Unit and follows the Trump administration’s designation of the Sinaloa Cartel as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in February, under Executive Order 14157.According to the news agency Associated Press, this is a rare move as such labels are typically reserved for politically motivated terrorist groups.The father-son duo, along with five other leaders of the Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO), a powerful offshoot of the Sinaloa Cartel, have been charged with narco-terrorism, providing material support to terrorism, drug trafficking , and money laundering.The BLO has long been known for its brutal tactics including kidnappings, torture and murders, and operates with violent impunity across Mexico and Central America, including Tijuana.Federal officials, citing court documents, allege the Inzunzas trafficked “tens of thousands of kilograms of fentanyl” into the US.On December 3, 2024, Mexican law enforcement seized more than 1.65 tons of fentanyl from locations in Sinaloa tied to the duo, reportedly the largest fentanyl seizure globally, according to ICE.“These charges highlight the unwavering efforts of transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel to flood our communities with deadly drugs,” said Shawn Gibson, ICE HSI ’s San Diego special agent in charge.The case stems from “Operation Take Back America,” a nationwide DOJ initiative to dismantle cartels and transnational crime US attorney general Pamela Bondi declared, “Their days of brutalizing the American people without consequence are over, we will seek life in prison for these terrorists.”FBI San Diego’s acting special agent in charge Houtan Moshrefi added that the cartel’s activities “not only destroy lives and communities, but also threaten our national security.”Other indicted cartel leaders include Fausto Isidro Meza Flores (“Chapo Isidro”), Oscar Manuel Gastelum Iribe (“El Musico”), and Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar (“El Chapito”). All remain fugitives.Pedro Inzunza Noriega, also known as “Sagitario,” reportedly operates from Los Mochis, Sinaloa, and is paralysed following a past attack by rival cartel members, as per AP.The charges carry penalties ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment, including multimillion-dollar fines. The case is being prosecuted by assistant US attorneys Joshua Mellor and Matthew Sutton.","Father-son duo charged with narco-terrorism, connected to Sinaloa cartel.

Trump appeals for Qatar's help in persuading Iran to give up its nuclear programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-appeals-for-qatars-help-in-persuading-iran-to-give-up-its-nuclear-programme/articleshow/121176191.cms,"Trump appeals for Qatar's help in persuading Iran to give up its nuclear programme

Poll Do you believe that Qatar can effectively mediate between the US and Iran regarding the nuclear deal? Yes, Qatar has a strong history of mediation. No, Iran is unlikely to cooperate.





DOHA: President Donald Trump urged Qatar on Wednesday to use its influence over Iran to persuade the country's leadership to reach an agreement with the US to dial back its rapidly advancing nuclear programme. Trump, who is visiting the Gulf nation as part of a three-country Mideast swing, made the appeal during a state dinner held in his honour by Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Qatar, over the years, has played the role of intermediary between the US and Iran and its proxies, including during talks with Tehran-backed Hamas as its 19-month war with Israel grinds on.""I hope you can help me with the Iran situation,"" Trump said during remarks at the formal dinner. ""It's a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing.""Trump wants Iran to stop backing militant proxy groupsThe appeal to Qatar came after Trump told leaders at a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting earlier Wednesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that he wants ""to make a deal,"" but Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the Mideast as part of any potential agreement.The US and Iran brokered a nuclear deal in 2015, during Democrat Barack Obama's administration, in which Iran agreed to drastically reduce its stockpile of uranium and only enrich up to 3.67 per cent.But that deal was scrapped during the first Trump administration.Today, Iran enriches up to 60 per cent, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels, and has enough stockpiled for multiple nuclear bombs should it choose to build them.The Qatari emir told Fox News Channel on Wednesday night that ""we agree that we want a nuclear-free region, and we cannot afford a nuclear race in that region.""But, Al Thani said, ""Iran has its right to have a nuclear - a civilian nuclear power, while not also representing any challenge or any threat for anyone in the region."" He said the issue needs to be resolved diplomatically.The US and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month about the country's nuclear programme. Trump has said that he believes brokering a nuclear deal is possible but that the window is closing.At the state dinner, he called on Iran's leadership to ""get moving"" or risk the situation spiralling into a head-on conflict.""Because things like that get started and they get out of control,"" Trump said. ""I've seen it over and over again. They go to war and things get out of control, and we're not going to let that happen.""Trump, in his appearance at the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Riyadh, also said that Tehran ""must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons"" as conditions for any deal.The call for Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen comes as that proxy network has faced significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas launched its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.In Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Trump's remarks ""deceitful"" but did not directly address his demands.Trump said that he also believed the moment was ripe ""for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists."" Hezbollah is severely weakened after its war last year with Israel, in which much of its top leadership was killed and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a conduit for Iran to send arms.While in Riyadh, Trump also met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a face-to-face engagement with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by US forces after being captured in Iraq.Al-Sharaa was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham stormed Damascus and ended the 54-year rule of the Assad family.Trump said he decided to meet with al-Sharaa after being encouraged to do so by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He also pledged to lift yearslong sanctions on Syria.The White House billed the al-Sharaa meeting as a brief ""pull aside"" that ended up lasting 33 minutes.Trump told reporters that the meeting went ""great"" and described him as a ""young, attractive guy"" with a ""very strong past.""""He's got a real shot at holding it together,"" Trump said.Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling US forces in Iraq after the US -led invasion. He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq. The US once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.Al-Sharaa returned to his home country of Syria after the conflict began in 2011 and led al-Qaida's branch called the Nusra Front. He changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and cut links with al-Qaida.The sanctions go back to the rule of Bashar Assad, who was ousted in December, and were intended to inflict major pain on his economy.In Qatar, Trump was greeted at the airport by Al Thani. Air Force One was escorted by Qatari F-15 jets as it neared Doha, the capital city.The emir said he had high hopes for Trump's efforts with Iran and at ending the war in Gaza.""I know that you are a man of peace,"" he said. ""I know that you want to bring peace to this region.""","Qatar has played the role of intermediary between the US and Iran and its proxies.

The announcement came after Trump met interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh, marking the first meeting between a US leader and a Syrian head of state in 25 years. Trump praised Sharaa as a “tough guy” with a “very strong past”, a striking remark given the Syrian leader's former ties to jihadist groups and his inclusion on a US terrorism list as recently as 2013.CNN reported that Sharaa, once known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani and leader of al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, had a $10 million US bounty on his head before seizing power and expelling Iran-backed militias from Syria. His rapid rise to leadership and rebranding as a national figurehead has prompted mixed reactions globally, with some Arab nations embracing his legitimacy and others, like Israel, remaining deeply sceptical.While in Riyadh, Trump sat down with Sharaa and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan via video link. Trump told reporters that he had encouraged Syria to join the Abraham Accords and normalise ties with Israel.Although no formal commitment was made, he said Sharaa had responded positively.Trump also said he had urged Sharaa to expel foreign militants and assume control over detention camps holding Islamic State fighters — a task currently managed by Kurdish forces backed by the US but opposed by Turkey. “They have a lot of work to do,” Trump added, noting that sanctions had left Syria in dire straits. He called the punitive measures “crippling” and said lifting them would give Syria a “strong chance” at rebuilding.The response in Syria was immediate. Celebrations broke out in major cities, with residents hoping the end of sanctions would reverse years of economic devastation. A soap factory owner in Aleppo told reporters the decision would “boost the economy and encourage people to return”.According to CNN and other experts cited, US sanctions have been in place for decades, with three main regimes: the 1979 designation of Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism, the 2003 Syria Accountability Act, and the 2019 Caesar Act. These measures have severely restricted financial transactions, humanitarian operations, and everyday commerce, pushing 90% of Syrians below the poverty line.Syrian economist Karam Shaar told CNN that the effects of lifting sanctions wouldn’t be immediate. “Sanctions aren’t a switch,” he said, cautioning that only a full rollback of overlapping restrictions would make a difference. However, even the symbolic gesture has already caused Syria’s currency to rise by 60%, signalling market optimism.Humanitarian organisations say the announcement could be transformative. “It marks a potentially transformative moment for millions of Syrians who have endured more than 13 years of economic hardship, conflict, and displacement,” said Mathieu Rouquette, Syria country director for Mercy Corps.","US President Donald Trump announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria.

NEW YORK: Colombian Sindy Estrada and her family try to stay off the streets of New York as they battle her deportation order for fear they could be detained by the authorities.Estrada and her family received a deportation order from the US government telling them to leave the country by April 30.""It has caused a nervous breakdown -- we have suffered stress, depression, anxiety, panic,"" said the businesswoman, 36, who fled Colombia three years ago after her husband's business was targeted by extortionists.N ow, US immigration officials have fitted her husband with an electronic ankle bracelet to track his whereabouts and her 16-year-old son has begun therapy amid the emotional toll of their situation.Her son ""started biting his nails and couldn't sleep, his grades dropped a lot,"" Estrada said. ""At his school they ask him what's going on -- whether he will stay or go.""""(Despite) my desire to pack a suitcase and go... I think about what would await me there. I'm afraid to return to Colombia.""Estrada and her family, who live in New Jersey, are among the millions of undocumented migrants in the United States fearful of President Donald Trump 's onslaught against non-citizens.Experts say his crackdown has exerted a psychological toll akin to the September 11, 2001 attacks that claimed almost 3,000 lives.Trump has vowed to undertake the largest mass deportation of undocumented migrants, who number around 11 million, in US history.He denounces people who entered the country illegally, visa overstayers, or those with legal temporary residence permits while they pursue options like asylum, describing them as ""criminals"" who must be returned at all costs.Trump has been accused of unlawful deportations without due process to a maximum security counterterrorism prison in El Salvador while also scrapping the longstanding policy of US citizenship through birth and seeking to block migrants challenging their detention.In the past week the Republican offered a $1,000 payout to undocumented migrants who leave voluntarily.Although the shock troops of Trump's crackdown, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, insist they target undocumented criminals, US media reports few arrestees fall into that category.The presence of ICE agents in migrant neighborhoods or on subway routes used by immigrants, particularly Hispanics, has sown fear.The ""uncertainty, fear, anguish"" experienced by migrants ""is similar to what was endured during the September 11 attacks"" of 2001, said New York City Department of Health Services mental health consultant Juan Carlos Dumas.The mental health crisis has led to increased alcohol and drug abuse, as well as family conflict, the Argentine psychotherapist, 68, told AFP.""The anguish has to go somewhere,"" he said.Self-harming among young people has increased, just as it did after 9/11, he said.Youths ""exorcise their feelings through aggression,"" Dumas said at the gate of a school in Harlem where he works to detect such issues among pupils.""They each try to deal with the fear in their own way,"" he said. ""We haven't seen anything like this for years.""Migrants who have been in the country for many years and built a life are affected the most.The prospect of having to leave it is ""totally traumatizing,"" he said, recommending that no one should feel the need to stay indoors.Dumas said that New York, a sanctuary city where local police do not cooperate with ICE to deport people, has a range of mental health services including social workers, psychologists and therapists for those in need.""Not everyone has it in for migrants,"" he said.","Sindy Estrada and her family received a deportation order from the US government.

Trump-era ""border czar"" Tom Homan has lashed out at Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , saying he wishes she would “do her job” after she downplayed questions about a potential Justice Department probe into her role in a controversial webinar advising migrants on dealing with ICE agents.“She’s a legislator, right? Why doesn’t she pass some legislation and actually improve this country like President Donald Trump is already doing?” Homan told Fox News Digital. “I’m doing my job: the border is secure. We arrested three times more criminals than Biden did. She should try doing her job.”His comments followed AOC’s claim that she hadn’t heard from the DOJ and wasn’t sure whether she was under investigation for hosting an online session guiding undocumented immigrants on their rights. Homan previously suggested that her actions particularly advising people not to open their doors to ICE could constitute obstruction.Homan appeared on Capitol Hill this week at the invitation of Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, to brief House Republicans on border security . When asked whether Democrats who recently joined protests outside a Newark ICE facility including Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Robert Menendez, and LaMonica McIver should face consequences, he replied, “Yes,” supporting the idea of censure or removal from committee assignments.Ocasio-Cortez responded to Homan in a fiery Instagram post, saying, “You lay a finger on any of the representatives that were there – and we’re going to have a problem.” When told of this warning, Homan reportedly laughed and said sarcastically, “I’m extremely intimidated.”Their war of words escalated earlier this week after Homan called AOC “the dumbest congresswoman ever elected to Congress” during a Newsmax interview. She fired back on X: “This is why you fight these cowards. The moment you stand up to them, they crumble.”","“She’s a legislator, right?

Judge backs wartime law for deportation

(With inputs from NYT)





A federal judge on Wednesday ordered that a Georgetown scholar from India be released from immigration detention after he was detained in the Trump administration’s crackdown on foreign college students. Badar Khan Suri , who is being held in Texas, will go home to his family in Virginia while he awaits the outcome of his petition against the Trump administration for wrongful arrest and detention in violation of the First Amendment and other constitutional rights.He’s also facing deportation proceedings in an immigration court in Texas. Before ordering his release, district judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in Alexandria said she was releasing him because she felt Suri had substantial constitutional claims against the Trump administration.She also considered the needs of his family and said she didn’t believe he was a danger to the community. The Trump govt had said his visa was revoked because of his online posts and his wife’s connection to Gaza as a Palestinian American. They accused him of supporting Hamas. Mapheze Saleh, Suri’s wife, is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas member whom Israel assassinated last year in Iran.“Speech regarding the conflict there and opposing Israel’s military campaign is likely protected political speech,” Giles said. “And thus he was likely engaging in protected speech.” She added: “The First Amendment does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens” Suri was arrested by masked, plain-clothed officers on the evening of March 17 outside his apartment complex in Virginia.By the time a petition had been filed to keep his case in Virginia, authorities had put him on a plane to Louisiana without allowing him to update his family or lawyer, Suri’s attorneys said. A few days later, he was moved again to Texas. Before Wednesday’s hearing, US attorneys argued that Suri’s case should be moved from Virginia to Texas because the petition was filed after the scholar had already left the state.They said filing his case in Texas is a “relatively straightforward application of wellsettled law”. Giles agreed with Suri’s attorneys from American Civil Liberties Union, who argued that it had appeared the real reason he was moved to Texas was to bring the case before a more conservative court. Khan Suricame to the US in 2022 through a J-1 visa, working at Georgetown as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow.He has three children: a 9-yearold son and 5-year-old twins. Before his arrest, he taught a course on majority and minority human rights in South Asia. Court filings said he hoped to become a professor and embark on a career in academia.A federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge on charges she helped a man in the country illegally evade US immigration authorities looking to arrest him as he appeared before her in a local domestic abuse case. Milwaukee county circuit judge Hannah Dugan’s arrest and ensuing indictment has escalated a clash between Trump govt and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted. Her team of defence attorneys said that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. Dugan is scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.A federal judge on Tuesday opened a path for Trump govt to move forward with deporting a Venezuelan man under Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, but ruled it must first give him notice in his native language, 21 days to object and an “opportunity to be heard” in court. The ruling, by judge Stephanie L Haines from the western district of Pennsylvania, could provide a legal opening for govt to restart deportations under the Act of Venezuelans whom it considers members of Tren de Aragua, a gang that the White House has designated as a terrorist organisation. The American Civil Liberties Unionsaid it would appeal Haines’ decision.","Badar Khan Suri will go home to his family in Virginia while he awaits the outcome of his petition against the Trump administration for wrongful arrest and detention.

Pakistan envoy honeytrapped in Bangladesh? Sudden exit after viral videos sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-envoy-honeytrapped-in-bangladesh-sudden-exit-after-viral-videos-sparks-row/articleshow/121164452.cms,"



Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

As part of the offensive, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads, including major hubs of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke.In retaliation, Pakistan launched a series of drone incursions into Indian airspace over subsequent nights. These drones were in a quick response were intercepted and neutralised by India's air defence systems.After Pak's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.Although both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on Saturday, an initiative that reportedly came from Islamabad, the ceasefire was short-lived. Pakistan violated the agreement within hours of talks between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides.The Pakistan military released names of several personnel killed in the strikes.

Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.
