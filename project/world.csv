Brazil’s streets filled with anger on Sunday as tens of thousands rallied against moves in Congress to pass an amnesty that could spare former president Jair Bolsonaro from a 27-year prison sentence. Demonstrators accused lawmakers of plotting to shield themselves from prosecution while protecting the far-right leader.The protests, organised in all 26 states and the federal district, erupted just days after the lower house rushed forward a bill that could pardon Bolsonaro, his allies and hundreds of supporters convicted over the storming of government buildings in January 2023.Crowds roared “No amnesty” as they waved flags and carried signs condemning what many described as a shameless attempt to grant impunityProtesters were also outraged by a separate measure, dubbed the “Banditry Bill,” which would require secret ballots in Congress to authorise criminal proceedings against lawmakers. Critics said the move would effectively grant politicians immunity.“This protection they seek is to camouflage corruption, impunity,” said psychology student Giovana Araujo, who joined a musical rally on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro. There, legendary musicians Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Chico Buarque performed songs of resistance from Brazil’s dictatorship era. “Once again, artists are mobilising the people to demand justice in this country,” added sociology student Yasmin Aimee Coelho Pessoa.The University of São Paulo’s Political Debate Monitor estimated 42,000 protesters in São Paulo and a similar turnout in Rio — the largest left-wing mobilisation since Lula’s election victory in 2022. The scenes included blow-up dolls of Bolsonaro in prison stripes alongside one of Donald Trump, whose tariffs and sanctions on Brazil were cited by protesters as evidence of foreign meddling.Outrage has been fuelled further by revelations that several deputies voted for the “Shielding Bill” under pressure from party leaders. Some later apologised publicly, while President Lula vowed to veto any amnesty measure.“The left is reorganising in the face of all these atrocities. And I feel like we’ve reached that choking point,” said environmental engineer Henrique Marques, among thousands demonstrating in Brasilia.Polls underline the divide: 50% of Brazilians support Bolsonaro serving jail time, while 43% oppose it.",Tens of thousands rally against moves in Congress to pass an amnesty that could spare former president Jair Bolsonaro from a 27-year prison sentence.

NEW DELHI: Locked in a watchman’s room, fed stale food and threatened with dire consequences if he didn’t pay for the damage caused to an SUV — this is how cement mixer truck helper Prahlad Chauhan described his captivity after being allegedly abducted by the family of dismissed IAS officer Puja Khedkar.Based on his statement, police have added graver charges against Puja’s father, Dilip Khedkar, and his driver, Praful Salunkhe, who were initially booked only for kidnapping.Chauhan told police, ""they took away his phone and confined him to a room for the watchman and cook. He was given stale food after being threatened with dire consequences if he did not pay up for the damage caused to the SUV.""""Hence, apart from the BNS section for kidnapping, we have invoked additional sections against Khedkar and Salunkhe for voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful confinement, extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt, and common intention,"" the police said.Salunkhe, who had been absconding since the incident, was tracked to Sindkheda in Dhule district late Friday after a six-day manhunt.Dilip remains on the run.The case stems from a road rage incident on Mulund-Airoli Road on September 13, when Khedkar’s SUV grazed a cement mixer truck. Chauhan, who was riding in the truck, was allegedly bundled into the SUV, which police are yet to recover.Meanwhile, Dilip’s wife, Manorama, has also been booked — first for obstructing police from rescuing the helper, and later for allegedly destroying CCTV evidence from the family’s Aundh bungalow in Pune.Police said, “It was found that Manorama Khedkar, with the intention of destroying evidence, gave her bedroom key to a person and removed the digital recorder.”Police said the search for Dilip and Manorama continues, while Salunkhe is now in custody.","Praful Salunkhe, who had been absconding since the incident, was tracked to Sindkheda in Dhule district late Friday after a six-day manhunt.

Bengaluru: A special court for Lokayukta cases in Tumakuru Saturday found a retired gynaecologist from a govt hospital guilty of accepting a bribe of Rs 2,000 to carry out a delivery for a daily wage worker in Feb 2021. The court sentenced her to five years of rigorous imprisonment.CN Mahalakshmamma retired two years ago after serving as a gynaecologist at Tumakuru district hospital. Passing the orders, judge Yasmin Parveen Ladkhan imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on the convict and directed her to undergo an additional six months of simple imprisonment in case of payment default.Special public prosecutor N Basavaraju told TOI that this was not a trap case. A complaint was lodged with Tumakuru Lokayukta police wing after the bribe was paid. The complainant recorded the oral conversation with the doctor on his mobile phone, where Mahalakshmamma was heard demanding Rs 3,000 to carry out the delivery.""The woman, a daily wage worker, was brought to the govt hospital with labour pain on the night of Feb 2, 2021 by her brother-in-law. There, Mahalakshmamma demanded a bribe of Rs 3,000 from the brother-in-law and threatened that she would not attend to the patient until the money was paid,"" he said.""The woman was writhing in pain, but that did not affect Mahalakshmamma. The woman's husband, also a daily wage worker, was away in the field. Summoned by his brother, he rushed to the hospital. With great difficulty, they arranged a Rs 2,000 bribe, and the brother-in-law handed it over to Mahalakshmamma through a Group D staffer of the hospital,"" he added.The brother-in-law asked Mahalakshmamma if it was right to act so ruthlessly during an emergency, which could have affected the pregnant woman and the child. To this, Mahalakshmamma reportedly said: ""Everyone pays the bribe of Rs 3,000 for delivery cases"", and that he was no exception. ""The man was smart enough to record this oral conversation on his mobile phone,"" Basavaraju said.On Feb 4, 2021, the brother-in-law filed a complaint with Lokayukta police against Mahalakshmamma.""The police launched the investigation. The voice recording was sent to the forensic science laboratory, and its reports confirmed that the voices were those of the brother-in-law and Mahalakshmamma. Along with other circumstantial evidence, a chargesheet was filed against Mahalakshmamma, accusing her of demanding and accepting the bribe. During the trial, the same voice recording was played in court,"" Basavaraju stated.","CN Mahalakshmamma retired two years ago after serving as a gynaecologist at Tumakuru district hospital.

Trump’s Big Strike On Indians; $100,000 Fee Slapped On H-1B Visas





The US administration plans a major change to the H-1B visa programme, with President Donald Trump expected to sign a proclamation Friday imposing a $100,000 application fee, according to a White House official, quoted in a Bloomberg report.The order is intended to curb misuse of the visa category and its perceived impact on American jobs. Entry under the programme would require the hefty payment, the official said (anonymously), while the Labour Secretary will be directed to begin revising H-1B wage rules to protect US workers from wage suppression.The technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects. The White House argues the new measures will bolster the integrity of the system and reduce exploitation. A document reviewed by Bloomberg News describes the replacement of American workers with lower-cost foreign labour as a national-security issue that discourages domestic STEM careers.It remains unclear whether the $100,000 fee will be added to or replace existing charges. Current costs include a $215 lottery registration and a $780 Form I-129 filing.The programme grants 85,000 visas annually through a lottery that some firms allegedly game by submitting multiple applications, often to hire lower-paid staff via staffing and outsourcing companies.This move aligns with broader immigration fee hikes for work permits, asylum requests and other services, intended to fund detention facilities, expanded border barriers and additional enforcement personnel.","The technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects.

President Trump HONORS Charlie Kirk While Leaving White House for Arizona Memorial | WATCH





US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk shared a rare public reunion on Sunday at the funeral of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, months after a bitter public feud between the former president and the Tesla CEO. The pair were seen exchanging a handshake in a private suite at State Farm Arena in Glendale, Arizona, as tens of thousands gathered to mourn Kirk, who was shot dead at a Utah college earlier this month. Video of the encounter was shared by Musk on X, captioned simply: “For Charlie”.Lip readers watching the brief interaction have shed light on the conversation, suggesting a thaw in relations between the two. Nicola Hickling speaking to the Daily Mail saidthat Trump opened with “how are you doing” as he approached Musk. Musk appeared to shrug before Trump continued, “So Elon, I’ve heard you wanted to chat.” UFC icon Dana White also joined the exchange, prompting Trump to say, “Let’s try and work out how to get back on track. ” Musk responded with a nod, before Trump added, “I’ve missed you”The encounter comes after a tumultuous year in which Musk resigned from his position as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), following criticism of Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act.Musk warned the legislation could “cost taxpayers billions and increase government debt,” prompting a very public fallout that saw Trump call Musk a “b--- artist” and threaten federal contracts with his companies. Musk also briefly suggested federal authorities held damaging information on Trump in the Jeffrey Epstein files.Despite the rancour, the funeral marked a moment of political symbolism. Kirk, a key figure in mobilising young conservatives and a staunch Trump supporter, had a profound impact on the 2024 election, and both Trump and Musk had been instrumental in energising Republican voters. Musk alone contributed over $270 million through his super PAC, America PAC, to support Trump, while Kirk focused on grassroots mobilisation across college campuses. Their joint presence at the memorial highlighted the enduring influence both men hold within conservative circles.Trump used the service to pay tribute to Kirk’s legacy, calling him a “great American hero” and “martyr for America’s freedom.” Vice President J.D. Vance echoed this sentiment, urging attendees to honour Kirk by continuing his mission to defend the country and uphold Christian values. Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, also delivered a poignant address, forgiving Tyler Robinson, the man charged with her husband’s murder, saying: “I forgive him, I forgive him because it is what Christ did.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

February 25–27, 1968: Rulers from Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain , Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah , Bahrain, and Qatar met in Dubai to draft a federal framework.



The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2, 1971: The birth of the UAE and National Day





July 18, 1971: The six Rulers formally agreed to establish a federation.

December 2, 1971: The United Arab Emirates was officially declared an independent, sovereign state.



A Provisional Constitution was adopted. Abu Dhabi was designated as the temporary capital. Sheikh Zayed was elected as the first President; Sheikh Rashid became Vice-President, both for a five-year term. The Federal National Council (FNC) was established with 34 seats:



8 each for Abu Dhabi and Dubai 6 for Sharjah 4 each for Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah Ras Al Khaimah was allocated 6 seats should it choose to join later.

The constitution

The Provisional Constitution guided federal operations from 1971 until it was made permanent in July 1996.

It consists of 152 articles, establishing the foundation of:



Governance Distribution of federal and local powers Citizens’ rights National security, judiciary, and legislative structure



Federal goals outlined in the constitution:

Preserve the UAE’s independence and sovereignty

Ensure security and stability

Defend against any external aggression

Protect citizens' rights and freedoms

Promote economic prosperity, better standards of living, and unified national identity

Uphold each emirate’s internal autonomy within the constitutional framework

Why the federation worked

Common language and religion

Shared customs, traditions, and topography

Complementary economic resources

Unified aspirations for development and stability

December 9, 1971: Gained admission to the United Nations

1972: Became a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)

1981: Co-founded the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.





December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

President Trump HONORS Charlie Kirk While Leaving White House for Arizona Memorial | WATCH

The Wall Street Journal





WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday teased what he called a “very important” announcement on autism, fuelling speculation about a fresh controversy over health claims.Speaking at a memorial event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona, Trump told the audience, “I think we found an answer to autism,” calling the forthcoming disclosure “one of the most important things that we will do.”He repeated the remark, saying it would be a “very important announcement,” but declined to elaborate, promising to discuss solutions in the Oval Office.The comments came a day after Trump said the planned revelation would rank among his administration’s top priorities. The president’s remarks have triggered renewed debate as his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has previously courted criticism for promoting unproven links between autism and certain medicines.Earlier this month,reported that Kennedy was preparing to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder, a neurodevelopmental condition marked by social and communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors.Trump, Kennedy have in the past suggested connections between autism, vaccines and other medications despite a lack of scientific evidence. Health experts and researchers have consistently rejected such claims as unfounded and potentially harmful.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday teased what he called a “very important” announcement on autism.

Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood. But for the millions already uprooted, the crisis has only just begun.","Nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

“

(With ANI inputs)





The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

DHAKA: ""Domestic and foreign forces"" were involved in the last year uprising against former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, and with their backing, Muhammad Yunus was offered the post of interim govt chief, her lawyer claimed in the International Crimes Tribunal on Sunday, as it tries her in cases of ""crimes against humanity"".Hasina did not resign from office but was compelled to ""leave for India"" last year following the mass uprising against her govt, said state-appointed defence counsel Md Amir Hossain, who is also representing former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. He made the claims during cross-examination of National Citizen Party convenor Nahid Islam, a key leader of the uprising. Nahid appeared as the 47th witness in the ongoing case.Hossain said, ""We do not intend to involve Muhammad Yunus unnecessarily, but this point was raised only in reaction to witness statements.""""Hasina never ordered use of helicopters or lethal weapons to suppress the movement. On the contrary, she did everything possible to protect lives, safeguard property, and maintain law and order,"" he said, adding, ""No crimes against humanity were committed during July-Aug 2024.

A British couple, who were detained in Afghanistan earlier this year, have been freed after the Qatari-mediated negotiations.Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March, AP reported.The couple have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, running “Rebuild,” an organisation providing education and training programmes. Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Nepal’s deposed prime minister K P Sharma Oli has denied that his government ordered security forces to open fire during the September 8 “Gen Z” protests that left at least 19 people dead.“The government didn’t order to shoot at the demonstrators,” the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) chairman said in a Constitution Day message on Friday. “The bullets were fired at the protesters from automatic guns, which were not possessed by the police personnel, and this must be investigated upon.”Oli alleged that “infiltrating conspirators” had turned the peaceful demonstrations violent. “The infiltrating conspirators turned the agitation violent, and this way our youths were killed,” he said, while demanding a formal inquiry into the incident.The two-day protests against alleged corruption and a ban on social media left at least 72 people dead, including three policemen.

Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

With Nepal slowly regaining normalcy after the deadly Sept 8-9 protests that left more than 70 people dead, police have turned their focus to identifying those behind the violence. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters, who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.Nepal police said they have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The evidence was submitted after an appeal by police urging people to share digital material pertaining to the protests while promising not to disclose the identity of the senders to ensure their safety.DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson of Nepal police, said the huge volume of citizen responses received would aid the investigation. ""The videos and photos that we have got from citizens will help us track down those involved in the violence. We will analyse the data and act accordingly. We urge people to share more evidence, if any.""His statement came amid another appeal by Kathmandu police cautioning people against buying looted items.During the protests, many had looted valuables from banks, supermarkets, jewellery shops and other business establishments. Some perpetrators had also looted weapons and other items from police stations across the country.Earlier on Wednesday, ministers of the newly-formed interim govt visited the federal parliament building to assess the destruction. Rameshwor Prasad Khanal, the interim finance minister, said: ""The damage to properties is extensive across the country. We are assessing the loss after which necessary action would be taken to repair or rebuild properties. Our PM has already said that the vandalism and arson was a criminal act which will be punished. Police are therefore working towards bringing the perpetrators to justice.""Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, the sense of unease is palpable, especially among younger residents. Many say the fear of being linked to the unrest has changed everyday routines. ""Youngsters are now not just hesitant to come out of their homes but have also deleted their social media accounts,"" said Prashant Shrestha, who runs a souvenir shop in Thamel. ""There's fear of being identified for the loot and vandalism that caused so much loss to both public and private property. ""Ram Bahadur Chhetri, 64, a retired govt employee, termed the vandalism as a 'brainless act' while demanding strict action against perpetrators. ""Our country had somehow managed to get back on its feet after the 2015 earthquake . Now, again some people under the garb of protests against corruption, caused unforgettable damage. It will take years for us to cope with this loss,"" said Chhetri.","Nepal police have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

Charles plays the statesman



The transactional monarchist



Murdoch at the margins



Fortress walls and protest shadows



The bigger picture: Royals as Britain’s bargaining chip

Bottom Line







When Donald Trump strode into Windsor Castle this week in white tie, flanked by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, it wasn’t just another state dinner. It was Britain’s oldest political trick—deploying the monarchy as a velvet glove to soften a hard negotiation. The soaring banquet hall, filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry, wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a stage. Every polished suit of armour and gilded goblet was calculated to make Trump feel not just welcomed, but enthroned.For Britain, the stakes were high. With Trump’s second term already marked by tariffs, transactional diplomacy, and the unraveling of Western alliances, London needed leverage. The royal family, still Britain’s most effective soft power tool, provided it.Unlike the star-studded dinners of yesteryears—think Hollywood names or fashion royalty—this banquet was stocked with people who wield real influence. At the 160-seat table were Wall Street titans like Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Apple’s Tim Cook, plus media barons like Rupert Murdoch.The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour. The message—this is the club you still belong to, provided you play nice with us.Tim Cook’s presence was particularly striking. Barely weeks ago, he was in Trump’s bad books for skipping a Middle East trip. Yet here he was, seated beside Tiffany Trump, as if the Windsor seating chart itself was an act of reconciliation.King Charles used his toast to strike a balance—lavishing praise on Anglo-American friendship, while inserting subtle nudges about climate and Ukraine. The king knows Trump’s views on both issues are, at best, sceptical. But the gentle prod, wrapped in regal ceremony, seemed unlikely to provoke the famously thin-skinned president.Trump, for his part, basked in the flattery. He declared himself “the first American president welcomed here,” conveniently overlooking his own previous Windsor visit and the fact that past presidents had dined at Buckingham Palace. Accuracy mattered less than optics. In that moment, Trump was both guest and monarch, enjoying the rarest of British honours: being feted in a castle that has survived every empire from the Normans to the Nazis.Trump is not sentimental about monarchy. But he is sentimental about status. For a man who relishes gilded interiors, gold-plated trophies, and long tables of power, Windsor was the ultimate backdrop. Britain knows this. The castle setting was a calculated bet: flatter the president’s sense of grandeur, and he might be more pliable when it comes to trade talks or military cooperation.Downing Street, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, clearly coordinated with the palace. By seating Trump amid billionaires, bankers, and AI moguls, Britain showed it could still marshal global capital and innovation in ways that appeal to Trump’s business-first instincts.Yet even amid the choreography, there were hints of tension. Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s once-powerful ally turned legal adversary, was seated far from the president’s line of sight. Months earlier, Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal had broken the story about Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to lawsuits and public feuds. Still, Murdoch was present—because Britain needed the symbolism of its most famous media mogul under the same roof as its most mercurial guest.This was Windsor diplomacy in miniature: even enemies were summoned, but placed carefully so as not to disrupt the main performance.Outside the castle, the spectacle looked different. Protesters projected Trump’s photos with Epstein onto Windsor’s ancient stone walls. Last week in Washington, diners heckled him as “Hitler” during his first public meal out since re-election. The banquet, then, was a temporary reprieve—a fortress designed to shield Trump from the political storms raging beyond the moat.But no banquet lasts forever. Once Trump leaves the Great Hall’s chandeliers and tapestries, he must return to a world less deferential. Britain, however, bet that the glow of Windsor would linger long enough to influence Thursday’s talks at Downing Street.This isn’t new. Britain has long used its monarchy to oil the gears of diplomacy. From Churchill to Thatcher, British leaders have leveraged royal pageantry to charm, flatter, and occasionally disarm foreign leaders. For Trump, whose worldview is explicitly transactional, the spectacle is a tool of persuasion: Britain offers him honour in exchange for concessions.For Starmer, facing an uphill climb to reset Britain’s global standing post-Brexit, Trump’s goodwill is critical. Tariffs, NATO commitments, and US-UK trade are all on the table. The White House may demand tribute, but Windsor shows Britain still knows how to stage-manage power.The Windsor banquet was more than pomp. It was Britain signalling that, despite diminished economic clout, it retains the ability to convene and charm. The monarchy, carefully modernised but still cloaked in medieval grandeur, remains its most potent weapon of influence.Trump got what he wanted: adulation, status, and the appearance of global centrality. Britain got what it wanted: a chance to soften him up before hard negotiations. Both sides left the castle with something—but whether royal flattery can survive Trump’s tariff hammer is the test that lies ahead.",Donald Trump dined with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. The banquet hall was filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry. The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123974377,imgsize-193040,width-400,resizemode-4/state-banquet-at-windsor-castle.jpg"
UK King hosts Donald Trump at Windsor for historic state visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-king-hosts-donald-trump-at-windsor-for-historic-state-visit/articleshow/123954971.cms,"'Not Welcome Here': UK Protesters Confront Trump With Protests In Windsor





LONDON: US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory on Wednesday at Windsor Castle on their historic second state visit to Britain.Trump is the first US president ever to have a second state visit. Traditionally US presidents just have tea or lunch with the monarch on any subsequent visits to the UK.On Thursday Trump will travel to Chequers where he will meet UK PM Keir Starmer and unlock £31 billion worth of investments from America’s top technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure.The couple spent Tuesday night at the US ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park where Trump, perhaps suffering from jet lag, posted a flurry of posts on Truth Social until 3.23am UK time, including an article titled “US President Trump dials PM Modi, greets him on birthday”.On Wednesday they flew by Marine One to Windsor Castle and were taken in a horse-drawn procession, together with the King and Queen and William and Kate, through the estate. They watched military parades and Trump inspected the exceptionally large guard of honour.Lt Col Storm Green, captain of the guard of honour, said: “It is the first time we have got all three state colours out — the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards — for a foreign head of state.It’s the biggest one I have done in my 28-year career.”For Starmer, the visit serves as a welcome distraction to the problems he is facing domestically.After lunch, they viewed the Royal Collection where Trump took a particular interest in a document indicating when George III realised America was no longer under his control.They laid a wreath on the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at St George’s Chapel. After that there was due to be a flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets, followed by a glittering white-tie banquet.The entire day took place within the walls of Windsor Castle. Meanwhile “Stop Trump” demonstrators gathered in London and the Guardian ran an article by London mayor Sadiq Khan slamming Trump.Four men were arrested on Tuesday night after projecting a giant image of Trump and the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the exterior walls of Windsor Castle. Police swiftly stopped the projection. The men remain in police custody. Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, with whom he was friends earlier in life. On Wednesday, a van could be seen in Windsor displaying a large image on one side of Trump and Epstein with the message: ""Welcome to the UK, Donald. ""A Thames Valley Police spokesperson told TOI: “The driver was at risk of breaching the Road Traffic Regulations Act, and after a brief conversation with officers the motorist left the area. No arrests were made.”",US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory.

Protesters wave Union Jack and St George's England flags during the ""Unite The Kingdom"" rally on Westminster Bridge by the Houses of Parliament on September 13.





Hindus in the UK were placed in the spotlight at a massive rally in London on September 13, where far-right activist Tommy Robinson, known for his harsh criticism of Muslims, described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"".The remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back. Labour-run Leicester City Council has cancelled all public festivities apart from lighting up Diwali lanterns on lampposts and closing Belgrave Road on October 20. A safety advisory group cited public safety concerns after last year’s celebrations attracted a record 55,000 people.The contrast is striking. While Leicester’s Hindu community sees its biggest cultural showcase trimmed down to LED lights and a Ferris wheel, Robinson has positioned himself as a vocal defender of Hindus, especially in the wake of the 2022 Leicester unrest and the grooming gang scandals that have strained community relations.Following the Leicester clashes, Robinson vowed to protect British Hindus, even offering to mobilise “hundreds of men” to support them, as he told a right-wing Indian news outlet.His narrative has since amplified themes of Hindu victimhood, including claims of “a genocide on Hindus” in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, though videos he circulated at the time were later proven fake.In May, a police intelligence report cited by the Daily Mail noted growing links between far-right groups and Hindu extremists in Britain, rooted in a “shared hatred of Muslims”. The report, prepared by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said Robinson had engaged with Hindu organisations to push “anti-Muslim campaigns” and that “his presence seemed to be welcomed by the Indian media and a minority of British Hindus”.The NPCC stressed that moderate Hindus had strongly denounced any alliance between Hindutva supporters and white supremacists.Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, remains a divisive figure in the British right. He founded the English Defence League, notorious for violent street protests in the 2000s and 2010s, and has served multiple prison terms. His most recent conviction came in 2024, when he was sentenced to 18 months for defying a court order in a libel case involving a Syrian refugee.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"" Remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back.

Poll Do you think the judicial system is effective in addressing cases of workplace abuse? Yes, it works well No, it fails many victims





An Indian-origin heart surgeon, Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital in Lancaster. But Bose told the police when they arrested him that ""it was only flirting"".The incidents took place between 2017 and 2022. when he had headed the hospital's cardiovascular surgery department. One woman told the court that Bose's behavior was a well-known fact and newcomers used to be advised on how to deal with him.Bose regularly commented on women's appearances and called them 'fresh meat' on a WhatsApp group.One of Bose's victims told the court she was groped by the surgeon as she scrubbed up ahead of surgery. On another occasion, shortly after she joined the department, Bose rested his head on her shoulder. Another victim was groped in an operating theatre as she helped the consultant prepare for an operation. After putting his gloves on, Bose 'purposefully' grabbed her breast, the court heard.One woman said Bose groped her breast as he helped himself to a pen from her top pocket.One said she was touched inappropriately every time she saw him and that used to leave her frightened and anxious, forcing her to change her working time to avoid him.Defending Bose, Tom Price KC said he realised that Bose had put his victims through the ordeal of a trial but that his client had only fully realised their true hurt in court. The court was informed that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon but lost his job in the wake of the complaints and was now working as a parcel deliveryman.Judge Unsworth acknowledged that Bose was a highly skilled surgeon who had been held in high regard by his colleagues. But he said this simply served to make his offending ""all the more tragic"".","Amal Bose, 55, has been sentenced to six years in jail in the UK for abusing his position to sexually assault female colleagues at Blackpool Hospital.
