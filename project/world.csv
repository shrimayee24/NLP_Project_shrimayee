FIR against Kamra



Opposition support



NEW DELHI: Comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday sparked controversy after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a show in Mumbai.The incident drew a sharp response from Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers who went on to vandalise the venue where Kamra performed.During his stand-up show, Kamra performed a parody of a popular Hindi song from ""Dil To Pagal Hai,"" referring to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). He also made jokes about recent political developments in Maharashtra, including party splits within Shiv Sena and NCP.“Meri nazar se tum dekho to gaddar nazar wo aaye. Haaye,"" Kunal Kamra said during his show.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter... everyone got confused,"" he added.According to police officials, Shiv Sena workers vandalized Hotel Unicontinental in Mumbai’s Khar area, where Kamra's show with the 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe at Eknath Shinde was filmed. They also sought an FIR against him.AN FIR was registered against Shiv Sena Yuva Sena general secretary Rahool Kanal and 19 others for vandalising the Habitat standup comedy set under various sections of BNS and Maharashtra Police Act.Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel filed an FIR against Kamra and issued an ultimatum, demanding an apology within two days. Patel threatened to restrict Kamra's movement in Mumbai and promised to raise the issue in the assembly.""We have filed an FIR against Kunal Kamra for his comments against our leader and Maharashtra's DCM Eknath Shinde. We have demanded quick action against him. I want to tell him to apologize to Eknath Shinde within two days, otherwise, Shiv Sainiks will not let him move about freely in Mumbai,"" Patel said.""If he is seen anywhere in public, we will paint his face black... We will take up this issue in the assembly and request our state's home minister to order action against him as soon as possible,"" he added.Party leaders dismissed Kamra as a ""hired comedian"" making comments for money.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money. Let alone Maharashtra, Kunal Kamra cannot freely go anywhere in India; Shiv Sainiks will show him his place. We feel sorry for Sanjay Raut and Shiv Sena (UBT) that they have no party workers or leaders left to make comments on our leader, which is why they are hiring people like him (Kunal Kamra) for the job,"" Mhaske said.The opposition, particularly Shiv Sena (UBT), defended Kamra and condemned the attack. Aaditya Thackeray called the vandalism an act of cowardice by ""Mindhe's gang"" and questioned the state's law and order situation.""Mindhe's (read Shinde) coward gang breaks the comedy show stage where comedian Kunal Kamra put out a song on Eknath Mindhe, which was 100 percent true. Only an insecure coward would react to a song by someone,"" Shiv Sena-UBT leader and MLA Aaditya Thackeray said.Sena MP Sanjay Raut shared Kamra's video, praising it as ""Kunal Ka Kamal,"" while Priyanka Chaturvedi criticised the justification of violence over disagreement.","Comedian Kunal Kamra sparked controversy after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde.

House of Nagpur riots accused to be demolished today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-of-nagpur-riots-accused-to-be-demolished-today/articleshow/119399810.cms,"NAGPUR: The house of Fahim Khan, alleged Nagpur riots mastermind now in custody, is set to be demolished Monday after he failed to remove the purported illegal structure within a 24-hour civic deadline. The action loomed even as curfew was lifted Sunday from all areas scarred by the March 17 violence.The action by Nagpur Municipal Corporation against Khan's double-storied house in Sanjay Bagh Colony will be the first such razing of a riot accused's property by the civic body. It will unfold two days after CM Devendra Fadnavis asserted that ""bulldozers will run, if the law permits"". He was responding to a query on whether his BJP-led Mahayuti govt would follow UP CM Yogi Adityanath's model of delivering justice.The demolition will unfold months after the Supreme Court imposed a pan-India ban on "" bulldozer justice "".The SC last Nov had held that such demolition of a citizen's house without following due process of law, merely because the individual is a suspect or even a convict, will be ""totally unconstitutional"". The court laid down elaborate procedures for razing illegal structures and ruled that the state could not breach a family's right to shelter only because one of its members is accused of a heinous crime.The demolition of Khan's house is expected to begin around 10am on Monday with heavy police deployments. NMC had issued notice to Khan on March 21 saying the 86.48sqm house, registered in the name of his wife Zahirunnisa, was illegal.NMC officials inspected the house on March 20 and said it violated Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. The officials said no building plan was approved, making the structure unauthorised. Despite complaints from residents about the encroachment, civic authorities had not acted so far. TOI has a copy of the demolition notice.On Saturday, Nagpur police had sealed two shops after a probe found these were used by rioters linked to Khan's Minority Democratic Party (MDP).Meanwhile, curfew was lifted Sunday from riot-affected areas after a nearly week-long turbulence, a day after CM Fadnavis asserted that 80% of the city was unaffected by the March 17 flare-up. While the curbs were done away, security measures were retained in some sensitive pockets. The death of Irfan Ansari, a 38-year-old riot victim, in hospital on Saturday stoked security concerns. The curfew relief has coincided with festive mood setting in with Gudi Padwa and Eid later this month, followed by Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti in April.","Fahim Khan's double-storied house in Sanjay Bagh Colony will be the first such razing of a riot accused's property by the civic body.

Shiv Sena workers vandalize comedy venue

Political leaders' reactions

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske on Sunday issued a stern warning to stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a Mumbai comedy show .Subsequently, Shiv Sena members damaged the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar where the performance took place.During his performance at the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai, Kamra addressed the political division in Maharashtra. A viral video on X showed Kamra's subtle dig at Shinde's rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and the ensuing political developments.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter...everyone got confused,"" Kamra said.Kamra also sang a parody song with reference to Thane—Shinde's political bastion—labeling him a ""gaddar"" (traitor) without naming him.The video, uploaded by Kamra, went viral in no time, garnering over 360,000 views.Sena MP Naresh Mhaske from the Shinde group accused Kamra of being a paid performer hired by Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) to criticise Eknath Shinde.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money.

Kunal Kamra will get a befitting reply, and he will come and apologise for his mistake"", he added.Hours after the video came up, Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers vandalized the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar, where Kamra's show was recorded. Reports suggest that the workers smashed property and warned of further action if Kamra continued his criticism.Local police verified the incident and are probing the vandalism, but no formal complaints have been registered by the comedy club as yet.Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena UBT MP, publicly backed Kamra by sharing the comedian’s video and wrote, ""Kunal ki kamal, Jai Maharashtra,"" on X.Priyanka Chaturvedi, Shiv Sena UBT MP, also supported Kamra, referencing Voltaire in her defense of free speech. ""Dear Kunal, stand strong. The man and the gang you exposed will go after you... I will defend to death your right to speak your mind,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena, Shinde faction, also responded. Mhaske doubled down on his position, saying that Kamra would receive a ""befitting reply"" and would eventually apologize for his remarks.

CPM trolled as red display picture of party's Bengal unit turns blue on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpm-trolled-as-red-display-picture-of-partys-bengal-unit-turns-blue-on-social-media/articleshow/119398229.cms,"'It was just a change in the look of the logo': CPM scrambles to downplay controversy

KOLKATA: CPM is no stranger to political storms. But this time, it's a tempest of trolls. A change in the social media display picture of the party's Bengal unit - swapping the iconic red background for a blue sky and white clouds - has set off a social media frenzy, with netizens seeing shades of irony, humour, and even surrender in the move. For the once-dominant force in Bengal politics , the change is as striking as it is symbolic. The new backdrop - uncannily close to the favourite colours of CM Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress - has led to a digital avalanche of jibes, memes and one-liners.Firbe na aar se firbe na (It will not return), posted netizen Soumik Das, borrowing lyrics from a popular Bengali rock song. The message was clear: CPM, which governed Bengal from 1977 to 2011, is struggling to claw back into relevance.CPM's social media reach is still formidable. Its Instagram handle ""cpimwb"" has over 81,300 followers, while its Facebook page boasts 467,000. But the response to the new display picture has been more about ridicule than resonance - 1,100 comments, 448 shares, and a flood of snarky remarks. The party's electoral fortunes have been equally stark. Once a behemoth in Bengal, it won 26 assembly seats in 2016, clinging to 19.7% of the vote share. But by 2024, CPM had slumped to just 5.7% in Lok Sabha polls.Sensing the growing chatter, party members scrambled to downplay the controversy. ""It was just a change in the look of the logo,"" said CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty. ""We've changed it eight times in recent years. Our flag remains a vibrant hue of red. We are not wavering from our commitments to end exploitation.""CPM state panel member Satarup Ghosh was more blunt: ""We don't think the sky, or its allusion, is patented by Trinamool."" In fact, the change had served its purpose, he said. ""You don't see anything other than the hammer and sickle on Facebook now.""For a party whose identity has long been tied to its blood-red banner, the absence of even a speck of red in the new display picture is striking. The red flag, a symbol of socialist struggle since the French Revolution, was proudly adopted by CPM - its hammer and sickle etched in the imagination of leftist politics.But blogger Anirban Hati saw a deeper irony. He recalled how former Kerala CMs EK Nayanar and EMS Namboodiripad slammed author Arundhati Roy decades ago for describing a faded red flag in 'The God of Small Things'. ""Decades later, the Left has no hard-line left,"" Hati wrote, noting how Roy's metaphor now seems uncannily prescient.Netizen Sandip Ghosh had a more gastronomic take on the matter: ""The background fits Didi's favourite colour. Fish fry and mutton kasa will be on the menu again.""Whether the red will return - or continue fading into the blue - remains an open question. But for now, the trolls are having a field day.","A change in the social media display picture of the party's Bengal unit has set off a social media frenzy.

CBI closure reports in 2 cases tied to Rajput death filed in Patna, Mumbai

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Four-and-a half years after it began probing the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , the CBI is learned to have closed the case and given a clean chit to actor Rhea Chakraborty , bringing curtains on a case that had gripped the country, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14, 2020.The probe agency is learned to have filed a closure report in two of the cases it was investigating, sources said. While one case was filed in Aug 2021 in Patna by Rajput's father against Rhea, her kin and others, the other was filed in Sept by Rhea against Rajput's sister and doctor.The closure report in both was filed in a special Mumbai court, sources said.Rhea's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, ""Rhea Chakraborty had to undergo untold miseries and was behind bars for 27 days for no fault of hers until Justice Sarang V Kotwal released her on bail. I salute her and her family for having kept silent and yet suffered the inhuman treatment they were meted out. Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.""Rajput was found dead 6 days after his PR manager Disha Salian fell off the 14th floor of a Malad tower and died.Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14, 2020, six days after his PR manager Disha Salian died. Mumbai police , which first probed the case, termed it as a case of suspected suicide, although no suicide note had been found. The provisional post-mortem suggested the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Disha's father Satish Salian alleged his daughter was gangraped and murdered. He has filed a plea demanding a CBI probe into her death, alleging that Rajput was visibly frightened and repeatedly expressed fear that ""those people"" responsible for her death would not spare him and that he would be killed. He has said both deaths are interconnected and part of a larger conspiracy.The CBI FIR in Rajput's case named Rhea and her kin Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya and Showik apart from her associates Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The FIR, initially filed by Bihar police , had sections of IPC related to criminal conspiracy, abetment of suicide, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, theft, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation.After Rajput's cremation at Vile Parle's Pawan Hans crematorium, Mumbai police began their investigation, recording statements from film and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, Rajput's girlfriend Rhea, and his managerial staff. In July that year, producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali was questioned, stating he had offered Rajput four films, but eventually featured in none.Rhea, who confirmed being in a relationship with Rajput on Twitter (now X), demanded a CBI inquiry. Mumbai police also recorded statements of filmmaker Aditya Chopra and three psychiatrists.Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against Rhea in Patna on July 28, and a team of Bihar police reached Mumbai to probe the case.The Enforcement Directorate inquired about the money laundering angle in the case and questioned Rhea but they found no substance against her. Subsequently, the NCB initiated a probe against her along with others on allegations of procurement of drugs for Rajput which led to her arrest. In Aug 2021, the CBI filed an FIR against Rhea and others, and the ED too summoned her for questioning.An AIIMS forensic team was roped in by the CBI on Aug 22, and the ED unearthed a drug angle in the case, involving the Narcotics Control Bureau .In Sept 2021, Rhea filed an FIR against Rajput's sisters and doctor, which was transferred to the CBI as well.This is the second case which has been closed as well, sources said.In Oct, reports emerged that the AIIMS panel had dismissed the murder theory, although the CBI stated they were probing all angles.","CBI closes actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case, clears Rhea Chakraborty.

He had clearly said that the police fired shots, and those who died were killed by police bullets.""Asked what conversation he had with Zafar Ali before being taken away by police, Tahir Ali said, ""He told me, 'No problem, I am ready to go to jail. I will not back down from the truth'.""He accused the Sambhal administration of deliberately inciting public unrest. ""The authorities do not want the tension to ease. We are trying to restore peace, but all police officers and senior officials here are provoking further discord,"" he claimed.Earlier in the day, the Special Investigation Team of Sambhal police had taken Ali into custody to record his statement.The Mughal-era mosque has been at the center of a significant controversy following claims that it was built on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The violence during protests against a court-ordered survey of the mosque resulted in four fatalities and numerous injuries, including among police personnel.The November 24 incident led to widespread unrest, with protestors clashing with police, throwing stones, and setting vehicles ablaze. The police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd. In total, the SIT has filed a chargesheet exceeding 4,000 pages across six of the twelve cases related to this violence, naming 159 individuals as accused.The chargesheet also revealed that weapons recovered from the scene were manufactured in countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.Reports indicate that Ali was among the first to receive information about the survey, which sparked protests that escalated into violence as locals gathered outside the mosque.Since the initial outbreak of violence, Sambhal has remained relatively calm, with no further incidents reported. In anticipation of upcoming celebrations, including Holi, local authorities have maintained a heavy police presence and conducted flag marches to ensure public safety.During this period, residents celebrated Holi peacefully alongside Friday prayers at the mosque.Circle Officer Anuj Chowdhary had led a flag march along with other police personnel to ensure the law and order situation in the district before Holi. Other than police, paramilitary forces also conducted a flag march in Sambhal, whereas the administration is using drones for proper monitoring of the situation in the district.The act of whitewashing the Jama masjid, a regular affair was also done after a court order.Talking about the whitewashing on March 16, Zafar Ali stated that they will try to complete the whitewashing task as per the court orders. The Jama Masjid Sadar Chief stated that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has undertaken the work and appointed all labour.","Shahi Jama Masjid committee president Zafar Ali was arrested on Sunday in connection with the violence that erupted in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on November 24 last year. Ali's elder brother Tahir Ali alleged that the police were ""deliberately"" sending his sibling to jail before his testimony could be recorded.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119376022,imgsize-852768,width-400,resizemode-4/119376022.jpg"

Who was Rana Sanga?



NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday defended his party leader's "" Rana Sanga a traitor"" remark, saying that referring to a page in ""history should not be an issue"".A massive controversy erupted after SP Rajya Sabha MP Ramjilal Suman on March 21 called Rajput warrior Rana Sanga a ""traitor"" and Hindus his descendent.Attacking the rival BJP, Suman argued that ""if Muslims are called the descendants of Babur, then Hindus must be the descendants of traitor Rana Sanga"".During his speech in Parliament, Suman had said, ""Indian Muslims do not consider Babur as their idol. They follow Prophet Muhammad and the Sufi tradition. But I want to ask, who brought Babur here? It was Rana Sanga who invited Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodi.""So, if Muslims are called the descendants of Babur, then Hindus must be the descendants of traitor Rana Sanga. We criticise Babur, but why don't we criticise Rana Sanga?""As the BJP continued to mount an attack on the Samajwadi leader, Akhilesh Yadav came out in Suman's defence, saying: ""Everyone is flipping through the pages of history. Ask BJP leaders which pages they are turning. What are they debating? They want to talk about Aurangzeb.""""If Ramjilal Suman ji has referred to a page in history that contains certain facts, then what's the issue? We didn't write history 200 years ago,"" the SP chief said, according to news agency PTI.""If BJP continues to flip through history, people will also remember that during Chhatrapati Shivaji 's coronation, no one anointed him by hand. It is said that he was anointed using the toe of a left foot. Will the BJP condemn this today?"" he said.He further added: ""Galileo was punished for his scientific assertion, and centuries later, the Church apologised for its mistake. If the BJP respects Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will they apologise for the fact that he was anointed with a left foot toe?""Hitting back, BJP leader Amit Malviya said Yadav, ""who indulges in appeasement, is supporting his MP Ramji Lal for calling the great warrior Rana Sanga a traitor. This is an insult not only to the Rajput community but to the entire Hindu community"".""The distorted comments being made on the Maha Kumbh were also no exception but are an indication of the petty anti-Hindu mentality of the SP, due to which the people of Uttar Pradesh have pushed the SP to the lowest rung of the state's politics,"" he said.Rana Sanga (1472–1528), also known as Maharana Sangram Singh, was the Rajput ruler of Mewar and a prominent warrior king of medieval India. He united various Rajput clans to resist foreign invasions and expanded his kingdom significantly. Known for his bravery, he fought multiple battles, including against the Delhi Sultanate and the Lodis.His most famous battle was against Babur in 1527 at Khanwa, where he led a massive Rajput alliance but was ultimately defeated due to Babur's superior tactics and artillery. Despite his loss, Rana Sanga remains a symbol of Rajput valour and resistance against foreign rule in India.","Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday defended his party leader's "" Rana Sanga a traitor"" remark.

NEW DELHI: Aggrieved by the demolition of his house and shop, allegedly done after his 15-year-old son purportedly shouted an anti-India slogan in Maharashtra 's Sindhudurg district during the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy match, a man has moved Supreme Court claiming it was done in violation of the apex court's ruling against ' bulldozer justice '. The court is likely to hear his plea on Monday.The match was played between the two teams in Dubai on Feb 23, and an FIR was registered against the boy's family on the same night, with the complainant alleging he had shouted anti-India slogans during the match.

The authority demolished the petitioner's tin-shed shop and house on the alleged ground of it being an ""illegal structure"".Pleading the apex court to initiate contempt proceedings, the petitioner alleged that the action of the civic authorities was arbitrary, illegal and malafide, and done in violation of SC's direction issued in Nov last year in which the court had said demolition exercise cannot be undertaken as a punitive measure against any accused or convict. It had also laid down procedure to be followed by authorities before demolishing illegal construction and it included giving prior notice.","Kitabullah Hamidulla Khan, a 40-year-old scrap dealer, alleged people were mobilised by the local MLA, and local authority was pressured to undertake the demolition exercise.

UK issues new travel advice for citizens going to US

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents.

She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them.

I was. I was in Doha. I met with many of the Arab leaders at the Arab summit. I thought we had an acceptable deal. I even thought we had an approval from Hamas. Maybe that’s just me getting duped. I thought we were there, and evidently, we weren’t,” Witkoff told ‘Fox News Sunday,’ responding to a query about bringing hostages back to home and about the deal during his March 12 visit to Doha.The proposal aimed to extend the ceasefire through April 19, exchanging five living hostages for Palestinian security prisoners. Israel accepted the terms, offering to free 11 living hostages. However, Hamas maintained its stance on the original agreement's terms, which was supposed to begin its second phase at the beginning of March.For a month, though, Israel refused to enter talks on the specific terms of phase two, as the stage’s general framework requires it to fully withdraw from Gaza and agree to a permanent end of the war.In submitting his bridge proposal earlier this month, Witkoff accepted Israel’s aversion to phase two.Hamas offered to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the remains of four US-Israeli citizens on March 14, which Witkoff called the response a non-starter. The ceasefire collapsed after two months when Israel resumed military operations four days later.Witkoff emphasised US support for Israel , stating that Hamas had opportunities for demilitarisation and accepting the bridge proposal for a 40-50 day ceasefire. He remained open to future negotiations, noting that parties were still communicating despite renewed hostilities.“This is on Hamas. The United States stands with the State of Israel. That’s a 100% commitment,” Witkoff told Fox. “We’ve expressed that Hamas had every opportunity to demilitarize, to accept the bridging proposal that would have given us a 40- or 50-day ceasefire where we could have discussed demilitarization and a final truce. There were all kinds of opportunities to do that, and they elected not to.”“This (war) becomes the alternative, and it is unfortunate,” he added.The US announced significant airstrikes on March 15, reportedly killing senior Houthi leaders and 53 others according to rebel health authorities. The Houthis have continued their attacks on Israel since November 2023, following Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in 1,200 deaths and 251 hostages.Despite claiming to target Israeli-linked vessels, the Houthis have attacked ships with no Israeli connections. Their attacks paused during the January ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.","US special envoy Steve Witkoff said that Hamas might have ""duped"" him into thinking that they were interested in the bridge proposal.

Israel cabinet votes 'no confidence' in attorney general who opposed PM Netanyahu's dismissal of security chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-cabinet-votes-no-confidence-in-attorney-general-who-opposed-pm-netanyahus-dismissal-of-security-chief/articleshow/119401193.cms,"Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu and AG Gali Baharav-Miara

Why Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief

Israel's cabinet passed a vote of no confidence in attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara , on Sunday, days after the High Court of Justice, Israel's highest court, temporarily blocked the cabinet's dismissal of internal security head Ronen Bar over his failure to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas in Israel.Baharav-Miara had openly cautioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against trying to replace Bar, the director of Shin Bet , whose dismissal from service was the first in the agency's history.Ahead of the vote on Baharav-Miara, protesters held demonstrations outside the Knesset and the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem, leading to scuffles with police, according to news agency AFP.Netanyahu's office, citing a cabinet meeting agenda, had said the government would hold the vote on Baharav-Miara ""due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and its legal adviser"".The unprecedented moves to dismiss the Shin Bet chief and now the attorney general have widened divisions in Israel amid the resumption of its military operations in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.Netanyahu has cited an ""ongoing lack of trust"" in Bar, who is expected to testify on April 8. The Israeli premier has insisted repeatedly ""it is up to the government"" who will head the Shin Bet.However, critics see two main reasons behind Netanyahu moving against Bar.The first was the latter's criticism of the Israeli government over the security failure that allowed the Hamas attack on October 7, the deadliest day in the country's history. The second was Shin Bet's investigation of Netanyahu's close associates on suspicion of receiving money linked to Qatar.Netanyahu's office has dismissed such accusations as ""fake news"".Following the court's initial ruling on Bar, Baharav-Miara said Netanyahu cannot name a new internal security chief.""According to the decision of the Supreme Court, it is prohibited to take any action that harms the position of the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar. It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held,"" she said.","Israel's cabinet passed a vote of no confidence in attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara.

North Carolina wildfires continue to destroy buildings; mandatory evacuations issued

North Carolina issues 'Code Red,' signaling unhealthy air



Wildfires burn over 4,000 acres in North Carolina



South Carolina declares emergency



The devastating wildfire forced the public safety department to announce a mandatory evacuation in North Carolina's Polk County while South Carolina's governor has declared a state of emergency due to spreading fires.The North Carolina Department of Public Safety ordered mandatory evacuations at 8.20 pm Saturday for sections of Polk County, situated 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte.""Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,"" stated the agency via social media.A shelter has been established in Columbus, North Carolina, according to the public safety department.The North Carolina Forest Service reports three active fires in Polk County, with two major blazes covering 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) to 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Additional fires are burning in Burke, Madison, and Stokes counties, the latter bordering Virginia.Due to the three separate fires -- the Black Cove Fire , Deep Woods Fire and the Fish Hook Fire-- the North Carolina Division of Air Quality issued a ""Code Red"" alert signaling unhealthy air for Polk County, and a ""Code Orange"" in Rutherford County, signaling unhealthy air for people sensitive to smoke.Western North Carolina is still recovering from Hurricane Helene's September impact, which damaged Interstate 40's eastbound lanes and affected 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state roads and 7,000 private roads.Simultaneously, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service is managing a Wharton State Forest fire that began Saturday, consuming 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) by early Sunday. Firefighters have contained approximately half the blaze, as reported at 8 a.m. on their Facebook page.Officials evacuated two campgrounds. While 18 buildings were near the fire, the flames moved away from structures, avoiding residential evacuations. The fire's cause remains under investigation.Two major wildfires in Polk County, North Carolina, expanded significantly on Sunday, with both exceeding 2,000 acres and remaining uncontrolled.The North Carolina Forest Service identified four active fires in the county by Sunday evening.The two largest fires - Black Cove, which expanded to 2,076 acres, and Deep Wood, reaching 2,545 acres - remained completely uncontained.These fires were affecting timber areas across challenging steep terrain, spanning both state-owned and private properties within the Green River Gorge, according to the state's department of agriculture and consumer services.Approximately 250 firefighting staff from North Carolina and neighbouring states were actively working to protect residential areas and buildings from the advancing fires, as reported by the department.In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster declared an emergency on Saturday to combat the Table Rock Fire in Pickens County, which began in the Blue Ridge Mountains region.McMaster stated, ""As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilise resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,"" supporting Friday's statewide burning ban.Officials requested voluntary evacuations near Table Rock Mountain on Saturday. The Pickens County Sheriff's Office suspended operations Saturday evening, planning to resume Sunday with ground crews, helicopters, and air tankers. The 110-acre (45 hectares) fire prompted authorities to request avoiding state Highway 11.","North Carolina issues 'Code Red,' signaling unhealthy air.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Badar Khan Suri , an Indian post-doc fellow at Georgetown University who has been detained by immigration authorities for alleged pro-Hamas activism, saying he should not removed from the US pending the outcome of the legal challenge seeking his release.Virginia Eastern District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles did not rule on the merits of the deportation case itself but suggested Suri's habeas corpus needs to be heard first in an order stating he ""shall not be removed from the U.S unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.""Suri's attorney has said his client was abducted from his apartment in Rosslyn, Virginia, a suburb outside Washington DC, and is incarcerated in distant Louisiana, where the Syria-born Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has also been imprisoned at a different facility.Khalil's attorneys too are fighting his deportation, and after accusing authorities of moving their client to a more conservative jurisdiction (Louisiana is a deep red Republican state), they got the case transferred to New Jersey.The detentions follow a Trump crackdown on liberal campuses where student activists have been protesting and criticizing -- both directly and on social media -- U.S foreign policy with regards to the Israel-Palestinian issue.The Trump administration says foreign students, even if they have Green cards and valid visas, are violating terms of their stay with political activism that pose a threat to US national security. Administration officials have warned that many more foreign student activists will be identified and deported.Free speech advocates maintain the administration's actions are a violation of the First Amendment, even with regards to foreign scholars, with some recalling campus anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. “Badar Khan Suri’s detention is a clear violation of his constitutional rights, and he must be released,” Virginia Democrat lawmaker Don Beyer said Thursday, adding, “The ‘justification’ given for these violations of Mr. Suri’s right to due process is another violation of the Constitution: a blatant attack on the First Amendment.""The judicial interventions that are stalling the deportations has enraged President Trump, who says lawyers ""endlessly search"" for "" radical left judges "" to thwart the administration's effort to deport dangerous illegal immigrants, although the crackdown now targets even legal residents.According to a rough count by legal mavens, Out of 679 active federal district court judges, 384 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 257 appointed by Republican presidents. In the Appeals Court, out of 179 active judges, 88 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 89 were appointed by Republican presidents. Six of the nine Supreme Court judges have been appointed by Republican Presidents, including three by Trump.But the US President and his acolytes, including Elon Musk, are still unhappy and want Roberts to sign off on moves to impeach liberal justices balking at an imperial presidency they are aiming for, where the President's authority is unquestioned. Roberts, who has suggested the administration can go through with the appeals process rather than target the judges.In a series of posts, Trump raged that ""Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!""""These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,"" Trump fumed, adding that ""No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.""Judges are now being openly identified as ""Obama judges"" ""Biden judges"" ""Bush judges"" etc depending on who and in what year they were appointed. Chief Justice John Roberts himself --- a Conservative Republican Bush appointee -- is under attack from MAGA for not consistently ruling in favor of Trump and resisting the move to impeach liberal judges.""If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!""

Senator Bernie Sanders grew visibly agitated and abruptly ended an interview after being asked whether his progressive ally, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , should run for the Senate.During a pre-taped segment for ABC's This Week , host Jonathan Karl questioned the Vermont senator about Ocasio-Cortez's future, asking, ""Would you like to see her join you in the Senate?""

OK, Jonathan, thanks,"" Sanders responded tersely before standing up abruptly and walking off camera.Karl attempted to continue the interview, calling after Sanders, ""Wait, I got one more — I got one more.

Trump now broadens campaign of retaliation against lawyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-now-broadens-campaign-of-retaliation-against-lawyers/articleshow/119389910.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump broadened his campaign of retaliation against lawyers he dislikes with a new memorandum that threatens to use govt power to punish any law firms that, in his view, unfairly challenge his administration. The memorandum directs the heads of the justice and homeland security departments to ""seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the USs"" or in matters that come before federal agencies.Trump issued the order late on Friday night, after a tumultuous week for the American legal community in which one of the country's premier firms, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, struck a deal with the White House to spare the company from a punitive decree issued by Trump the previous week.Vanita Gupta, who as a civil rights lawyer and a former justice department official has both sued the govt and defended it in court, said Trump's memo ""attacks the very foundations of our legal system by threatening and intimidating litigants who aim to hold our govt accountable to the law and the constitution.""In response to criticism of the memo, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said, ""President Trump is delivering on his promise to ensure the judicial system is no longer weaponised against the American people. President Trump's only retribution is success and historic achievements for the American people.""The president has long complained that Democratic-leaning lawyers and law firms have pursued what he calls ""lawfare"" in the form of investigations and lawsuits against him and his allies that he claims are motivated by politics. Since being sworn into office, he has targeted three firms, but the new memo seems to threaten similar punishment for any firm that raises his ire or any lawyer who does.After Trump issued an order suspending security clearances for Paul Weiss lawyers, and sharply limiting their employees from entering govt buildings or getting govt jobs, the firm agreed to a series of commitments to get the president to cancel the order. As part of the deal, the firm said it would provide $40 million in legal services to causes Trump has championed, including his task force to combat antisemitism. Perkins Coie, another firm targeted by Trump, chose a different tack - suing him in federal court and getting a temporary restraining order against him.Trump's attacks on law firms, and Paul Weiss' decision to cut a deal rather than fight it out in court, have sent shock waves through the legal community. The sweeping nature of Trump's latest demand comes as he has also stepped up his public attacks on judges and the notion that the courts can tell him what to do or not do.","President Donald Trump threatens to use govt power to punish any law firms that, in his view, unfairly challenge his administration.

OTTAWA: New Canadian PM Mark Carney Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who ""wants to break us so America can own us"".The comments showed the extent to which relations between the US and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.Although the next election was not due until Oct 20, Carney is hoping to capitalise on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal party since Jan, when Trump began threatening Canada and former PM Justin Trudeau announced his resignation. Upon being sworn in as PM on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.""We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,"" Carney said after the governor general approved his request for an election.

'These people have no sense of humour': Tim Walz backtracks on Tesla's falling stock jab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/these-people-have-no-sense-of-humour-tim-walz-backtracks-on-teslas-falling-stock-jab/articleshow/119387642.cms,"File photo of Minnesota governor Tim Walz (Pic credit: AP)

Minnesota governor Tim Walz attempted to downplay his recent remarks about Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk , saying his comments were meant as a joke but standing by his criticism of the billionaire.Speaking at a town hall in Rochester, Minnesota, on Saturday, Walz acknowledged his previous jab at Tesla's plummeting stock price but claimed it was made in jest.""This guy bugs me in a way that's probably unhealthy,"" Walz said of Musk. ""I have to be careful about being a smart–. I was making a joke. These people have no sense of humour. They are the most literal people.""The controversy began earlier in the week when Walz, during an event in Wisconsin, mocked Tesla's stock decline.""Some of you know this. On the iPhone, they've got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day—$225 and dropping,"" Walz said. ""And if you own one, we're not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off.""Tesla shares have plunged 41.4% year-to-date, sparking concerns among investors.Beyond the stock market, Walz also took aim at Musk's involvement in the department of government efficiency (DOGE), an initiative focused on reducing the federal workforce as a cost-cutting measure under US President Donald Trump 's administration.""They're all butthurt about the Tesla thing, but they don't care about the disrespect they have shown to employees at the Minneapolis VA who care for our veterans, and they fire them. They don't care,"" Walz said.He continued his critique of Musk , contrasting the billionaire's wealth with what he sees as a lack of generosity.""Maybe it's just me. If I'm the richest man in the world, I'm like out on the streets handing out money,"" Walz said. ""It'd be fun as hell just to help people out. Go help people out. Not this guy.""Walz has a history of calling out Musk, previously referring to him as a ""knucklehead."" His latest remarks come amid growing criticism of Musk's political influence and Tesla's financial struggles.","Minnesota governor Tim Walz attempted to downplay his recent remarks about Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk.
