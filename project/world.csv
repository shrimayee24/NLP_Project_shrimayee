Mufti Shah Mir , accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday night by unidentified gunmen in Turbat, Balochistan Mir, known to be involved in human trafficking , was leaving the local mosque after Taraweeh (night) prayers when bikers ambushed him and shot him multiple times at point-blank range. According to a report in Dawn, Mir was immediately shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Mir, a human and arms trafficker, operated under the cover of a mufti (scholar) and was a member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist political party.Sources said he was an important conduit linked with ISI-led death squads and played a significant role in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of numerous Baloch youths. He was also instrumental in spreading religious extremism in Balochistan.In March 2016, Jadhav was abducted by a group led by Mullah Omar Irani of Jaish al-Adl from the Iran-Pakistan border and handed over to the Pakistan army through several intermediaries, including Mir. Irani was also killed, along with his two sons, in the same area (Turbat) in Nov 2020, allegedly by ISI.Mir is also suspected to have been gunned down by ISI operatives in what is believed to be an internal conflict that has been brewing for some time. Last week, two others of JUI-F -- Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah -- were shot dead by bike-borne assailants in what the local police described as targeted killings. The security guard of one also sustained bullet injuries. Mir had also survived two attempts on his life last year and had recently restricted his movements. ""He was providing intelligence about Baloch fighters to the Pak army. In 2023, a teacher named Abdul Rauf was murdered over alleged blasphemy in Turbat. The killing was carried out on the instructions of Mir,"" a source informed.Jadhav, who was running a business in Chabahar (Iran) after a premature retirement from the Navy, was abducted and incarcerated on false charges in Pakistan. He was intercepted in the Chaman area of Balochistan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on March 3, 2016. In April 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death, charging him with involvement in espionage and sabotage activities. India condemned the verdict as a premeditated murder. The International Court of Justice stayed the execution while asking the Pakistan government to review the conviction process besides grant consular access to India.","Mufti Shah Mir, accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday.

INDORE: Rumours of buried treasure, allegedly fuelled by the recent movie 'Chhava', have triggered a digging frenzy around the famed Asirgarh Fort in MP's Burhanpur , which has no dearth of legends associated with it.Hundreds of villagers, armed with torchlights and some even carrying metal detectors, are digging up the fields around the fort in the hope of finding Mughal-era gold.

Kuki Zo Council

calls indefinite bandh, Meiteis slam blockade

Guwahati: A 30-year-old man was killed in police firing and more than 20 others, mostly women, were wounded Saturday as clashes erupted between Kuki demonstrators and security forces in Manipur's Kangpokpi district. The violence broke out during protests against Centre's move to resume free movement across the strife-torn state.The clashes erupted in Kuki-dominated areas of Gamgiphai, Motbung, and Keithelmanbi when demonstrators attempted to block vehicles, including a state transport bus travelling from Imphal to Senapati district. Protesters set at least two vehicles on fire.The situation remains tense, with security forces on high alert in the region.Home minister Amit Shah had earlier directed state authorities to ensure free movement on all roads in Manipur, a move aimed at bridging the divide between Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. Under heavy security escort, the state resumed inter-district govt bus services Saturday, but officials reported little participation.The unrest extended to the Meitei-dominated valley, where security forces halted a peace march by Federation of Civil Society (FOCS) at Sekmai, before it could reach Kangpokpi. “If govt is not in a position to allow free movement of the public, what is the need for making the announcement?” said FOCS president T Manihar.Kuki-Zo Council opposed the push for unrestricted movement, warning it could lead to violence. “The actions of state govt to send Meitei people into Kuki-Zo areas, despite ample warnings against such movements, have escalated tensions in the region,” it said. Declaring an indefinite shutdown across all Kuki-Zo areas, effective from Saturday midnight, the council said it does not oppose the free movement of essential commodities but rejects unrestricted travel from the valley. Meitei Heritage Society called the blockade an act of defiance.","Violence broke out during protests against Centre's move to resume free movement across the strife-torn state.

Who was Brad Sigmon? First US prisoner executed by firing squad in 15 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-brad-sigmon-first-us-prisoner-executed-by-firing-squad-in-15-years/articleshow/118797457.cms,"Picture source: The Guardian

Brad Sigmon death: South Carolina man executed by firing squad

Who Was Brad Sigmon?

Sigmon killed David and Gladys Larke, his ex-girlfriend’s parents, with a baseball bat in their Greenville County home in 2001.

He planned to kidnap his ex-girlfriend, Becky Barbare, and then kill both her and himself



On the night of the murders, he had been smoking crack cocaine and drinking. He told a friend he would “get Becky for leaving him” and “tie her parents up,” according to court records.

He was sentenced to death in 2002.

Sigmon was the oldest of the 46 inmates executed in South Carolina since the death penalty resumed in the US in 1976.

Brad Sigmon , a South Carolina man, was executed by firing squad on Friday, becoming the first US prisoner in 15 years to be put to death by this method.Three volunteer prison staff members fired rifles to execute Brad Sigmon, 67, who was later pronounced dead.Sigmon opted for the firing squad over the electric chair or lethal injection. According to news agency Associated Press, his lawyers argued that he feared the electric chair would ""cook him alive"" and that a lethal injection of pentobarbital could cause fluid and blood to rush into his lungs, effectively drowning him.South Carolina keeps the details of its lethal injection method confidential.

Errol Musk on having child with Elon: 'Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to say no',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/errol-musk-on-having-child-with-elon-any-woman-with-slight-brain-would-be-mad-to-say-no-ashley-st-clair/articleshow/118807869.cms,"Errol on St. Clair: ‘A little crazy’ or the opportunity of a lifetime?

No clarifications, just more speculation

Errol’s contradictions: Defending Elon while taking shots at his exes

Errol Musk , never one to hold back, has weighed in on the swirling controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. While making it abundantly clear that he has no insider knowledge, Errol still had plenty to say—dropping his usual mix of blunt opinions and offbeat musings.Sitting in his sprawling South African home, surrounded by chaotic domesticity, Errol made no effort to soften his words about the 26-year-old right-wing influencer. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail. “If it turns out not to be true, she would be a little crazy, don’t you think?”But in the next breath, his tone shifted. “Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to turn down the opportunity if she were to be offered a child with Elon,” he said as quoted by the Daily Mail, an eyebrow-raising remark that seemed both a backhanded compliment and a subtle dig at St. Clair’s credibility.Despite his sharp words, Errol refused to take a definitive stance on whether St. Clair was telling the truth. When pressed, he simply let his earlier statements hang in the air, leaving the speculation to simmer.His comments stand in contrast to his past critiques of Elon as a father. Just weeks ago, Errol publicly accused his billionaire son of being a neglectful parent, particularly in the wake of the tragic loss of Elon’s first child, Nevada, in 2002. But in this latest conversation, his tone seemed more conciliatory.Though Errol has often been openly critical of Elon, he appears to have drawn the line at St. Clair’s allegations. In fact, his words hinted at an uncharacteristic moment of defense for his son. “I think Elon is a good father. He is trying to be,” he said. “No one sets out to be a bad father. It’s very difficult.”Yet, true to form, his defenses often come with a sting. When the subject turned to Elon’s other exes—particularly Grimes—Errol was less forgiving. “She is nice, an attractive girl in some ways... She is a little nuts,” he quipped, before attributing the couple’s children’s “very weird” names solely to the musician. “It’s not Elon’s work. He was trying to make her happy.”","Errol Musk has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said.

More than 80 Afghan women who fled Taliban rule to continue their education in Oman now face imminent deportation after the Trump administration abruptly cut funding for their scholarships.The US Agency for International Development (USAID) had been supporting their studies, but a funding freeze ordered by President Trump in January led to the termination of their scholarships, leaving them with no options but to return to Afghanistan.The students, who had been pursuing graduate and post-graduate degrees under the Women’s Scholarship Endowment (WSE) programme, were informed last week that their funding had been discontinued, reported BBC.Emails sent to the students confirmed that their scholarships had been terminated, citing the end of the USAID programme. The emails also referenced travel arrangements back to Afghanistan, sparking fear among the women.The Trump administration’s decision to freeze foreign aid has led to the closure of multiple humanitarian programmes worldwide, despite facing legal challenges. The affected Afghan students have pleaded with the international community for urgent intervention, seeking protection, financial assistance, and resettlement in a safe country where they can complete their education.The US State Department has yet to respond to requests for comment, and the USAID website’s media contact page remains offline.Since returning to power nearly four years ago, the Taliban has imposed strict restrictions on women, including banning them from higher education. These women, most in their 20s, had originally secured scholarships in 2021 before the Taliban takeover.

Xavier Worthy Avoids Charges Following Arrest in Texas



Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy will not be facing any charges following his recent arrest in Williamson County, Texas. Worthy was taken into custody on Friday under allegations of assault against a family or household member, specifically by impeding their breathing or circulation. However, after further review, the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office has decided not to proceed with the case at this time.The Austin American-Statesman reported late Saturday that District Attorney Shawn Dick made the decision after speaking with multiple witnesses. He confirmed that Worthy and his legal team were fully cooperating with the authorities as the investigation continued.“After further investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office and further discussion with a third-party witness, Mr. Worthy and his attorneys, this case is being declined at this time pending completion of the investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff's Office,"" Dick emailed the Statesman.He also clarified that the case could be revisited if additional evidence emerged. ""Mr. Worthy and his lawyers are fully cooperating with this investigation. We will continue to evaluate the case. As is our practice with all declines, should you develop additional information indicative of probable cause in this case, our office will consider that information and may present the case at that time to a Williamson County Grand Jury.”Worthy, who was arrested in Georgetown, Texas, was released from custody on Saturday following the DA’s decision.Shortly before the DA’s announcement, Worthy’s attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, released a statement strongly refuting the claims made against their client.""We are aware of the allegation that led to Mr. Worthy's arrest,"" the statement read. ""... The complainant was recently asked to vacate Mr. Worthy's residence upon discovery of her infidelity. She has refused to do so and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy.""The legal team’s remarks indicate that Worthy was dealing with a personal dispute that escalated into a legal matter. The attorneys asserted that the allegations were motivated by personal grievances rather than actual wrongdoing.The 21-year-old wide receiver was selected by Kansas City with the No. 28 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft after an impressive college career at the University of Texas. In his rookie season, he made an immediate impact, leading the Chiefs' receiving corps with 59 receptions for 638 yards and six touchdowns.

KOPPAL: Two men were arrested Saturday for the rape of a 27-year-old Israeli tourist and her female homestay host as well as the murder of an Odia tourist.The incident took place on Thursday night near Sanapur Lake, Gangavathi, Koppal, about 25 km from the Unesco world heritage site of Hampi. The arrested suspects are Mallesh alias Handi Mallesh, 22, and Kameshwar Rao, 21, both residents of Gangavathi taluk.""One more suspect is still absconding, but we have strong leads on his whereabouts,"" Koppal SP Ram L Arasiddi said. According to the FIR, the attack occurred late on March 6 when two women and three men, all tourists, went stargazing near the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal. They were playing a guitar and listening to music on the canal bank. The five had met at the homestay.Around 11 pm, the three suspects, who had been drinking at a bar in Sanapur town, approached them on a motorcycle, initially asking for petrol money. The tourists gave them Rs 20, but the men demanded Rs 100. When the tourists refused, the situation turned violent, with the suspects hurling abuses that soon escalated into a violent altercation.As the three male tourists-Daniel Pitas, 23, from the USA, Pankaj Amrit Rao Patil, 43, from Nashik, and Bibash, 26, from Odisha-tried to intervene, the attackers pushed the three tourists into the canal. While Pitas and Patil swam back to safety, Bibash's body was found early Saturday in the canal around 2km from the spot.Two of the attackers then held the homestay owner by the throat before sexually assaulting her. Another suspect raped the Israeli woman. The attackers also robbed the survivors, snatching two cellphones and Rs 9,500 in cash before fleeing the scene.After about three hours of the nightmare, the survivors managed to reach Gangavathi Rural police station at 5am Friday to report the crime. They were immediately admitted to the sub-divisional hospital, while police launched investigation, deploying dog squads and forensic teams.The complainant informed police that the attackers spoke in Kannada and Telugu. The survivors have reportedly identified the arrested suspects. Their arrests followed an extensive operation involving multiple police teams, forensic experts, and technical surveillance.The attack has sparked outrage, raising concerns over the safety of tourists at Hampi and its surrounding areas. Chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar have promised a thorough probe and justice to the survivors.","Incident took place near Sanapur Lake, Gangavathi, Koppal, about 25 km from Unesco world heritage site of Hampi.

Amid rising tariff dispute , US President Donald Trump reportedly questioned the legitimacy of the US-Canada border treaty and suggested revising the boundary during a conversation with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, according to the New York Times.Citing sources familiar with the discussion, the report mentioned that in a February 3 call, Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the 1908 border treaty and raised concerns over shared water agreements.He also voiced frustration over trade issues, including Canada's protected dairy sector, banking regulations, and consumption taxes that he claims put American goods at a disadvantage.Canada PM Trudeau, responding to the tariff measures, dismissed Trump’s justification as ""completely bogus"" and accused him of seeking to weaken Canada’s economy for potential annexation.The report further highlighted Trump’s push to reconsider agreements governing shared lakes and rivers, as well as his interest in removing Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance . He also explored the possibility of withdrawing from bilateral military agreements, including NORAD.While secretary of state Marco Rubio has downplayed concerns over military cooperation, Canadian officials remain deeply unsettled, viewing the administration’s actions as a shift in US-Canada relations rather than empty threats.","US President Donald Trump reportedly questioned the legitimacy of the US-Canada border treaty.

A senior Hamas leader has confirmed that the group is engaged in direct talks with the United States, signalling a major shift in American policy. However, he also accused US President Donald Trump of double standards in his approach to the conflict.Mushir al-Masri , a senior Hamas official, told CNN that discussions with US representatives centred on “achieving stability, ending the war, and stopping aggression against the Palestinian people.” He insisted that long-term peace could only be achieved through an agreement with Hamas.Since the October 7 attacks, Israel has refused to engage with Hamas, vowing to eliminate the group. Following reports of US-Hamas talks, Israel reiterated its position to Washington but withheld further details.Hamas has linked the release of American and Israeli hostages to negotiations for a second-phase ceasefire. The group is believed to be holding one living American hostage, Edan Alexander, along with four deceased Americans. Additionally, around 12 dual US-Israeli nationals are thought to be in captivity.Masri criticised Trump for focusing solely on Israeli hostages while ignoring nearly 10,000 Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. He accused Washington of siding with Israel rather than acting as a neutral mediator.Despite the ongoing talks, Trump has maintained a hardline stance against Hamas. On Thursday, he wrote on Truth Social that the group must release all hostages “or there will be hell to pay.” US envoy Steve Witkoff also hinted at potential American military action in Gaza, stating, “Some action will be taken” if Hamas does not comply.Masri dismissed these warnings as attempts to justify further Israeli military action in Gaza. He insisted that intimidation tactics would fail and warned against efforts to forcibly displace Gaza’s population.Trump has previously suggested that Gazans should leave the territory so that the US could take control and transform it into a Middle Eastern “riviera.”","Mushir al-Masri, a senior Hamas official, told CNN that discussions with US representatives centred on “achieving stability, ending the war, and stopping aggression against the Palestinian people” He insisted that long-term peace could only be achieved through an agreement with Hamas.

Canada’s political shift amid rising US tensions

Who is Mark Carney?

What’s next for Canada?

Canada is set to choose a new leader as it grapples with escalating tensions with the United States, fueled by President Donald Trump’s trade war and provocative remarks about annexing the country. Mark Carney , a seasoned central banker with a reputation for crisis management, is emerging as the frontrunner to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when the Liberal Party announces its leadership decision on Sunday, reported AP.Trudeau’s decision to step down, following declining approval ratings due to economic pressures and surging immigration, has transformed the upcoming leadership vote into a referendum on Canada’s ability to navigate its increasingly volatile relationship with Washington.Trump’s aggressive trade policies and his rhetoric about making Canada the “51st state” have stoked nationalist sentiment, with Canadians booing the U.S. anthem at sporting events and boycotting American goods. The backlash has given the governing Liberals a boost in the polls ahead of an anticipated snap election.With decades of stable US-Canada relations now in question, the race to succeed Trudeau has focused on who is best equipped to handle the growing economic and diplomatic threats from Washington.A former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney, 59, has built a reputation as a steady economic hand during times of crisis. His leadership during the 2008 financial meltdown helped Canada weather the storm better than many other nations, earning him international acclaim.Carney was the first central banker to provide clear guidance on interest rates, a move that reassured businesses and households. His ability to communicate complex financial policies in simple terms made him a trusted figure in economic circles.Since entering the leadership race in January, Carney has gained momentum with endorsements from Cabinet ministers and Liberal MPs, solidifying his status as the frontrunner. His main rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland , resigned from Trudeau’s government in December after a falling out with the prime minister, making her a weakened contender.The Liberal leadership vote, decided by roughly 140,000 party members, will take place in a closed-door ballot, with the winner expected to be announced on Sunday. A snap election could follow almost immediately, either triggered by the new Liberal leader or forced by a no-confidence vote in Parliament.Daniel Béland, a political scientist at McGill University, said Carney’s credentials and measured approach offer stability at a time when Trump is actively challenging Canada’s economy and sovereignty.Carney’s opponent in the upcoming election is likely to be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , a fiery populist who echoes Trump’s rhetoric. Poilievre, 45, has built a following with his “Canada First” platform, attacks on the media, and promises to defund the national broadcaster.While Poilievre called on Trump last week to stop his “monthly melodrama” over Canada, his political style could alienate voters looking for steady leadership amid uncertainty.With tensions rising and an election imminent, Canada’s next leader will face a defining test in managing the country’s most important but increasingly strained relationship—its ties with the United States.","Mark Carney, a seasoned central banker with a reputation for crisis management, is emerging as the frontrunner to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

A fear that 'might be overstated'

Political crossfire

ICE cracks down on families

A federal judge has struck down Denver Public Schools ' attempt to stop immigration authorities from making arrests on school grounds, delivering a victory for the Trump administration as it intensifies deportation efforts.The case, filed by Denver Public Schools against the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, challenged the administration’s reversal of a 2021 Biden-era policy that shielded schools and other sensitive locations from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The school district argued that the new policy had instilled fear among students, leading to a decline in attendance and forcing schools to divert resources to counter the impact.But US District Judge Daniel Domenico, a Trump appointee, dismissed the concerns, ruling that Denver schools failed to prove that declining student attendance was directly linked to the policy change. He also denied a request for a nationwide injunction that would have reinstated protections.Domenico noted that Denver schools had not actually experienced any raids and pointed out that ICE agents still require supervisory approval to conduct arrests at sensitive locations. The ruling echoed the administration’s stance that fears over school raids might be exaggerated.“The fear over the new rules, as well as the belief that the old rules provided protection to schools, both seem to be overstated,” Domenico stated.Denver Public Schools, which serves over 90,000 students—including 4,000 immigrants—expressed disappointment, arguing that the lawsuit at least brought transparency to the administration’s policies.The ruling comes amid broader tensions between Republican-led immigration crackdowns and sanctuary city policies. Just days before, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and other Democratic city leaders faced Republican scrutiny in Congress over their handling of immigration and crime.As deportation efforts ramp up, ICE has resumed detaining families with deportation orders, holding parents and children in Texas facilities. The agency is also conducting interior enforcement, arresting migrants who had crossed years ago but now face final removal orders. With over 1.4 million individuals on ICE’s docket, the administration is accelerating removals at a scale not seen in years.Denver, a city that has seen an influx of nearly 43,000 migrants from the southern border, now finds itself at the center of an intensifying national debate—one that pits local education concerns against federal immigration enforcement in a fight far from over.","Denver Public Schools challenged the administration's reversal of a 2021 Biden- era policy that shielded schools from ICE raids.

He entered a judgment of more than $24 billion that Missouri officials vowed to enforce by seizing Chinese assets.The lawsuit, filed by the Missouri attorney general 's office in April 2020, during the early months of the pandemic, accused the Chinese government of withholding information about the existence and spread of the virus and then of cutting off the supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, from the rest of the world. China did not respond to the allegations in court, and officials at the country's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.In his ruling, Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. wrote that ""China was misleading the world about the dangers and scope of the Covid-19 pandemic"" and had ""engaged in monopolistic actions to hoard PPE."" Those actions, he said, hampered the early response to the pandemic in the United States and made it impossible to purchase enough equipment for medical providers responding to the virus.Limbaugh, of US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, imposed the judgment against China, its governing Communist Party, local governments in China, as well as a health agency and a laboratory in the country.Missouri's attorney general, Andrew Bailey, said in a statement that the ruling held China accountable for its actions.""China refused to show up to court, but that doesn't mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation,"" said Bailey, a Republican. ""We intend to collect every penny by seizing Chinese-owned assets, including Missouri farmland.""Limbaugh, who was appointed by President George W Bush, initially dismissed Missouri's lawsuit. But the case was returned to him by an appellate court, and he held a bench trial in January at the federal courthouse in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. No one argued on behalf of China at the hearing.In 2020, shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Chinese officials disputed its legitimacy. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said at the time that the suit was ""very absurd"" and ""has no factual and legal basis at all.""But Limbaugh said Missouri's lawyers showed that China knew that the virus was spreading -- and that it was spreading from person to person -- long before it shared that information with the world. He also said Missouri showed that China took steps to nationalize American factories in China to produce protective equipment, which limited the supply available for export and drove up prices in places like Missouri. The judge noted that Covid-19 was the third-leading cause of death in Missouri in 2020 and 2021.Sen. Eric Schmitt, who was Missouri's attorney general when the lawsuit was filed, celebrated the judgment on social media Friday.""When I was AG in Missouri,"" wrote Schmitt, a Republican, ""I sued China for unleashing Covid on the world."" He added that ""Missouri can now seize assets.""","Missouri's attorney general vows to seize Chinese assets. A federal judge finds the Chinese government responsible for covering up the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. China did not respond to the allegations in court, and officials at the country's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118809894,imgsize-648815,width-400,resizemode-4/118809894.jpg"

Peshawar Shooting Incident: Pakistani man kills WhatsApp group admin in anger after being removed from chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-man-kills-whatsapp-group-admin-in-anger-after-being-removed-from-chat/articleshow/118803475.cms,"-

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders. Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

Even Imran Khan's wife has been denied meetings with him twice, and no explanation is being given,""he added.PTI has filed a contempt of court petition over the issue, but meetings continue to be blocked.Concerns have also been raised about Khan’s well-being, as the information secretary said that Khan has been denied medical consultations with his doctor. Additionally, PTI leaders have expressed frustration over the jail authorities withholding Khan’s books and newspapers.These claims could not be verified. Imran Khan has been behind bars since his arrest on August 5, 2023.","Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in a death cell at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) claimed on Monday.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.
