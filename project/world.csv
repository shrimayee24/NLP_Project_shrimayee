BHOPAL: The two-year-old tigress reintroduced into the wild at Satpura Tiger Reserve (STR) in Narmadapuram district of Madhya Pradesh was found dead on Friday.The tigress, raised in captivity after being rescued as a cub, was released with a radio collar on June 20th. Park officials noticed a lack of movement in the radio collar signal on July 11, and patrolling elephants later located her carcass.An autopsy was conducted, but the cause of death is still under investigation.Initial assessment suggests injuries from territorial fights. Tissue samples are being analysed for more details. A photo released by the department showed the decomposed body.STR field director L Krishnamurthy said the death was apparently due to a territorial war with another tiger.Officials claim that a fresh investigation will focus on determining the cause of death and identifying any shortcomings in the reintroduction protocols, if any.On August 25, 2022, a six-month-old cub fell into a well in a Seoni village. The Pench Tiger Reserve Rescue team rescued the cub, which had sustained serious injuries, including a prolapsed rectum and hairline fractures.The cub had received extensive treatment at the Van Vihar Wildlife Hospital, said the officer. Following a successful recovery, the cub was transferred to a special rewilding enclosure at Malini in Satpura Tiger Reserve on November 2, 2022. Here, the cub underwent a training program to regain its natural instincts for hunting and survival in the wild.The program began with a diet of chopped meat and medication, gradually progressing to live prey as the cub's strength and hunting skills improved. Eventually, the cub was able to take down small spotted deer, then graduating to larger prey as its skills matured, officials had informed. Throughout the rewilding process, care was taken to avoid human contact and habituation, ensuring the cub's successful reintegration into the wild.After demonstrating its ability to hunt and survive independently, the tigress, as she matured, was released into a designated area with ample prey and suitable habitat. To ensure the tigress' continued well-being, she was fitted with a radio collar for satellite tracking. A dedicated team was monitoring her movements.","The tigress, raised in captivity after being rescued as a cub, was released with a radio collar on June 20th.

Judge Marlowe Sommer stated, ""The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceedings. If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith it certainly comes so near to bad faith to show signs of scorching.""The pivotal evidence that led to the case's dismissal was revealed during the second day of testimony on Thursday. It involved ammunition brought to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office in March by a man claiming it could be related to Hutchins' death. Prosecutors deemed the ammo irrelevant, while Baldwin's lawyers accused them of ""burying"" it. The judge's decision concludes the nearly three-year legal ordeal for the 66-year-old actor, whose career had been put into question.District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies expressed disappointment that the case did not reach the jury. Baldwin and other producers still face civil lawsuits from Hutchins' family.

Her attorney, Jason Bowles, plans to file a motion to dismiss her case as well.The trial had only just begun when it was brought to an abrupt end. Prosecutors had barely started presenting their case, and no eyewitnesses from the set had testified yet. The judge had dealt a significant blow to the prosecution's case on the eve of the trial by ruling that Baldwin's role as a producer on the film was irrelevant and had to be excluded. Despite this setback, prosecutors proceeded, portraying Baldwin as a reckless performer who disregarded basic gun safety rules.Baldwin's attorney argued that he acted as any actor would on the ""Rust"" set and that necessary safety measures should have been taken before a gun reaches a performer's hand.","Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer based her decision on the misconduct of police and prosecutors.

The remaining are still struggling to get their dues,"" said activist Prafulla Samantara.A four-member delegation submitted a report on 'Displacement and Human Rights Violations- The Odisha Story' before the governor.It was prepared by the jury members headed by Manoranjan Mohanty, a retired professor of Delhi University, after conducting regional public hearings with displaced people of Odisha.In the recommendation part of the report, the jury members suggested forming a statutory body like the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to hear the grievances of displaced people. It can be called the National Commission on the Rights of Displaced People.Mohanty said it can be created by an Act of Parliament at the Centre, having branches in all the states of the country. This Commission will function like the NHRC, National Commission for Women, and the ST and SC Commissions. It should have the legal authority to enforce its recommendations in letter and spirit, he added.He said the Commission would be assigned to act as a grievance redressal mechanism for people who are already displaced and affected by the projects dating from the time of India’s independence. It will enumerate the number of persons displaced by development projects from 1947 onwards and publish a yearly status report on persons displaced from different projects, he added.The Commission will monitor the proper implementation of different legislations dealing with the displacement of people. ""The major problem of the displaced people is that they do not have any constitutional redressal forum to get justice. Tribal communities are more vulnerable to this crisis,"" said Samantara.He said many people do not get proper compensation and rehabilitation facilities.

"Russian assassination plots against those supporting Ukraine uncovered in Europe, official says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-assassination-plots-against-those-supporting-ukraine-uncovered-in-europe-official-says/articleshow/111703277.cms,"WASHINGTON: Western intelligence agencies have uncovered Russian plots to carry out assassinations, arson and other sabotage in Europe against companies and people linked to support for Ukraine 's military - one of the most serious being a plan to kill the head of a German arms manufacturer , a Western government official said.The plots have sometimes involved recruiting common criminals in foreign countries to conduct the attacks, said the official, who is familiar with the situation but not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.One major plot recently uncovered had targeted Armin Papperger, CEO of defense company Rheinmetall, the official said.The official declined to offer any details on other plots, which were first reported by CNN. The CNN report said the US informed Germany, whose security services were able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.Rheinmetall is a major supplier of military technology and artillery rounds for Ukraine as it fights off Russian forces. The company last month opened an armored vehicle maintenance and repair facility in western Ukraine and also aims to start production inside the country.White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson declined to comment on the alleged plot to kill Papperger but said, ""Russia's intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months.""""The United States has been discussing this issue with our Nato allies , and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,"" Watson added. ""We have also been clear that Russia's actions will not deter allies from continuing to support Ukraine.""Neither Rheinmetall nor the German government would comment Friday on the reported plot against Papperger. The Interior Ministry can't comment on ""individual threat situations,"" spokesperson Maximilian Kall said, but he added that more broadly, ""we take the significantly increased threat from Russian aggression very seriously.""""We know that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's regime wants above all to undermine our support for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression, but the German government won't be intimidated,"" Kall said.He noted that German security measures have increased significantly since 2022 and that ""the threats range from espionage and sabotage, through cyberattacks, to state terrorism.""European officials gathered for the Nato summit in Washington this week spoke of dealing with an escalation of ""hybrid"" attacks that they blame on Russia and its allies.That includes what authorities called suspicious recent fires at industrial and commercial sites in Lithuania, Poland, the United Kingdom, Germany and other nations, and charges that Russia-allied Belarus was sending large numbers of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa to the borders of Poland, Latvia and other countries belonging to Nato.When asked at a news conference at the Nato summit Thursday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he could not comment on the CNN report. He did note a widespread campaign by Russian security services to conduct ""hostile actions"" against Nato allies, including sabotage, cyberattacks and arson.""These are not standalone instances. These are part of a pattern, part of an ongoing Russian campaign. And the purpose of this campaign is, of course, to intimidate Nato allies from supporting Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said.In April, German investigators arrested two German-Russian men on suspicion of espionage, one of them accused of agreeing to carry out attacks on potential targets, including US military facilities, in hopes of sabotaging aid for Ukraine.Germany has become the second-biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine after the United States since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report of a plan to kill Papperger. ""All of this is again presented in the fake style, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,"" he told reporters Friday.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Russian counterpart, Andrei Belousov, on Friday, their second call in less than a month, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh announced at a briefing Friday. The call was initiated by the Russian defense minister, Singh said.She did not have further details to share, including whether the two leaders spoke about the accusations that Russia had attempted to assassinate top officials of Western defense firms producing weapons systems that are sent to Ukraine, but said ""maintaining lines of communication is incredibly important right now.""","Western intelligence agencies have uncovered Russian plots to carry out assassinations, arson and other sabotage in Europe.

Turkey introduces contentious bill targeting stray dogs; sparks outcry from rights groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/turkey-introduces-contentious-bill-targeting-stray-dogs-sparks-outcry-from-rights-groups/articleshow/111702653.cms,"(With agency inputs)

Turkey's ruling party , led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , introduced a contentious bill in parliament aimed at addressing the country's rising stray dog population. The proposed legislation states that stray dogs would be removed from the streets and placed in shelters where they would undergo neutering and spaying.The proposal, presented by senior legislator from the ruling party Abdullah Guler, also said that dogs at risk of rabies, exhibiting aggressive behavior, and having no possibility of rehabilitation would be euthanized.The proposal also requires municipalities to improve conditions in existing shelters and encourages people to adopt the dogs.The proposal has raised concerns among critics who fear it will lead to dogs being held in overcrowded shelters and potentially result in the killing of many animals. The bill has sparked a debate between animal rights activists and those who advocate for measures to ensure the safety of streets from feral dogs.According to Erdogan , an estimated four million stray dogs are currently roaming on the streets and countryside of Turkey. The initial proposal, which was not submitted to parliament, reportedly called for the strays to be collected, placed in shelters, and euthanized if not adopted within 30 days. This proposal had sparked a public outcry, with animal rights activists arguing that it would lead to the mass killing of unadopted dogs.The Safe Streets and Defense of the Right to Life Association, an organization advocating for the removal of all stray dogs from the streets, released a report noting that 65 people have died in street dog attacks since 2022. The government pledged to address the issue earlier this year after a child in Ankara was severely injured in a dog attack.Animal rights groups argue that the existing legislation, which requires stray dogs to be caught, neutered, spayed, and returned to their original location, has not been properly implemented over the years, leading to the explosion of the feral dog population. They believe that proper implementation of these regulations would be sufficient to control the population.Recently, Britain issued a warning to travelers to Turkey regarding stray dogs, which pointed out that they often form packs and can be aggressive. Visitors were advised to exercise caution and avoid approaching them.",Turkey's ruling party introduced a contentious bill in parliament aimed at addressing the country's rising stray dog population.

Quoting government sources, the MyRepublica news portal said this decision carries more operational than political significance and aligns with Nepal's participation in Chinese President Xi Jinping 's multi-billion-dollar pet infrastructure project.""The Cabinet meeting held on Thursday decided to approve the 'Strengthening the Development Cooperation in Building the Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network' agreement between Nepal and China,"" the report quoted Communication Minister and the government's spokesperson Rekha Sharma as saying.However, a minister downplayed its immediate impact, stating, ""This is an initial decision; details of project implementation and BRI modalities are yet to be finalised.""'Prachanda' lost the vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday after coalition partner Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) withdrew support for him, a development that will lead to the formation of a new government led by ex-prime minister K P Sharma Oli .Prachanda received only 63 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives (HoR) and there were 194 votes against the motion. At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust. A total of 258 HoR members participated in the voting while one member abstained.Prachanda's move, made just before he departed from office, is viewed not only as progress towards implementing BRI projects but also crucial for initiatives like the Kerung-Kathmandu railway and broader infrastructure development along the Nepal-China border, the report said.Earlier, ahead of signing a power-sharing agreement with UML, the Nepali Congress had resolved to ""only accept grants and not loans under the BRI project"". The government was also set to decide on implementing the 2017 BRI agreement with China, which has been pending at the cabinet.The BRI has raised global concerns over China's debt diplomacy of extending huge loans to smaller countries for unsustainable infrastructure projects.

US President Joe Biden hit the campaign trail on Friday with the aim to reassure voters and fellow Democrats about his ability to lead, following a major press conference that failed to quell calls for his withdrawal from the race. During a visit to a diner in Northville, Michigan, a crucial swing state he must secure in November to defeat Donald Trump , the 81-year-old said, ""We've got to finish the job.And I promise you I am OK.""Later in Detroit, Biden delivered a speech cautioning against the ""nightmare"" of a second Trump term, based on a far-right agenda that his campaign is attributing to the former president.""There's been a lot of speculation lately.

Slip-ups to addressing health concerns: Key takeaways from Biden's press conference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/slip-ups-to-addressing-health-concerns-key-takeaways-from-bidens-press-conference/articleshow/111674611.cms,"Here are the key takeaways from Biden's first solo news conference:

Slip-up came early

On Kamala Harris being a potential replacement

On Israel-Gaza war

Will Biden drop out of the race?

On health concerns

US President Joe Biden faced the much-anticipated challenge on Thursday - a solo press conference where he was questioned by the White House press corps.The purpose of this news conference was to reassure discouraged Democratic lawmakers, allies, and persuadable voters in the upcoming election that Biden still possesses the strength and stamina required to be president.Biden has blamed his dismal debate performance on ""feeling terrible"" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign.During the press conference, President Biden made a notable gaffe early on when he mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Vice President Trump."" The slip-up occurred while explaining his decision to choose her as his running mate, believing she could defeat Trump in an election.Prior to the news conference, Biden had already committed a significant blunder at the NATO summit, which instantly lowered expectations for his performance. While introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Biden accidentally said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin."" The mistake immediately elicited gasps from the audience. Realizing his error, Biden quickly corrected himself, turning to Zelenskyy and saying, ""President Putin? You're going to beat President Putin.""When a reporter brought up Biden's reference to ""Vice President Trump"" and pointed out that the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign was already capitalizing on the slip-up, the President remained defiant. ""Listen to him,"" he said before exiting the stage, refusing to engage further with the question or acknowledge the potential impact of his mistake.When asked about Harris' capability to take over his role, Biden affirmed his confidence in her qualifications, stating, ""I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,"" and highlighted her experience as a prosecutor and US Senator.However, when questioned further, Biden admitted that he had shifted away from his 2020 campaign promise to serve as a ""bridge"" to a new generation of Democrats.He attributed this change to ""the gravity of the situation I inherited,"" without mentioning his vice president. Biden emphasized his commitment to completing his current responsibilities, repeatedly asserting, ""I've got to finish this job.""Biden announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire framework, although some details still need to be finalized. He mentioned that he had dispatched his team to the region to work out the specifics of the agreement.""That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas. So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details,"" Biden said in a news conference.The President also stated that the conflict between Israel and Gaza must end immediately, and that Israel should not occupy the enclave once the war concludes. Additionally, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the outcome of some of his initiatives in Gaza, particularly the planned closure of the US military's humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza. ""I was hopeful that would be more successful,"" he said.President Biden dismissed concerns about his capability to serve another term, despite stumbling over a reference to Donald Trump early in the press conference.""I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job I started,"" Biden asserted, emphasizing that his support among voters remained strong and that he would continue his campaign and secure victory.Regardless of any missteps, the president countered all implications that he was slowing down, exhibiting significant signs of decline, or struggling to lead effectively. However, he faced increasing pressure from politicians, public figures, and prominent members of the Democratic Party to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race .""My schedule has been full bore,"" he affirmed. ""So if I slow down and I cant get the job done, that's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it. But there's no indication of that yet — none.""""I'm determined on running but I think it's important that I allay fears — let them see me out there,"" he concluded, expressing his commitment to the campaign while acknowledging the need to address any apprehensions about his candidacy.President Biden has affirmed that his health remains robust and that he is open to undergoing an additional neurological examination to assess his cognitive abilities if his medical team advises it.The President disclosed that he has already undergone three rigorous neurological evaluations, with the most recent one taking place in February. He stated, ""I am in good shape,"" based on the feedback from his physicians. Currently, there are no recommendations from his doctors for him to undergo another such examination.(With agency inputs)","US President Joe Biden held his first solo press conference on Thursday.

‘I love Joe Biden. But we need a new nominee’: George Clooney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-love-joe-biden-but-we-need-a-new-nominee-george-clooney/articleshow/111703296.cms,"I’m a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I’m proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party’s history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016.Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden’s re-election.I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced. But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe “big F-ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, whom we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor who I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.We love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he’s been convicted of 34 felonies. That’s new and upsetting information as well. Top Democrats — Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi — and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.All of the scary stories that we’re being told about what would happen next are simply not true. In all likelihood, the money in the Biden-Harris coffers could go to help elect the presidential ticket and other Democrats. The new nominee wouldn’t be left off ballots in Ohio. We Democrats have a very exciting bench. We don’t anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality; we vote for a president. We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they’re best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we’re seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.Let’s hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let’s agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would. The short ramp to Election Day would be a benefit for us, not a danger. It would give us the chance to showcase the future without so much opposition research and negative campaigning that comes with these ridiculously long and expensive election seasons. This can be an exciting time for democracy, as we’ve just seen with the 200 or so French candidates who stepped aside and put their personal ambitions on hold to save their democracy from the far right.Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.",Sally Kohn: I’m a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. She says the one battle Biden cannot win is the fight against time.

The interruption occurred when President Joe Biden 's news conference started late and overran its scheduled time slot by 30 minutes, causing delays in the three-hour show.The ABC telecast returned from a commercial break in the final minutes but began repeating earlier award presentations.This mishap led to the cutting off of Venus Williams ' farewell and the final credits. ABC has not yet explained the technical issues that caused this.Prince Harry received the Pat Tillman Award for Service, mentioning the criticism ESPN faced from the late Army Ranger’s mother for honoring him.Last week, Mary Tillman, the mother of war hero Pat Tillman, voiced her astonishment upon learning that Prince Harry had been chosen to receive an award named after her son. ""I am shocked as to why they would select such a controversial and divisive individual to receive the award,"" she stated, expressing her disbelief at the decision.In her critique of the network's selection, Mary Tillman proposed that there were numerous other individuals within the veteran community who would have been more suitable recipients of the honor.

'I'm not going anywhere': Biden stands ground in Michigan amid calls to drop out of the race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-not-going-anywhere-biden-stands-ground-in-michigan-amid-calls-to-drop-out-of-the-race/articleshow/111702631.cms,"US President Joe Biden held a rally in Detroit on Friday, seeking to revive his struggling reelection campaign. He told the cheering crowd that he wasn't going to leave the race and warned that Donald Trump poses a serious threat.Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd in Detroit, Biden pivoted to warnings about the potential consequences of a second Donald Trump term and declared, ""You made me the nominee, no one else — not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors.You, the voters. You decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere.""As the Detroit crowd chanted ""don't you quit!"" and ""we got your back!"" Biden reaffirmed his commitment to running for reelection and vowed to ""shine a spotlight on Donald Trump"" and what the Republican would do if he returned to the White House. He criticized a far-right policy agenda crafted by conservative think tanks, which Trump has tried to distance himself from, while listing several items on his own wish list for the first 100 days of his second term.At the same school where, four years ago, then-candidate Biden positioned himself as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leaders, the president made it clear he was not going anywhere.""You made me the nominee, no one else — not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors,"" Biden said, to cheers. ""You, the voters. You decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere.""Despite Biden's efforts to convince lawmakers, donors, and the electorate of his capability to be president at the age of 81, concerns within the party about his candidacy and prospects against Trump in November persist. So far, one Democratic senator and roughly 20 House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside.During the rally, Biden criticized Trump's business failures and singled out Project 2025, a proposed overhaul of the federal government drafted by Trump's allies and former officials, which Trump has tried to distance himself from.Biden's campaign has acknowledged that his route to the White House is narrowing, focusing on the ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as the clearest pathway to victory. This strategy is reflected in Biden's efforts to rally enthusiasm in Detroit and among its sizable Black population, which could prove decisive for his chances of winning Michigan.","US President Joe Biden held a rally in Detroit on Friday, seeking to revive his struggling reelection campaign.

Representative James Clyburn and California Governor Gavin Newsom both voiced their support. United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain praised Biden for standing ""with the working class,"" although he did not name him directly.However, Biden's backing appears to be weakening in some quarters. Two more lawmakers have recently called for him to exit the race. Representative Mike Levin of California issued a statement saying, ""It is time to move forward. With a new leader."" Levin, who faces his own competitive reelection, joins at least 19 lawmakers in asking Biden to withdraw.Despite these defections, Biden retains substantial support from key figures in the Democratic Party and has vowed to contest the Nov. 5 election.""I'm riding with Biden no matter which direction he goes,"" Clyburn announced on NBC's ""Today"" program.

She concluded that this conduct was highly prejudicial to Baldwin, who immediately burst into tears upon hearing the decision. If found guilty, the Hollywood star could have faced up to 18 months in prison.The dismissal of the case centered around live bullets potentially linked to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins , which were handed to police by a ""Good Samaritan"" earlier this year. The former police officer and family friend of the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, claimed the bullets matched the rounds that killed Hutchins. However, the defense argued that police had ""buried"" this evidence by not filing it under the ""Rust"" case, depriving them of the opportunity to examine it.Despite the prosecution's attempts to salvage the case, Judge Marlowe Sommer remained unconvinced and dismissed the charges with prejudice. Legal experts believe that Baldwin is unlikely to face criminal proceedings again over the shooting due to double jeopardy protections. However, he may still be subject to civil suits. The withheld evidence could also benefit Gutierrez, who is currently serving an 18-month sentence for involuntary manslaughter and has launched an appeal, as well as David Halls, the film's first assistant director who took a plea deal and admitted negligence.","The involuntary manslaughter trial of Alec Baldwin came to an abrupt end on Friday in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

A defiant US President Joe Biden on Friday tried to reassure voters he was in good shape Friday as he returned to the campaign trail amid mounting pressure from Democrats to step aside.""We've got to finish the job. And I promise you I am OK,"" the 81-year-old told supporters at a diner in Northville in the battleground state of Michigan, which he must win in November to beat Donald Trump.Even as President Joe Biden tried to put up a brave fight in the high-stakes White House 'big boy' press conference, donors and a few members of his own party don't seem convinced that the 81-year-old has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump in the elections four months from now, let alone lead the country for the next four years.Though the president was able to present a detailed picture of his policies and was more adept at capturing the moment to take down his rival Trump on key issues, the continued verbal flubs referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as Vice President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as President Putin, seems to have given democratic donors, fellow colleagues, and more importantly skeptics, the incentive to pressure Biden into dropping out of the race.As a first response after the conference, several major donors on Friday informed the Biden campaign that they will be withholding around $90 million of promised funds due to reservations about President Biden running again, the New York Times reported. According to two individuals quoted, the frozen amounts include “multiple eight-figure commitments.” The report mentioned that Future Forward declined to comment beyond stating their belief that the contributions would be released once the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic ticket was resolved.While a few Democrats have refrained from publicly calling for Biden to end his campaign, they have expressed discontent privately. More than a dozen Democratic House members and at least one Democratic senator have openly called for Biden to withdraw from his reelection bid. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who remains in Congress and is one of the party's most influential figures, has privately voiced her concerns.However, over 70 members of the House and Senate have also publicly reaffirmed their support for Biden as the party’s presidential nominee following his poor debate performance late last month.Meanwhile, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, met with President Joe Biden on Thursday night to discuss various perspectives on Biden's candidacy.

President Joe Biden will probably continue to make gaffes, a Biden campaign official said Friday after his two big slips at the Nato event, a day earlier.

The official said Biden has been making gaffes for the last 40 years, Reuters reported.81-year-old Biden makes international headlines from Nato summit not for his speech but for his gaffes as his ability to run for another presidency is being questioned.Democrats, Hollywood sponsors are withdrawing support from Biden with George Clooney, Ashley Judd writing opinion pieces on Biden's slim chances to win against Donald Trump this year.But it is true that Biden's gaffes are not new. In 2020, Biden made a quote from the Declaration of Independence and said: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women were created by the go-, uh, you know the, you know the thing!""In 2015, when he was vice president, Biden made a joke which was seen as awkward and probably a mix-up when then-Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny visited his house on St Patrick's Day. ""Anyone wearing orange, you're not welcome in... only joking,"" he said, wearing a green tie as they smiled for a picture. Orange is the colour associated with the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland, while green is used as a symbol by mostly Catholic Irish nationalists.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) revealed in a “Dear Colleague” letter Friday morning that he “was graciously granted a private meeting” with the 81-year-old president the previous day.“In my conversation with President Biden, I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the Caucus has shared in our recent time together,” the Brooklyn Democrat wrote.Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama reportedly discussed the concerns over Biden in private but they decided to wait and watch as they don't know what to do with the situation.","81-year-old Biden makes international headlines from Nato summit not for his speech but for his gaffes.

A new documentary makes the case that America's 'greatest president' Abraham Lincoln was gay . Titled “Lover of Men: The untold history of Abraham Lincoln,” the film claims to reveal Lincoln’s romantic relationships with men, using insights from leading Lincoln scholars and previously unseen photographs and letters, according to promotional video material obtained by several media outlets.“Lincoln probably slept in the same bed with more men than he did with women,” the New York Post quoted one one expert in the film as saying.The documentary features interviews with historians from prestigious institutions, including Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Wellesley, and Rutgers. Directed by Shaun Peterson, the film explores Lincoln’s deep connections with men, delving into the history of human sexual fluidity and highlighting the stark differences between 19th-century sexual norms and those of today.Peterson, who described the film as a ""passion project"" on Instagram, has been working on it for years. The documentary aims to fill a significant gap in American history and challenge the audience to reconsider their views on human sexuality, he said.While this is not the first exploration of Lincoln’s sexuality—previous articles and books have discussed his close relationships with men, including a male ""roommate"" with whom he shared a bed—the film reportedly presents new insights and evidence.The trailer however shows Lincoln’s legacy of equality, suggesting that accepting a queer Lincoln can lead to greater acceptance of queer people and inspire the pursuit of true democracy for everyone.“Lincoln’s legacy is the insistence on equality”, the trailer adds. “If you can accept a queer Lincoln, you can accept queer people overall, he should inspire us to achieve a true democracy for everyone.”Lincoln, a moderate Republican renowned for his leadership during the Civil War and the Gettysburg Address, was assassinated in April 1865.","A new documentary makes the case that America's 'greatest president' Abraham Lincoln was gay.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for. Khan’s party strength stood at 84 in the National Assembly before the decision and is expected to rise to over 100.Under Pakistan’s election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats – 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims – in proportion to the number of seats they win.

"Imran Khan's party eligible for reserved seats in Pakistan's Parliament, SC verdicts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-eligible-for-reserved-seats-in-pakistans-parliament-sc-verdicts/articleshow/111684301.cms,"Pakistan's Supreme Court on Friday said that former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) is eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities , a major blow to PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government.A bench of 13 members announced the verdict and puts increased pressure on the country's fragile coalition government, according to the Reuters.Despite being barred from the polls, PTI candidates ran as independents in the February 8th election and secured the most seats. However, the election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats , which were intended solely for political parties.The SC placed the present petitions before the three-judge committee that determines the constitution of the bench for the reconstitution of a larger bench when attorney general Mansoor Usman Awan highlighted that under Section 4 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, the present case should be heard by a larger bench since the issue concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions, Dawn reported.A day ago, the court had reserved its decision on the matter after closing the hearing on a set of appe­als moved by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).The SIC had filed a petition demanding that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to PM Shehbaz’s ruling coalition after the February 8 general elections, be reallocated to the alliance. However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters. They have been claiming that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that supervised the polls engaged in electoral fraud to prevent them from winning. Both the commission and the military refute these allegations, but concerns have been raised in the West regarding the transparency of the elections.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Friday said that former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) is eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities.
