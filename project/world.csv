With the help of two accomplices, he then buried her body in a pit, four feet deep, in Madina village in Rohtak , Haryana, and returned to Delhi to resume his normal life.Probing the disappearance of the girl following a complaint by her family on Oct 23, cops have apprehended the prime suspect, Saleem , who masqueraded as Sanju. The body was exhumed from the fields in the village on Wednesday. The victim, Sonia, was pregnant, her family has claimed.During interrogation, Saleem is claimed to have said that Sonia had recently started talking to another boy. He is also said to have told the cops that Sonia wanted to keep the child and get married, but he was unwilling. That seems to have become the prime motive behind the killing.Acting on the details given by Saleem about the place where the body had been buried, Nangloi police have recovered it. There are numerous injury marks on the body, including some on the face, apparently made by sharp weapons, suggesting that she was subjected to physical violence before being killed.Sonia's brother had filed a complaint at Nangloi police station about his sister having been kidnapped. He had stated that Sonia had been in a relationship with Saleem for about a year. A day after Karva Chauth (Oct 21), Saleem allegedly took Sonia along with him in a car.""Saleem roped in two of his friends, Pankaj and Sohit, in the plan.

The spot was a kilometre away from the main road.Meanwhile, Sonia's family had tried to contact her but her phone was switched off. The family then called up Saleem. He refused to give her the phone, saying she didn't wish to speak to them.However, during the call, Sonia's brother-in-law, Manish, heard a voice in the background saying, ""Dig the pit deeper.""Frightened by this, the family approached police. They were told that the two were adults and if they wished to be with each other, the parents shouldn't interfere, the family claimed. When the family told them about overhearing a conversation about a pit being dug, the cops started an investigation, said the family. Using surveillance and a tip-off, the cops located Saleem at Paschim Vihar.They then apprehended Saleem and another man and recovered several documents belonging to Sonia.

""As I was trying to dig (my mother) out I looked at this wall and saw a tank aiming at me. I was thinking 'shall I dig or shall I watch the tank,' what shall I do? I dug her out full of fear. Everyone was doing the same, digging in fear,"" he said. At the nearby Nasser Hospital , medics prepared the dead, among them three children wrapped in the same white shroud.",Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 72 people since Thursday night.

America the Beautiful has become a 'garbage can' for the world: Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-america-the-beautiful-has-become-a-garbage-can-for-the-world-says-trump/articleshow/114587869.cms,"Image credit: Reuters

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Next only to the America's national anthem Star Spangled Banner, the songs American the Beautiful and God Bless the USA, often played at Trump rallies, are widely regarded as the country's top patriotic national songs. But according to the MAGA supremo, America has now become “a garbage can for the world” because of illegal border crossings.In campaign speeches on Thursday, the former President took his dark dystopian view of what America has become and carried his screed against illegal immigrants to a new low, while blaming the Biden-Harris administration border policies for turning the US into a ""garbage can.""“We’re like a garbage can, you know, it’s the first time I’ve ever said that. And every time I come up and talk about what they’ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I’ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it’s a very accurate description,” Trump raged at a rally in Tempe, Arizona, a battleground state on the border with Texas, in a clear effort to whip up his supporters.In other rallies through the day, Trump ramped up his tirade against illegal immigrants, who he has previously said are ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" calling them animals, who needed to be evicted from the country quickly.He also used new epithets for his political rivals, calling President Biden a ""stupid fool"" and saying former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is ""crazy as a bedbug,"" while continuing to disparage his opponent Kamala Harris.The MAGA supremo also ratcheted up his threats of retribution against journalists, whom he characterized as “the enemy of the people,” with a caveat that ""some reporters are good"" and ""we have to free them from the left.""Trump's dark vision of an America overrun by illegal immigrants, first expressed during his 2016 presidential campaign when he spoke of Mexico sending rapists to the US, has now taken a ominous tone. His speeches are laced with graphic description of immigrant crimes, despite studies showing immigrants -- legal or illegal -- are more law-abiding than people born in the US.Crimes, including homicides and assaults, is also falling nationwide, but the former President also cherrypicks data to argue that the US is going to the dogs, with violent illegal immigrant gangs overrunning American cities. He has dialed down on the hoax about Haitian immigrants eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, but has now picked up more authentic, established stories of murders and rapes by illegal immigrants, which are fewer than what happens in everyday America.Trump's dark rhetoric and his advocacy of strong-arm methods against not just illegal immigrants, whom he wants deported en masse, but also against political rivals, is triggering alarms about an imminent civil war in the US, graphically portrayed in a recent movie titled ""Civil War.""Stephen Marche, a Canadian writer whose book the movie is based on, has said in recent interviews that he thought the next civil war would take place in 2040, but he now feels he is wrong and it feels closer than that.In the book, Marche quotes a retired army colonel saying a new American civil war would not be like the first one, with armies maneuvring on the battlefield. “I think it would very much be a free-for-all... neighbor on neighbor, based on beliefs and skin colours and religion. And it would be horrific,"" he says.So far there have been no reported attacks on immigrants or neighbor-on-neighbor clashes due to political differences. If anything, battleground states have political mixed neighborhoods with Trump and Harris supporters living side by side quite amicably.But there are growing apprehensions that passions could explode in the hours and days after November 5 when Trump is expected to claim victory regardless of whether he wins or loses. The MAGA supremo has said he will only accept a result that shows him as the winner and it would not have been an honest election if the result is adverse.","In campaign speeches on Thursday, the former President took his dark dystopian view of what America has become.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Microsoft has terminated the employment of two individuals who organised an unauthorised vigil at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, to honour Palestinians killed in Gaza during the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas .The employees, Abdelrahman Mohamed and Hossam Nasr, were part of a group called ""No Azure for Apartheid"" that opposed Microsoft's sale of cloud-computing technology to the Israeli government.The employees argued that the event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee gift campaigns for people in need.Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist from Egypt, expressed disappointment in Microsoft's failure to provide a space for employees to come together and grieve for those who lost their lives. He now faces the challenge of finding a new job within two months to avoid deportation due to his work visa status.Nasr, an Egyptian-raised 2021 graduate of Harvard University and co-organiser of Harvard Alumni for Palestine, said that the vigil's purpose was twofold: to honour the victims of what he called the ""Palestinian genocide in Gaza"" and to draw attention to Microsoft's alleged complicity in the conflict through the use of its technology by the Israeli military.Nasr's firing was made public on social media by the watchdog groupStop Antisemitism before he received the official call from Microsoft.This incident follows a similar situation at Google, where more than 50 workers were fired in the aftermath of protests over the company's involvement in ""Project Nimbus,"" a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide cloud computing and artificial intelligence services to the Israeli government.Microsoft has declined to provide specific details about the firings, citing privacy and confidentiality considerations, but maintains its commitment to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment.",Two Microsoft employees were fired for holding an unauthorised vigil.

The Washington Post ’s decision not to endorse any candidate in the 2024 presidential election has sparked criticism and resignations, even as The Post’s leadership attempts to justify it.The Post’s 36-year tradition of endorsing presidential candidates was reportedly called off by the billionaire owner Jeff Bezos , according to The New York Post.The editorial page staffers had reportedly drafted an endorsement for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump The decision seems to have caused divisions within The Post. Veteran editorial board member Robert Kagan , a vocal Trump critic, resigned in protest. Former editor Marty Baron condemned the move as “cowardice, with democracy as its casualty,” arguing it undermines The Post's role in holding political leaders accountable.Critics, including some staff, have questioned Bezos’s motives, noting his vast business interests. They speculate his decision may stem from Trump’s past criticisms of Bezos and Amazon, given the company’s reliance on government contracts.Publisher Will Lewis announced that The Washington Post would be “returning to its roots” by refraining from endorsements in this and future elections. In a note to readers, Lewis acknowledged that some might see this as “a tacit endorsement or condemnation” of one candidate over another. However, he argued that the decision reflects commitment to “integrity and courage in public service.”Bezos, worth an estimated $209 billion, hasn’t commented publicly, fueling further speculation. Former Washington Post editor Karen Attiah voiced frustration, calling the decision “a stab in the back to all of us who value democracy.”Numerous subscribers took to social media, with some cancelling subscriptions and accusing Bezos of prioritizing his business agenda over public service. Many commenters saw it as a betrayal of The Post’s readers, who’ve long relied on the paper for guidance on political endorsements.This trend isn’t unique to The Post, as The Los Angeles Times also recently announced a similar policy, reportedly directed by owner Patrick Soon-Shiong.The policy has led to resignations and raised concerns over the growing influence of wealthy media owners on editorial decisions. Critics argue these choices mark a troubling shift in how news organizations engage with democratic processes, especially during divisive times.","The Washington Post will not endorse any candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

The names of both individuals are redacted, and the cemetery worker's sworn statement to the police is entirely blacked out. Officials had previously stated that the former president's staffer pushed the cemetery worker when she was trying to prevent two people from filming and photographing Trump's visit to gravesites in Section 60, a sacred area where US forces killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried.The report indicates that the cemetery worker declined medical treatment and did not wish to press charges. American Oversight , a Washington-based government transparency group, filed a lawsuit demanding the release of the police report, and a federal judge ordered it to be made public by Friday. The group has posted the report on its website.Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is in a close race against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, and the altercation raised concerns about his campaign's politicization of the military. Trump was at the cemetery at the invitation of service members' families and brought staff to document the visit. He later shared a video from the visit on TikTok, which included scenes of him at the cemetery and a voiceover blaming theBiden administration for the ""disaster"" of the Afghanistan withdrawal in August 2021.Chioma Chukwu, interim executive director of American Oversight, expressed satisfaction that the report was released, allowing the public to see ""that there is still an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation into the August incident at Arlington National Cemetery."" Chukwu emphasized that Trump and his staff's conduct ""aligns with his history of politicizing the military and violating clear ethical boundaries, and it's time for the public to have all the facts.""In a letter accompanying the report, Army senior counsel Paul DeAgostino explained that the redactions were made to protect personal privacy and information compiled for law enforcement purposes.He said that the records are part of an ongoing investigation and their release ""could reasonably be expected to interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings.""The Army reiterated DeAgostino's comment, stating that it released the report to comply with the court order and that the police investigation ""remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time.""It is unclear what law enforcement proceedings are ongoing, as the employee declined to press charges. Families of three service members killed in a suicide bombing during the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal had invited Trump to a ceremony marking the third anniversary of the attack. They said the former president knew their children's stories and have blamed the Biden administration for their deaths.A defense official had previously stated that the Trump campaign was warned about not taking photographs in Section 60 before their arrival and the altercation. During a campaign event in Michigan several days after the incident, Trump complained that family members had asked to take a photo with him at the cemetery, saying, ""They ask me to have a picture, and they say I was campaigning,"" without addressing the TikTok video.",The US Army on Friday disclosed a almost entirely redacted police report detailing an incident in which a member of Donald Trump's campaign staff allegedly pushed an Arlington National Cemetery employee.

It demonizes half of the country,” Dorr wrote on X.“And it belittles the pain of actual holocaust survivors,” he added. “Kamala will lose.

Chinese hackers targeted data from the phones used by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a New York Times report said citing people familiar with the matter. Investigators are yet to determine what communication data was taken or observed by the hackers.""The type of information on phones used by a presidential candidate and his running mate could be a gold mine for an intelligence agency: Who they called and texted, how often they communicated with certain people, and how long they talked to those people could be highly valuable to an adversary like China. That sort of communications data could be even more useful if hackers could observe it in real time,"" the NYT report said.The Donald Trump campaign was informed that Trump and Vance's phones were among a number of people inside and outside of the government whose phone numbers had been targeted through the infiltration of Verizon phone systems .Data about the communications of a presidential and vice-presidential candidate — even absent the content of the calls and messages — could also help an adversary like China better identify and target people in Trump’s inner circle for influence operations, the report said.A Trump campaign spokesman did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance had been targeted. But in a statement, the spokesman, Steven Cheung, criticized the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris and sought to blame them for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign.Earlier this year, security officials discovered the presence in American telecommunications systems of a China-affiliated hacking group called Salt Typhoon by Western cybersecurity experts. But investigators determined only recently that the hackers were targeting specific phone numbers, the officials said.The investigation into the extent of the hacking and any national security damage is in its early stages. Whether such an attack could monitor or record phone conversations is difficult to know, and whether the hackers could read or intercept texts, for example, would depend in no small part on which messaging apps the targets used and how that data moved over the phone company’s systems.","Chinese hackers targeted data from the phones used by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a New York Times report said.

Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi released after Islamabad HC grants bail in graft case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imrans-wife-bushra-bibi-released-after-islamabad-hc-grants-bail-in-graft-case/articleshow/114558908.cms,"Photo/Agencies

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

Fake news of rape sparks real protest in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fake-news-of-rape-sparks-real-protest-in-pakistan/articleshow/114538687.cms,"The recent reports of a college campus rape that went viral on social media have sparked a heated debate in Pakistan . While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.
