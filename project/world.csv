"'You are tubelights': Owaisi’s swipe at BJP after Nishikant Dubey's remark on SC, CJI Khanna",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-are-tubelights-owaisis-swipe-at-bjp-after-nishikant-dubeys-remark-on-sc-cji-khanna/articleshow/120447169.cms,"NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi mocked BJP leaders as ""tubelights"" on Sunday, following controversial remarks by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India.Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.""You people (BJP) are tubelights... Do you even know what Article 142 is? It was framed by Dr. BR Ambedkar,"" Owaisi said, accusing the BJP of threatening the judiciary with religious warfare.You people are in power and have become so radicalised that you're now threatening the court with a religious war. Modi ji, if you don't stop these people, the country will become weak. The country won’t forgive you, and tomorrow, you won’t be in power,” he added.This comes in response to Nishikant Dubey’s comments suggesting that Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like a law-making body.Taking aim at the Supreme Court, Dubey said, “Kanoon yadi Supreme Court hi banayega to Sansad Bhavan band kar dena chahiye” (If the Supreme Court is going to make the laws, then the Parliament should be shut down).Targeting the Chief Justice of India, he added, “Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.”Echoing similar sentiments, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma said, “There is an apprehension among the public that when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote the Constitution, the roles of the Legislature and the Judiciary were clearly defined. According to the Constitution, no one can direct the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and the President has already given her assent to the law. No one can challenge the President, as the President is supreme…”These remarks come at a sensitive time, as the Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which was passed by Parliament in early April.In response to the court’s concerns, the Centre has agreed to temporarily hold off on implementing certain controversial provisions of the law until the next hearing.Meanwhile, the BJP has “outrightly rejected” and distanced itself from the remarks made by its MPs, and members have been cautioned against making such statements in the future.“The statements made by BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Dinesh Sharma regarding the judiciary and the Chief Justice have no connection whatsoever with the Bharatiya Janata Party . These are their personal views. The BJP neither agrees with nor endorses such statements. The BJP outrightly rejects them,” BJP national president J.P. Nadda said in a post on X.“The Bharatiya Janata Party has always respected the judiciary and has wholeheartedly accepted its orders and suggestions. As a party, we believe that the Supreme Court, along with all other courts in the country, is an integral part of our democracy and a strong pillar in safeguarding the Constitution. I have directed both of them—and everyone else—to refrain from making such statements,” he added.","Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.

Opposition slams Dubey's statement

'His attack on the Supreme Court is not acceptable'

BJP defends Nishikant's remark

NEW DELHI: After Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar questioned Supreme Court , a BJP leader has added fuel to the fire, saying Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like it. Targeting Chief Justice of India, he said, ""Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.""Taking aim at Supreme Court on Friday, seasoned BJP parliamentarian Nishikant Dubey in a cryptic post on X wrote, ""(Parliament should be closed down if the Supreme Court has to make the laws).""Later today, Dubey said that the Supreme Court is responsible for inciting religious wars in the country. ""The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and State Assembly should be shut,"" he added.""How can you give direction to the appointing authority? The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The Parliament makes the law of this country. You will dictate that Parliament? How did you make a new law? In which law is it written that the President has to take a decision within three months? This means that you want to take this country towards anarchy. When the Parliament sits, there will be a detailed discussion on this,"" he further said.The BJP leader also criticised the apex court over Article 377, saying, ""there was an Article 377 in which homosexuality is a big crime. The Trump administration has said that there are only two sexes in this world, either male or female. Whether it is Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, all believe that homosexuality is a crime. One fine morning, the Supreme Court said that we abolish this case.""""Article 141 says that the laws we make, the judgments we give, are applicable from the lower court to the Supreme Court. Article 368 says that Parliament has the right to make all laws and the Supreme Court has the right to interpret the law,"" he added.Congress MP slammed Dubey's remark saying that ""BJP is trying to weaken the Supreme Court."" ""Constitutional functionaries, ministers, BJP MPs are speaking against the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court is saying one thing that when a law is made, you should not go against the basic structure of the constitution and if the law is against the constitution, we will not accept it. Deliberately, the Supreme Court is being targeted as in many issues like electoral bonds, the Supreme Court has said that what has been done by the government is unconstitutional,"" he added.""This is a defamatory statement against the Supreme Court. Nishikant Dubey is a person who continuously demolishes all other institutions. Now, he has attacked the Supreme Court. I hope that the Supreme Court judges will take this into notice as he is not speaking in Parliament but outside it. His attack on the Supreme Court is not acceptable,"" Congress leader Manickam Tagore told ANI.Congress MP Imran Masood also criticised BJP leader's statement and said it was ""unfortunate.""""The kind of statements that are coming against the Supreme Court are very unfortunate...This is not the first time that the Supreme Court has given a decision against the full majority government...This frustration is incomprehensible,"" Masood said.Advocate and Congress leader Salman Khurshid said, ""It is a matter of great sadness if an MP questions the Supreme Court or any court. In our legal system, the final word is not of the government, it is of the Supreme Court. If someone does not understand this, then it is a matter of great sadness.""AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""He has made a very shoddy statement. I hope that tomorrow only, the Supreme Court will initiate suo-moto contempt proceedings against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and send him to jail. Whenever any judge gives a judgment in favour of the BJP, they are sent to the Rajya Sabha , and now, when a judge gave an instruction that the law should be followed and governors should not sit indefinitely on bills, the BJP has used all its resources to defame the judges and attack the Supreme Court.""BJP's Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra said, ""On the Manipur issue, the Supreme Court took a suo motu cognisance, but we are seeing that several parts of West Bengal are burning, but the eyes of the Supreme Court are closed. The entire country is looking at the Supreme Court that the SC would give direction to the Govt to impose President's rule in West Bengal, but the Supreme Court is silent.""Dubey's remarks came amid hearings on several pleas ongoing in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act. Parliament passed the Bill in the first week of April.Meanwhile, Centre has decided not to implement some of its contentious provisions till the next date of hearing after court raised several concerns over them.The timing of Dubey's remark is also noteworthy as Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar recently voiced strong disapproval of Supreme Court's judgement after it set a timeline for the President to take decision on the bills sent to her.“We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?” Dhankhar questioned SC while speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave on Thursday.""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further said.However, opposition parties lauded court's observation over the Waqf Act and direction to President.",BJP MP Nishikant Dubey says Parliament should stop functioning if Supreme Court acts like it.

Indi-Chini boys in US mount legal challenge against MAGA strike on foreign students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indi-chini-boys-in-us-mount-legal-challenge-against-maga-strike-on-foreign-students-f1-visa-termination-us-trump/articleshow/120437509.cms,"Image credit: AP

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

A group of three Indian and two Chinese students on Friday mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration for disrupting the academic pursuit of hundreds of foreign students and academics in the US, often on minor grounds such as traffic and parking violations.In a class action lawsuit filed before the US District Court in New Hampshire, the five students, through their attorneys, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security has unilaterally terminated F-1 student status of ""hundreds, if not thousands,"" of foreign students and Optional Practical Training (“OPT”) participants throughout the US. They sought reinstatement of student visas that have been terminated, including theirs, and a halt to detentions and deportations.The three Indian plaintiffs Manikanta Pasula, Likhith Babu Gorrela, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli, are students at Rivier University in New Hampshire, and the two Chinese plaintiffs Hangrui Zhang and Haoyang An, are graduate students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Indians and Chinese the two largest foreign groups in the US academia, with more than half million students between them.In the lawsuit, Pasula, now in the third semester of a computer engineering master's program, described being arrested and charged with driving without a valid US license while he had his Indian driver’s license. New Hampshire permits the use of an International Driving Permit for up to 60 days after foreign student’s arrival in the United States, and while Pasula was driving within that 60-day window, he pled guilty, paid a $248 fine, and immediately obtained a valid U.S. driver’s license.Earlier this month, Pasula received an email from Rivier University that the State Department revoked his visa. He separately received an email from the U.S. Consulate General, Mumbai, that confirmed that his visa was revoked and that “remaining in the United States without a lawful immigration status can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation.”The two other cases involving Indian students are similar. Thanuj was charged with speeding and a traffic misdemeanor for failing to carry a valid US driver’s license. Although he had a valid international driving permit at the time, he was outside the 60-day window in which the international driving permit is allowed in New Hampshire. Gorrela too had an international driving permit but was using it beyond the 60-day window. Although both paid fines and subsequently got their US licenses, the DHS nixed their student status, putting them on track for visa revocation and deportation.Of the two Chinese students, the lawsuit says Haoyang was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without an active insurance policy in Massachusetts, and Hangrui was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor in an episode stemming from a misunderstanding. Although both cases were subsequently dismissed in court, their student status was also revoked in the DHS crackdown that now extends to infractions that go far beyond political activism.Attorneys for the students said the Trump administration's ""unilateral and unlawful terminations"" have severely disrupted the educational opportunities of students who are in the middle of their studies (and in the middle of a semester) and who are simply trying to obtain, often at considerable expense, an education in the US while following all the rules required of them.""These injuries are real.... Their graduation is unpredictable and unlikely unless this Court intervenes,"" the lawsuit said, describing the students' situation. Linkhith Babu Gorrela’s graduation date for his Master’s program is May 20, 2025, and without a valid F-1 student status, he may not obtain his Master’s degree. Nor can he participate in the OPT program after graduation.Similarly, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli and Manikanta Pasula have only one semester left before they can complete their Master’s degrees and participate in the OPT program. Hangrui Zhang’s only source of income, the lawsuit said, is his research assistantship which has been cut off in light of the termination of his F-1 student status. Haoyang An will have to abandon his Master’s program despite having already invested $329,196 in his education in the US.","Group of three Indian and two Chinese students mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration.

NEW DELHI: India has strongly condemned the brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy , a prominent Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh, calling it part of a “pattern of systematic persecution” of Hindus under Muhammad Yunus-led interim government.Ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal posted on X (formerly Twitter), “We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh. This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity. We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.”Roy, 58, served as the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad and was a well-known figure in the Hindu community of Dinajpur’s Biral upazila.According to his wife, Shantana Roy, Bhabesh was at home when he received a phone call around 4:30 pm on Thursday. She said the call was made by the perpetrators to confirm his presence at home. About 30 minutes later, four men reportedly arrived on two motorcycles and abducted him.Quoting eyewitnesses, The Daily Star reported that Bhabesh was taken to Narabari village, where he was brutally assaulted. Later that evening, the attackers allegedly brought his unconscious body back to his home on a van. Family members, aided by locals, rushed him to the Biral Upazila Health Complex. He was later transferred to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.His body has been sent for autopsy.Quoting Abdus Sabur, officer-in-charge of Biral police station, The Daily Star reported that preparations are underway to file a case. Police are currently working to identify and apprehend the suspects.The killing has sparked fresh outrage among human rights groups and diaspora communities, who have repeatedly raised concerns over the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh.","India has strongly condemned the brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh.

'horrific and unacceptable': NCW

VHP holds country-wide protests

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Amit Malviya on Saturday claimed that Hindu families in West Bengal's Murshidabad district were systematically targeted during recent violence linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.In a post on X, Malviya said that homes belonging to Hindu residents were marked with ink and kept under watch before being torched. He further alleged that two local Muslim residents helped attackers identify Hindu-owned houses and shops.""Shocking details emerging from Murshidabad! Before the arson attacks began, homes belonging to Hindu families were marked with ink and kept under close watch. After days of surveillance, these properties were systematically torched,"" Malviya wrote, adding that such targeted violence is reported to occur frequently, especially on Fridays.""Reports suggest that two local Muslim residents supplied key information to the attackers, helping them pinpoint Hindu-owned houses and shops. Disturbingly, similar targeted violence is said to occur regularly—particularly on Fridays,"" he added.The BJP IT cell head also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of ""encouraging demographic change in border districts just to remain in power.""The incident that triggered these allegations occurred on April 11 during protests over the Waqf Act in Murshidabad, where a father-son duo — Harogobindo Das and Chandan Das — were found murdered with multiple stab wounds at their residence in the Jafrabad locality of Shamsherganj.Earlier today, West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose met the grieving family, assuring them of justice and support. ""I will look into your requests, There are three to four suggestions. They have asked for BSF postings in the locality. I will take up the matter with the appropriate authorities. Some proactive action will definitely be taken,"" he said, adding that the family has been provided the ‘Peace Room’ helpline number to reach out directly to Raj Bhavan.Many visuals showed the victims' family members breaking down in front of the governor, falling at his feet and pleading for justice. Later, after speaking with locals in Dhulian Bazar, Bose said, ""I have asked them (the victims) to feel free to talk to me. They want justice, and they will get justice.""The incident has also drawn strong condemnation from the National Commission for Women . Commission member Archana Majumdar, who visited the affected area, described the violence as ""horrific and unacceptable,"" urging the state government to take responsibility. ""Some woman lost their husband, some lost their son. People were dragged out of their homes and butchered. This is horrific. I don't know if such incidents have ever happened in West Bengal. We have seen all of this for the first time. This is unacceptable,"" she told reporters.NCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar, who led a delegation to Murshidabad, said the panel would soon submit its findings to the Centre. ""The suffering these people are going through is inhuman. We will put their demands in front of the government,"" she said.Meanwhile, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal staged protests across the country, including in Hyderabad, targeting the Mamata Banerjee-led government for its alleged inaction.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal accused the state government of allowing extremist forces to operate unchecked. ""We cannot let the country be on the verge of terrorism, and we will protect the Hindus from every danger. Mamata Banerjee herself acknowledged that foreign people were involved in the Murshidabad violence. If such is the case, was she sleeping? Why didn't she demand an NIA investigation?"" he said.Bansal further claimed that the Trinamool Congress government is acting against the interests of Hindus. ""We will remove this government of 'invaders'. Mamata Banerjee has been continuously supporting 'jihadis'. What the communist did earlier, she is doing now,"" he added.","Homes belonging to Hindu residents were marked with ink and kept under watch before being torched.

Bengaluru/Shivamogga: The principal and a second-division clerk of a Bidar college were dismissed on Saturday after a student was allegedly barred from answering the Common Entrance Test (CET) maths paper for coming to the examination hall wearing a janivara (sacred thread).A district commissioner's report revealed that the exam staff at Bidar's Sai Spoorthi PU College had mistaken the janivara for a metallic accessory, leading to a misapplication of the CET dress code. The student was later allowed to write the biology paper in Thursday's afternoon session.A similar incident was reported in Shivamogga too following which two home guards have been booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), prompting statewide debate over the handling of religious symbols in exam halls. The report found college principal Chandrasekhara Biradara and inspection staffer Satish Pawar negligent.The chief invigilator, Moddasir, was also informed about the incident but failed to resolve the issue or notify KEA, the report added.Based on the findings, the departments of pre-university and higher education recommended their dismissal, which Sai Spoorthi PU College formalised. However, it remains unclear if the affected student will be given a re-exam. The matter is expected to be discussed with the chief minister, said sources.In a similar incident in Shivamogga, three students at Adichunchanagiri PU College were reportedly asked to remove their janivaras Wednesday. One student refused but was still allowed to take the exam, while two others complied. The matter came to light after a complaint by Natraj Bhagavath of Karnataka Brahmin Sabha.Police registered an FIR and two of the home guards involved were suspended.A senior police officer said that when questioned college authorities said they only provided the premises and had no role in conducting or facilitating the exams. They also stated that the staff did not ask students to remove their sacred threads, but only the Kashi dhara (sacred thread worn around the wrist).Deputy commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said CCTV footage did not show sacred threads being discarded in a dustbin, indicating the student may have removed it voluntarily. ""The issue stemmed from the security guards' poor judgment rather than any deliberate action against the sacred thread,"" he noted.Home minister G Parameshwara condemned the incident, saying, ""It is a grave mistake, and I can't accept such things.""In Hubballi, Union minister Pralhad Joshi termed the incident ""an attack on the Janivara belief"", calling for clearer instructions from the state.",A student was allegedly barred from answering the Common Entrance Test (CET) maths paper for coming to the examination hall wearing a janivara.

Seelampur teen murder: 'Lady Don' held as cops probe gang rivalry angle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lady-don-under-lens-as-gang-revenge-angle-emerges-in-delhi-teens-murder/articleshow/120409591.cms,"Photo: X

NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur on Thursday evening, triggering tensions in the area. According to police, a local woman named Zikra, allegedly known as the 'lady don', has been detained and is being investigated in connection with the murder.Kunal’s family has alleged that Zikra, who once worked as a bouncer for jailed gangster Hashim Baba's wife Zoya, was present at the scene when he was killed.“Zikra used to roam around in the area with a pistol. An incident happened with her cousin Sahil but my son was not involved in it. Yet they killed him. They brutally stabbed him multiple times,” Kunal’s mother Parveen told news agency PTI.Zikra was reportedly living with Zoya before the latter’s arrest by Delhi Police in a drug-related case. After Zoya was jailed, Zikra was said to be forming her own gang.She was previously arrested under the Arms Act after she posted a video on social media brandishing a pistol. She is currently out on bail and had been living in a rented house close to Kunal’s residence.Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Pushpendra Kumar said, “We have identified the accused who will be nabbed soon. Ten teams have been formed to crack the case, and they are looking at all possible angles. We have detained a few people for questioning. The case will be solved soon.”CCTV footage led the police to identify two suspects, Sahil and Rehan, in connection with the stabbing. According to sources, Zikra has been detained for questioning, although no formal arrest has been made yet.The motive behind the murder appears to be an act of revenge. Sources revealed that Kunal may have been involved in an earlier attack on Zikra’s cousin Sahil. Police had registered an attempt to murder case against some members of Kunal’s community over that previous incident.“It is suspected that Kunal was also involved in the stabbing of Sahil. Although Sahil did not die, he, along with Zikra, hatched a plan to take revenge for the attack,” said a family source.Zikra reportedly was leading a gang of 10-12 youths, several of whom are now under scrutiny in connection with Kunal’s killing. Fear has reportedly gripped the locality, with some residents allegedly fleeing the area to escape possible retaliation.Amid growing unrest, local police and the Rapid Action Force (RAF) have been deployed to maintain order. Protests have been staged by local people and members of Hindu outfits, including the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). Posters bearing slogans like ""Hindus are migrating"" and ""Please help, Yoji ji"" appeared in the area but were later removed by the police.The incident has further escalated tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with both blaming each other for the breakdown of law and order in the national capital.","A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur.

My personal life will not impact my political responsibilities,” said the 60-year-old leader, adding that he fulfilled his mother’s long-standing wish by getting married.This is Ghosh’s first marriage and Majumdar’s second. She has a son from her previous marriage.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also sent flowers and a congratulatory note, though Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari declined to comment.The wedding, held as per Vedic rituals, was attended only by close family.

Happy Passia arrest in US a major milestone: Punjab DGP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/happy-passia-arrest-in-us-a-major-milestone-says-punjab-dgp/articleshow/120414798.cms,"Punjab police achieved a major breakthrough with the arrest of Happy Passia in California

<p>Terror incidents involving Passia<br></p>

Police hope Passia will be deported, not extradited

First Shifted To UK, Then To US

Cases Against Passia

Locals in native village prefer silence

(With inputs from Yudhvir Rana in Amritsar)

CHANDIGARH: Punjab police had recently initiated the process for getting red corner notice (RCN) issued against gangster-terrorist Harpreet Singh , aka Happy Passia, who was arrested in Califonia by the US authorities. Passia faces more than 30 cases which include at least 15 related to series of grenade attacks on police establishments and other targets in Punjab in the last few months.A blue notice had already been issued against Passia, a key operative of ISI-backed Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and close associate of Pakistan-based terrorist Harwinder Rinda. The blue notice relates to collecting additional information about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a criminal investigation.Describing Passia's arrest as a major milestone in the police's sustained crackdown on ISI-backed terror networks , Punjab director-general of police Gaurav Yadav, in a post on X said: ""Between 2023 and 2025, Happy Passia played a central role in orchestrating targeted killings, grenade attacks on police establishments, and extortion across Punjab and other states,"" adding that his arrest on April 17, 2025 was the outcome of excellent international cooperation and exchange of information between the US and India.The Punjab Police consistently shares intelligence with the central agencies, the DGP said.The DGP, in a video message, said that Passia started his criminal career and activities in the organised crime with Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang and his US-based associates Darman Kahlon and Amritpal. Subsequently, Passia came in contact with Rinda and carried out different acts by emerging as a primary node of terror modules at the behest of ISI.Passia was involved in many incidents after Sep 2024 in Punjab by masterminding his activities while being based in the US. ""Punjab police tracked him in a meticulous manner and dismantled his terror modules by doing complete mapping of his contacts,"" the DGP said, adding that an extensive dossier on Passia was shared with the central agencies and through appropriate channels the information was shared with US authorities, ultimately leading to his detention by the US authorities.""This is a manifestation that crime does not pay. Criminal has to come back and face the law. Punjab police is totally determined to keep the state safe and secure,"" DGP Yadav said.Punjab police are now hopeful that Passia would soon be deported like other illegal immigrants, without having to pursue a lengthy extradition procedure. A senior Punjab police officer told TOI: ""We believe that Passia will be deported like other illegal immigrants from the United States since US ICE was involved in his arrest. We don't think an extradition process would be required.""The officer added, ""If extradition route is taken, which is highly unlikely, it could take a long time. In extradition, on detention based on red corner notice, a request must be sent to the country where the wanted criminal is detained for a provisional arrest within 48 hours after getting information of detention. The accused is produced in a local court and is invariably sent to 60-day detention. Within these 60 days, a request by the State police through the Interpol division of the CBI must be made for extradition and the accused can contest that in the court in that country before the final decision is taken on the extradition.""In a report in Jan this year, TOI had highlighted that Passia, a matriculate who was behind the series of grenade attacks in Punjab, as per police, was using untraceable ""burner"" phone numbers with different country codes to evade tracking by the law enforcement agencies.Hailing from Passia village under Ramdas police station in Amritsar Rural police district, Passia who also goes by the alias of Jora, lived in the United Kingdom for a few months before illegally moving to the US through the Mexico border in 2021, as per a dossier on him.As per police, Passia has criminal associates residing in the UK - where he spent a few months in 2020-21 before illegally moving to the US - who provided him with burner phone numbers.Between Nov 2022 to April 2024, Passia was wanted in as many as 17 cases registered against him for alleged offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Arms Act, NDPS Acts and others including extortions. The number of cases against him has nearly doubled from April last year. As per Punjab police, Passia is involved in orchestrating at least 15 of the 22 cases of grenade attacks in Punjab in recent months.In Jan, National Investigation Agency (NIA) had announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh against Passia for his alleged role in Sep 2024 grenade attack targeted at a retired Punjab police officer in Chandigarh, the investigation of which was taken over by the NIA. Same month, a US district court also issued an arrest warrant against Passia, who had been declared absconder in the case, on an application filed by the NIA.Fear remains palpable in his village, Passia, situated near Ramdas in Ajnala Tehsil of Punjab's Amritsar district, with most residents avoiding discussions about him, often citing vague reasons.The gangster's mother, Bhupinder Kaur, and sister, Kirandeep Kaur, are in prison on various charges. ""His criminal network has deep roots, and investigations are ongoing to dismantle it fully,"" Amritsar (Rural) senior superintendent of police (SSP) Maninder Singh said.One villager, Kuljit Kaur, cautiously shared that Happy's father, Gurwinderpal Singh, a truck driver, had passed away when Happy was barely five years old. ""After his mother and sister were arrested, their house has remained locked. That's all I know,"" she said, quickly ending the conversation.

Trump's tattoo theory to prove MS-13 gang ties: What experts say about President's renewed focus on ink,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tattoo-theory-to-prove-ms-13-gang-ties-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-what-experts-say-about-presidents-renewed-focus-on-ink/articleshow/120425771.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s tattoos explained — as conspiracy theories run wild

President Donald Trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants , especially Venezuelans, drawing criticism from experts who say the practice is both flawed and misleading.Also read: Trump citing image of Gracia's hand to claim MS-13 connection Donald Trump recently invoked the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a 29-year-old Maryland resident deported to El Salvador on March 15, despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. Sharing an image of tattooed knuckles allegedly belonging to Abrego Garcia, Trump claimed: “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles... I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”.But multiple law enforcement officials and experts have warned against the Trump administration’s growing reliance on tattoos to determine gang affiliation — especially in the case of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua . “A tattoo itself is never sufficient evidence to prove a person is a member of a criminal group,” said Joseph Kenny, chief of detectives at the New York Police Department, according to a NYT report.Court documents and investigative reports indicate that US immigration officials are now using a 10-point scoring system under an internal guide — where gang-related tattoos can earn four points — to determine deportability under the Alien Enemies Act. Eight points are sufficient for expedited removal without a hearing. In one case, Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan makeup artist, was deported to El Salvador based solely on tattoos that read “Mom” and “Dad” inside crowns, according to a NYT report.While tattoos such as clocks, skulls, or train imagery have been linked to Tren de Aragua, five Venezuelan experts including police officials, academics, and a journalist told The New York Times that tattoos are not formal indicators of gang membership in Venezuelan street culture, where ink is common among young men regardless of affiliation.The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has further polarised debate. A New York Times video investigation debunked viral conspiracy theories that claimed his finger tattoos spelled out ""MS-13"" using a marijuana leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull. ICE officials reportedly told The Washington Post that they were unaware of such symbols being used by the gang. However, an ICE arrest report cited other tattoos — including skulls with eyes, ears, and mouths covered (a “see no evil” motif) and a devil with horns as signs of seniority within MS-13. His Chicago Bulls cap was also cited as evidence, according to the NYT report.Despite a Supreme Court ruling upholding the lower court’s order to reverse the deportation, the White House has remained firm. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, “Abrego Garcia will never live in the United States of America,” accusing him of gang ties.Meanwhile, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele mocked allegations of mistreatment, posting photos of Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with Senator Chris Van Hollen. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen,” he wrote on XLegal experts caution that even when tattoos are presented as evidence in court, they are rarely used as stand-alone proof. “A tattoo can be very telling. But are we going to base our decisions and law enforcement accusations and associations on a tattoo? Very, very unlikely,” said Ryan Brackley, assistant district attorney in Colorado’s Arapahoe County to NYTJohn Colello of the Los Angeles County DA’s gang homicide division agrees: “Facts and context are obviously important. Tattoos alone, or lack of tattoo, do not necessarily mean a person is, or is not, a gang member”","President Donald Trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants, especially Venezuelans.

What is the truth of the photoshopped photo?



What is MS-13?



Donald Trump has been accused of sharing a fake image of the knuckles Kilmar Abrego Garcia which shows MS-13 written on it. Social media users pointed out that the letters M, S and the numbers 1 and 3 are superimposed on the photo and those letters and numbers do not appear on any other photos of Garcia. Garcia is a Maryland father who came to the US illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported. When the Trump administration sent a number of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 members to Venezuela's notorious prison, Garcia was also sent along with them.In a court case, the Trump administration claimed that he was wrongly deported to El Salvador, following which the court ruled that he should be brought back. But now the White House has made it clear that the person is not coming back. As defense, the Trump administration said firstly the ball is in El Salvador's court as they will have to decide whether they would release their prisoner, which Salvador president Nayib Bukele denied. Secondly, the Trump administration released several pieces of evidence to establish that Garcia is an MS-13 member, and a criminal.The words M, S and 13 are not part of the tattoo and they were used in the photo that Trump shared to denote the meaning of the tattoo. On the knuckles of Garcia's four fingers on his left hand, there are tattoos of four symbols which stand for M, S, 1 and 3.“This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such “a fine and innocent person.” They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the 78-year-old wrote.Another photo has gone viral in this context, in which those tattoos are hidden by love emojis posted by his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura.MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles, California, in the 1980s. Formed by Salvadoran immigrants fleeing civil war, it initially aimed to protect community members from other gangs. Over time, it evolved into a violent criminal organization. The name ""Mara Salvatrucha"" likely derives from ""mara"" (gang), ""Salva"" (Salvador), and ""trucha"" (street smarts), with ""13"" possibly indicating its alliance with the Mexican Mafia, as M is the 13th letter of the alphabet.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a Maryland father who came to the US illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported.

Boston protesters accuse Trump of ‘building a police state’ and bypassing courts

Emotional release, community healing, and voter mobilization were key outcomes

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across the United States on Sunday in a fresh wave of anti-Trump protests , just two weeks after a similar nationwide mobilization. From Washington DC to San Francisco, the rallies were marked by a deep sense of urgency, anger, and fear over what protesters described as civil rights violations , executive overreach, and authoritarian tendencies under President Donald Trump.Although turnout in some cities like New York and Chicago was smaller than the April 5 protests, more than 700 events were organized, according to advocacy group 50501. The demonstrations spanned from Jacksonville, Florida, to Anchorage, Alaska, making it one of the most widespread waves of protests since Trump returned to political prominence.More than 700 events were registered under the 50501 campaign, making Saturday’s protest one of the largest decentralized demonstrations against Trump since 2017.While crowd sizes were smaller than the April 5 protests in some major cities, organizers highlighted the geographic spread as the true measure of momentum. Protests took place in small towns like Bisbee, Arizona, all the way to Anchorage, Alaska, where demonstrators braved freezing temperatures to raise signs reading “Democracy Not Dictatorship.”In Washington DC, protesters gathered in front of the White House and marched to the Department of Homeland Security to decry the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man sent to El Salvador despite a court ruling allowing him to stay.Activists chanted “Shame!” and waved upside-down American flags. “It feels like we’re past the Constitution,” said Elena Rodriguez, a DC resident and immigration rights advocate.Abrego Garcia’s case was cited in dozens of rallies across the country as emblematic of what critics call lawless deportation practices. In Chicago, protesters handed out flyers with Garcia’s face, labeling him “the canary in the coal mine.” Julia Fine, a Brooklyn resident, said, “The Salvadoran prison he’s in now is like Guantánamo without the cameras. This is what happens when executive power goes unchecked.”In New York City, hundreds gathered in Washington Square Park holding signs like “First they came for the immigrants…” and “No ICE in our state.” The atmosphere was tense but resolute. “I’m a citizen,” said Aaron Burk, “but the way things are going, anyone who looks like me is fair game.” Speakers warned of a growing network of unaccountable immigration enforcement, including unauthorized raids and surveillance.In Jacksonville, Florida, demonstrators condemned both the rollback of LGBTQ+ rights and the Trump administration’s decision to weaken the Endangered Species Act. “This isn’t just about one community,” said Sara Harvey, who held a rainbow flag and a cardboard cutout of a sea turtle. “They’re cutting protections for people and the planet.” The protest also drew attention to job cuts in the Department of Interior and Education, blamed on Trump’s alliance with business leaders like Elon Musk.Some rallies specifically targeted Tesla dealerships and SpaceX offices, symbolically linking Elon Musk to Trump’s push for a smaller federal government. Protesters in Austin, Texas, and Palo Alto, California, accused Musk of enabling federal downsizing that resulted in job losses across education, science, and public welfare sectors. “He’s playing kingmaker while people lose their livelihoods,” said Tanya Boon, a former EPA worker.In Chicago’s Daley Plaza, speakers emphasized how proposed Trump policies could dismantle key social programs. Signs read “Hands off Social Security” and “Veterans deserve better.” Fio Holloman, a 22-year-old protester, said her father—a Vietnam vet—recently lost a disability benefit. “It’s not just about Trump the man. It’s about Trumpism as policy,” she said.In Concord, Massachusetts, site of the Revolutionary War’s start 250 years ago, what began as a historical reenactment turned into a symbolic protest. Activists held signs reading “Stop Fascism Now” and “No Kings, No Trump.” Marchers dressed as 18th-century patriots drew comparisons between King George III and Donald Trump. “Our forefathers fought tyranny—why wouldn’t we?” said Mark Aldrich, a local historian turned protester.At Boston Common, hundreds rallied with signs condemning Trump’s alleged disregard for court rulings and checks on executive power. George Bryant, a teacher, said: “This is what fascism looks like: targeting students, flouting the courts, and threatening free speech.” One speaker called for the Justice Department to “intervene before it’s too late.”Beyond policy demands, many protesters described the day as emotionally necessary. In Cincinnati, Mayor Aftab Pureval joined the crowd and led chants of “Vote them out!” Social worker Andrea Mallory described the protest as “group therapy.” “I came here to scream. To grieve. To remember I’m not alone,” she said. Organizers handed out voter registration forms and “Know Your Rights” guides.","More than 700 events were registered under the 50501 campaign, making Saturday’s protest one of the largest decentralized demonstrations against Trump since 2017.

A man from Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, was arrested for allegedly cutting his wife's braid at a beauty parlour while she was getting her eyebrows done.

Barbara Lee wins tight race to become Oakland's next mayor-elect with Loren Taylor conceding

What is ranked-choice voting?

Ranked-choice voting, also called preferential voting, allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference instead of picking just one

If a candidate receives more than 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright.

If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.

Voters who chose the eliminated candidate then have their votes transferred to their next preference.

This process continues until a candidate secures a majority.

Supporters say this encourages candidates to appeal beyond their base, reduces polarisation, and gives voters more say

Critics argue that it confuses voters and delays results. Some also say it doesn’t reflect how strongly voters feel about their choices.

US president Donald Trump has called ranked-choice voting a ""fraudulent joke"" and a threat to democracy, shortly after Democrat Barbara Lee was elected as mayor of Oakland, California, through this very system.""Ranked-choice voting is one of the greatest threats to democracy. It is totally and very fraudulent joke,"" president Trump posted on Truth Social.Barbara Lee, known for her progressive stance and long-standing service in California politics, defeated former city councillor Loren Taylor. The final result came after nine rounds of vote tabulation, giving Lee just over 52% of the vote to Taylor’s 47%, according to Alameda County election officials.","Barbara Lee wins tight race to become Oakland's next mayor-elect with Loren Taylor conceding.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday at 12:17pm (IST), the National Center for Seismology confirmed. The tremors were felt in several parts of northern India, including Delhi-NCR and Jammu & Kashmir.A resident in Srinagar said, “I felt the tremor. I was in the office when my chair shook,” describing the momentary panic triggered by the quake.Though no immediate reports of damage or casualties have surfaced in India, authorities are monitoring the situation closely.Pakistan too experienced seismic activity earlier in the day, with the National Seismic Monitoring Centre reporting a 5.9 magnitude earthquake at 11:47am (local time). The epicentre was located near the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region at a depth of 94 kilometres.Tremors were widely felt across Pakistan, including in Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and several regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa such as Lower Dir, Bajaur, Malakand, Nowshera, Dir Bala, Shabqadar, and Mohmand, sparking panic among residents. However, no loss of life or property has been reported so far.This marks the second earthquake in the region within a week. A 5.5 magnitude quake had previously struck Pakistan’s capital and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces last Saturday.Pakistan remains highly vulnerable to seismic activity, with the 2005 earthquake being the deadliest in recent memory, claiming over 74,000 lives.","An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday at 12:17pm (IST) The tremors were felt in several parts of northern India, including Delhi-NCR and Jammu & Kashmir.

Thousands protest for trans rights in London after supreme court ruling

Thousands of people took to the streets in London and Edinburgh on Saturday to protest a recent UK supreme court ruling that defines a “woman” legally as someone assigned female at birth.Activists, trade unions, and members of the LGBTQ+ community held rallies in support of trans rights, waving flags and holding signs reading “trans women are women” and “trans rights are human rights.”The ruling, issued on Wednesday, has major implications for single-sex spaces and services such as toilets, changing rooms, and hospital wards. According to the court, these services “will function properly only if sex is interpreted as biological sex.”Many in the trans and non-binary community say the decision undermines their identity and increases their vulnerability.In London, police reported that seven statues near the protest were vandalised, including one of suffragette Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square.Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that “the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman”.In the law, “the words ‘sex’, ‘woman’ and ‘man’ … mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,” the judges wrote.The court’s decision followed a legal dispute between the Scottish government and campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS), which challenged Scotland’s interpretation of the Equality Act. While the Scottish government argued that trans women with a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) should have equal protections, the court disagreed.The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the supreme court, which held hearings in November.","Thousands of people took to the streets in London and Edinburgh on Saturday to protest a recent UK supreme court ruling.

Deadly plane crash under investigation in central Illinois

A small aircraft with four people on board crashed Saturday morning in a field near Trilla, a rural part of Illinois, around 65 miles south of Champaign, New York Times reported. The crash occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. and prompted an immediate response from emergency crews and state police.Illinois state police described the incident as “an active and ongoing fatal aircraft investigation” but did not specify how many of the four individuals died. Debris from the single-engine Cessna 180 was found scattered across a nearby roadway, which remained closed for several hours.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that the aircraft went down about 12 miles from Coles County Memorial Airport in Mattoon. Both the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have launched investigations to determine the cause of the crash. Officials have not confirmed if anyone on the ground was hurt.Governor JB Pritzker acknowledged the tragedy on social media, saying, “We keep those impacted by the plane crash in our thoughts today. Thank you to the first responders who rushed to the scene.”This crash adds to a recent string of small aircraft incidents in the United States. Just one day earlier, three people died in a plane crash in eastern Nebraska. And on April 12, six lives were lost when a twin-engine plane went down in New York.","A small aircraft with four people on board crashed Saturday morning in a field near Trilla, a rural part of Illinois.

BREAKING: US resumes nuclear weapons talks with Iran

The United States and Iran are preparing for a second round of nuclear talks in Oman on April 26, after a “very good progress” during Saturday’s discussions in Rome, a US official told Associated Press.US president Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi held a rare face-to-face meeting, a rare occurrence in US-Iran diplomacy.Araghchi had said earlier that technical-level talks would take place this week to iron out details. Speaking on Iranian state television, he described the Rome talks as “constructive” and expressed hope for further progress before the Oman meeting. “We reached a better understanding about a sort of principles and aims,” he added.While the US acknowledged both direct and indirect exchanges, Iranian officials insisted that most talks were still conducted through mediators. Oman’s foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been acting as a go-between, said, “These talks are gaining momentum and now even the unlikely is possible.”Trump, speaking on Friday, repeated his position: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon.”Ahead of the Rome talks, Witkoff met with Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which could play a role in monitoring any new agreement. Grossi also met with Araghchi.However, Iran remains firm on its nuclear rights. Senior Iranian adviser Ali Shamkhani said on social media that Iran is seeking a “balanced agreement, not a surrender.” This comment followed mixed messages from Witkoff on whether Iran could continue low-level enrichment.","US and Iran prepare for second round of nuclear talks in Oman on April 26.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said that Israel has “no choice” but to continue its military campaign in Gaza.He pledged to press ahead until Hamas is destroyed, the hostages are freed, and the region no longer poses a threat.Netanyahu has been facing pressure, with frustration growing among the families of Israeli hostages, reservist soldiers, and retired veterans. Demonstrations have become more frequent, calling on the government to secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages held by Hamas.Despite these calls, Netanyahu insisted: “I believe we can bring our hostages home without surrendering to Hamas’s dictates. We are at a critical stage of the campaign, and at this point, we need patience and determination to win.”In a televised statement on Saturday, Netanyahu said he would not retreat from his commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction. ""I'm committed to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I will not give up on this, I will not let go of it, and I will not retreat from it — not even by a millimetre,"" he said.Netanyahu’s remarks came after reports from Gaza’s health ministry said more than 90 Palestinians had been killed in 48 hours of Israeli airstrikes. Many of the victims were women and children. Among the dead were 15 people killed overnight, including those in a tent in the so-called “humanitarian zone” of Muwasi in Khan Younis. Four others, including a mother and her daughter, were killed in Rafah.In central Gaza, a separate airstrike west of Nuseirat killed one civilian, according to Al-Awda Hospital.The Israeli military claimed it had killed more than 40 militants over the weekend, while confirming the death of one soldier in northern Gaza — the first since the war resumed on March 18.Israel has tightened its blockade on Gaza for the past six weeks, halting the entry of food and essential goods. Aid agencies say the territory is facing a hunger crisis. The UN warned that thousands of children are becoming malnourished and most people are surviving on just one meal a day.The war, now stretching beyond six months, began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7. 2023, which killed around 1,200 people and led to the abduction of 251. While many hostages have since been released, Hamas is still holding 59, of whom 24 are believed to be alive.Israel’s military response has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and displaced around 90% of the population. Entire neighbourhoods lie in ruins, and most of Gaza’s food production has been wiped out.","Netanyahu says Israel has 'no choice' but to continue military campaign in Gaza.

This comes two days after the US targeted a key Red Sea port in Yemen, resulting in more than 70 fatalities.According to the rebels' media office, US forces conducted 13 airstrikes targeting an airport and port in Hodeida, along the Red Sea, and additional strikes in Sanaa.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The US military's Central Command, responsible for operations in the Middle East, was yet to respond to the Houthis' claim.Meanwhile, Thursday's strike on Ras Isa port, also in Hodeida province, resulted in 74 deaths and 171 injuries, according to the Houthi-administered health ministry. This made it the deadliest strike in America's ongoing military campaign against the Iranian-supported rebels of Yemen.Reacting to the Ras Isa attack, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned,"" as per a statement by his spokesman Stéphane Dujarric.

Its first major protest was on April 5 and today it was scaled up with more than 400 protests taking place across the country. Hunter Dunn, a spokesperson for 50501, described the group as a “pro-democracy, pro-Constitution, anti-executive overreach, nonviolent grassroots movement.” On what sets today's protest apart from the April 5 movement, Dunn said today's protest is more about awareness and less about protest.“We have registered Democrats, registered Independents and registered Republicans all marching because they all believe in America, because they all believe in a fair government that puts people before profits.”After the protest outside Vance's residence, the next spot was the Washington Monument, the database of the events said.JD Vance came under fire in connection with the deportation of Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father who has been living in the US illegally, though a court ruling in 2019 prohibited his deportation.

Hard truth: Elon Musk agrees with Bill Ackman as Trump gets major legal blow on deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hard-truth-elon-musk-agrees-with-bill-ackman-as-trump-gets-major-legal-blow-on-deportation/articleshow/120439374.cms,"Elon Musk and Bill Ackman commented on the Supreme Court ruling against Trump administration's deportation.

The Donald Trump administration received a major blow from the court as it has paused the deportation of immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act that the administration recently invoked. It was a 7-2 verdict as conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. An emergency appeal was filed at the high court on Friday claiming that some Venezuelans were at the immediate risk of being removed from the country without due process.The Saturday order did not explain why it decided to stall the deportation but said to the administration that the government can not remove any members of the putative class of detainees from the US until further order.The Alien Enemies Act, 1798 is a wartime law which authorizes the government to remove alien enemies. It is invoked during a declared war or any invasion or a predatory incursion. It was last invoked in World War Two. Trump invoked the Act to deport Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang members operating in the country, ""conducting irregular warfare"".It will not be the first time if the administration bypasses the ruling and reports them. In March, the administration did the same when it deported 238 alleged members of Tren de Aragua and 23 members of a Salvadoran gang to El Salvador. A US federal judge suspended the deportation but the administration contended that the planes exited the country when the ruling came.Billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman who recently voiced his displeasure at Trump tariff rued at the fact that each deportation is now being weighed on by the court. ""A nation in which one administration can allow millions of unvetted illegal migrants into the country, but requires that a court vet each deportation decision in an individually adjudicated case will soon lose the values our democratic system was intended to preserve,"" he said taking a jibe at the Joe Biden administration for allowing the illegals to enter the country.Elon Musk agreed and wrote: ""This is the hard truth"".Musk also shared a statement by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who said all human rights are not the same and the most important human right is the right to life.

Among victims, a friend of Bill Clinton

Former US President Bill Clinton on Saturday delivered the keynote address at a remembrance ceremony on the 30th anniversary of the deadly Oklahoma City bombings , the worst homegrown attack in America's history, one which occurred during his presidency.Clinton was president on April 19, 1995, when a truck bomb exploded, destroying the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, and killing 168 people. The victims included 19 children.The Democrat, now 78, said at the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum , ""I still remember as if it were 30 minutes ago, coming here with (wife) Hillary to that memorial service and saying: 'You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything. You have certainly not lost America, and we will be with you for as many tomorrows as it takes'.""Clinton has spoken at previous remembrance ceremonies since 1995, most recently at the 20th anniversary in 2015. .On Saturday, the ex-president also cautioned about the ""polarising"" nature of modern-day politics and how such ""divisiveness"" can lead to violence, just as it did on that fateful day. He also called on Americans to ""learn"" from the ""Oklahoma Standard,"" a term coined to reference the city's response to the bombing by uniting in service, honour and kindness.He stated, ""Today, Oklahoma City, America needs you. I wish to goodness every American could just see life unfold here, hearing these stories.""However, Clinton has another connection with the Oklahoma City bombings. Among the 168 victims was his friend Alan Whicher, a US Secret Service agent who initial security detail before being transferred to Oklahoma City.Whicher had lived there for seven months before April 19, 1995.In a recent interview with The Oklahoman, Clinton remembered his deceased friend.He said, ""You know I liked him a lot and I missed him when he left. So I was determined to do what I could to help Oklahoma City become the place he thought it was when he went there.""(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Clinton was president on April 19, 1995, when a truck bomb exploded, destroying the nine-story Alfred P.

Trump would have deported even Jesus Christ: Tim Walz's daughter on deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-would-have-deported-even-jesus-christ-tim-walzs-daughter-on-deportation-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia/articleshow/120438329.cms,"Donald Trump administration made it clear that Kilmar Garcia is not coming back to US.

White House vs Kilmar Abrego Garcia



Minnesota Govenor and former vice presidential candidate (Dem) Tim Walz's daughter Hope Walz spoke her mind about the row over the deportation of Maryland's Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was 'mistakenly deported' to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration but now the White House asserted that they won't bring him back as he is an MS-13 gang member. ""If Jesus were alive today and in the United States, this administration would have already taken him and removed him from this country without due process,"" Hope said in a video, adding that the administration would have claimed that Jesus is a member of the MS-13 gang.""Some people don't want to talk about that. It truly is baffling how clear and laid out everything is and there is still people standing by it. I believe in the good of people and like humanity, humans, you know...deep down at our core, like we care about each other... but that's really being tested. Because how anyone is okay with this is terrifying to me,"" Hope said urging people to speak up about it.The court asked the Trump administration to bring back Garcia but when Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele came to meet Donald Trump in the White House, it became evident that the tacit understanding between the US and El Salvador is that Garcia is not coming back. The US administration said it would send a plane to Salvador if the government there decides to release Garcia. Bukele outrightly rejected the proposal, called it preposterous to even think of releasing a criminal.Now it has become White House vs Garcia as the administration has been releasing unknown details about Garcia. Even President Donald Trump shared a photo of Garcia's knuckles with Ms-13 tattooed on them, though the photo was called fake on social media. ""This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ""a fine and innocent person"","" Trump posted.The government on Wednesday released documents from two interactions Abrego Garcia had with law enforcement or the courts system: a 2019 arrest that didn’t lead to charges or a conviction, but did result in his detention by immigration officials, and a 2021 protective order his wife filed against him alleging domestic violence, which she later decided against pursuing further after she said the couple had resolved their issues.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was'mistakenly deported' to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration.

Will the Trump administration defy court order again?



The Supreme Court on Saturday paused the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas for the time being. The court directed the trump administration not to remove the Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further order. It was a 7-2 verdict with Justice Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissenting. The verdict came in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union which contended that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua. The Act has only been invoked three previous times in US history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the Act gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.Reacting to the verdict, right-wing author Ann Coulter wrote: ""Luckily, the Supreme Court wasn't elected president. Keep deporting the infiltrators, POTUS.""The White House did not issue any statement reacting to the court order though it will not be anything new if they defy the order as the Trump administration already ignored the court order involving Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The court ordered the administration to bring back the mistakenly deported man. But the Trump administration made it clear that he would not be brought back. The issue has snowballed into a major political row and Marylan Dem senator went to El Salvador to meet the man, imprisoned in Salvador's most notorious detention center and even Donald Trump issued a statement mocking him.",The court directed the trump administration not to remove the Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further order.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday.

Ahmadiyya minority beaten to death by anti-blasphemy group in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ahmadiyya-minority-beaten-to-death-by-anti-blasphemy-group-in-pakistan/articleshow/120412129.cms,"A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi’s Saddar neighbourhood.The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans before surrounding the colonial-era worship site. Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.
